# Containerize a Bun application with Docker

<Note>
  This guide assumes you already have [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) installed.
</Note>

[Docker](https://www.docker.com) is a platform for packaging and running an application as a lightweight, portable *container* that encapsulates all the necessary dependencies.

***

To *containerize* the application, define a `Dockerfile`. It lists the instructions to initialize the container, copy your local project files into it, install dependencies, and start the application.

```docker Dockerfile icon="docker" theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"dracula"}}
# use the official Bun image
# see all versions at https://hub.docker.com/r/oven/bun/tags
FROM oven/bun:1 AS base
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# install dependencies into temp directory
# this will cache them and speed up future builds
FROM base AS install
RUN mkdir -p /temp/dev
COPY package.json bun.lock /temp/dev/
RUN cd /temp/dev && bun install --frozen-lockfile

# install with --production (exclude devDependencies)
RUN mkdir -p /temp/prod
COPY package.json bun.lock /temp/prod/
RUN cd /temp/prod && bun install --frozen-lockfile --production

# copy node_modules from temp directory
# then copy all (non-ignored) project files into the image
FROM base AS prerelease
COPY --from=install /temp/dev/node_modules node_modules
COPY . .

# [optional] tests & build
ENV NODE_ENV=production
RUN bun test
RUN bun run build

# copy production dependencies and source code into final image
FROM base AS release
COPY --from=install /temp/prod/node_modules node_modules
COPY --from=prerelease /usr/src/app/index.ts .
COPY --from=prerelease /usr/src/app/package.json .

# run the app
USER bun
EXPOSE 3000/tcp
ENTRYPOINT [ "bun", "run", "index.ts" ]
```

***

Next, add a `.dockerignore` file. It uses the same syntax as `.gitignore` and lists the files and directories to exclude from every stage of the Docker build. For example:

```txt .dockerignore icon="docker" theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"dracula"}}
node_modules
Dockerfile*
docker-compose*
.dockerignore
.git
.gitignore
README.md
LICENSE
.vscode
Makefile
helm-charts
.env
.editorconfig
.idea
coverage*
```

***

Run `docker build` to convert this `Dockerfile` into a *Docker image*, a self-contained template containing all the dependencies and configuration required to run the application.

The `-t` flag names the image, and `--pull` tells Docker to download the latest version of the base image (`oven/bun`). The initial build takes longer, since Docker downloads all the base images and dependencies.

```bash terminal icon="terminal" theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"dracula"}}
docker build --pull -t bun-hello-world .
```

```txt theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"dracula"}}

***

Now start a running *container* from the `bun-hello-world` image with `docker run`. The `-d` flag runs it in *detached* mode, and `-p 3000:3000` maps the container's port 3000 to port 3000 on your machine.

The `run` command prints the *container ID*.

```sh terminal icon="terminal" theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"dracula"}}
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 bun-hello-world
```

```txt theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"dracula"}}
7f03e212a15ede8644379bce11a13589f563d3909a9640446c5bbefce993678d
```

***

The container is now running in the background. Visit [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). You should see a `Hello, World!` message.

***

To stop the container, run `docker stop <container-id>`.

```sh terminal icon="terminal" theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"dracula"}}
docker stop 7f03e212a15ede8644379bce11a13589f563d3909a9640446c5bbefce993678d
```

***

If you can't find the container ID, `docker ps` lists all running containers.

```sh terminal icon="terminal" theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"dracula"}}
docker ps
```

```txt theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"dracula"}}
