# Using bun install with Artifactory

[JFrog Artifactory](https://jfrog.com/artifactory/) is a package management system for npm, Docker, Maven, NuGet, Ruby, Helm, and more. You can use it to host your own private npm registry, along with other types of packages.

To use it with `bun install`, add a `bunfig.toml` file to your project with the following contents:

***

### Configure with bunfig.toml

Replace `MY_SUBDOMAIN` with your JFrog Artifactory subdomain, such as `jarred1234`, and `MY_TOKEN` with your JFrog Artifactory token.

```toml bunfig.toml icon="settings" theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"dracula"}}
[install.registry]
url = "https://MY_SUBDOMAIN.jfrog.io/artifactory/api/npm/npm/_auth=MY_TOKEN"
# You can use an environment variable here
# url = "$NPM_CONFIG_REGISTRY"
```

***

### Configure with `$NPM_CONFIG_REGISTRY`

As with npm, you can set the `NPM_CONFIG_REGISTRY` environment variable to configure JFrog Artifactory for `bun install`.
