# Write a file to stdout

Bun exposes `stdout` as a `BunFile` with the `Bun.stdout` property. Pass it as the destination to [`Bun.write()`](/docs/runtime/file-io#writing-files-bun-write).

The following code writes a file to `stdout`, like the Unix `cat` command.

```ts cat.ts icon="https://mintcdn.com/bun-1dd33a4e/JUhaF6Mf68z_zHyy/icons/typescript.svg?fit=max&auto=format&n=JUhaF6Mf68z_zHyy&q=85&s=7ac549adaea8d5487d8fbd58cc3ea35b" theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"dracula"}}
const path = "/path/to/file.txt";
const file = Bun.file(path);
await Bun.write(Bun.stdout, file);
```

See [`Bun.write()`](/docs/runtime/file-io#writing-files-bun-write).
