# Read a file to a Buffer

The `Bun.file()` function accepts a path and returns a `BunFile` instance. `BunFile` extends `Blob`, so you can read the file lazily in a variety of formats.

To read the file into a `Buffer`, read it as an `ArrayBuffer` with `.arrayBuffer()`, then pass the result to `Buffer.from()`.

const path = "/path/to/package.json";
const file = Bun.file(path);

const arrbuf = await file.arrayBuffer();
const buffer = Buffer.from(arrbuf);
```

See [Buffer](/docs/runtime/binary-data#buffer) for more on working with `Buffer` and other binary data formats in Bun.
