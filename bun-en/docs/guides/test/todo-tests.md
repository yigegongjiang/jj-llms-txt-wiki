# Mark a test as a "todo" with the Bun test runner

To remind yourself to write a test later, use the `test.todo` function. An implementation isn't required.

```ts test.ts icon="https://mintcdn.com/bun-1dd33a4e/JUhaF6Mf68z_zHyy/icons/typescript.svg?fit=max&auto=format&n=JUhaF6Mf68z_zHyy&q=85&s=7ac549adaea8d5487d8fbd58cc3ea35b" theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"dracula"}}
import { test, expect } from "bun:test";

// write this later
test.todo("unimplemented feature");
```

***

The `bun test` output reports the number of `todo` tests.

```sh terminal icon="terminal" theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"dracula"}}
bun test
```

```txt theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"dracula"}}
test.test.ts:
✓ add [0.03ms]
✓ multiply [0.02ms]
✎ unimplemented feature

 2 pass
 1 todo
 0 fail
 2 expect() calls
Ran 3 tests across 1 file. [74.00ms]
```

***

You can provide a test implementation.

```ts theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"dracula"}}
import { test, expect } from "bun:test";

test.todo("unimplemented feature", () => {
  expect(Bun.isAwesome()).toBe(true);
});
```

***

Bun doesn't run the implementation unless you pass the `--todo` flag. With `--todo`, the test runs and is *expected to fail*. If a todo test passes, `bun test` returns a non-zero exit code.

```sh terminal icon="terminal" theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"dracula"}}
bun test --todo
```

```txt theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"dracula"}}
my.test.ts:
✗ unimplemented feature
  ^ this test is marked as todo but passes. Remove `.todo` if tested behavior now works

 0 pass
 1 fail
 1 expect() calls
$ echo $?
1 # this is the exit code of the previous command
```
