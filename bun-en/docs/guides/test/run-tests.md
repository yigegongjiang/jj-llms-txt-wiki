# Run your tests with the Bun test runner

Bun has a built-in [test runner](/docs/test) with a Jest-like `expect` API.

***

To use it, run `bun test` from your project directory. The test runner recursively searches for files matching the following patterns and runs the tests they contain.

```txt File Tree icon="folder-tree" theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"dracula"}}
*.test.{js|jsx|ts|tsx}
*_test.{js|jsx|ts|tsx}
*.spec.{js|jsx|ts|tsx}
*_spec.{js|jsx|ts|tsx}
```

***

Here's the output of a typical run: three test files (`test.test.js`, `test2.test.js`, and `test3.test.js`), each containing two tests (`add` and `multiply`).

```sh terminal icon="terminal" theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"dracula"}}
bun test
```

```txt theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"dracula"}}
test.test.js:
✓ add [0.87ms]
✓ multiply [0.02ms]

test2.test.js:
✓ add [0.72ms]
✓ multiply [0.01ms]

test3.test.js:
✓ add [0.54ms]
✓ multiply [0.01ms]

 6 pass
 0 fail
 6 expect() calls
Ran 6 tests across 3 files. [9.00ms]
```

***

To only run certain test files, pass a positional argument to `bun test`. The runner only executes files with that argument in their path.

```sh terminal icon="terminal" theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"dracula"}}
bun test test3
```

```txt theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"dracula"}}
test3.test.js:
✓ add [1.40ms]
✓ multiply [0.03ms]

 2 pass
 0 fail
 2 expect() calls
Ran 2 tests across 1 files. [15.00ms]
```

***

Every test has a name: the first argument to the `test` function. Tests can also be grouped into suites with `describe`.

```ts theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"dracula"}}
import { test, expect, describe } from "bun:test";

describe("math", () => {
  test("add", () => {
    expect(2 + 2).toEqual(4);
  });

  test("multiply", () => {
    expect(2 * 2).toEqual(4);
  });
});
```

***

To filter tests by name, use the `-t`/`--test-name-pattern` flag.

`-t add` only runs tests with "add" in the name. The pattern matches test names defined with `test` and suite names defined with `describe`.

```sh terminal icon="terminal" theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"dracula"}}
bun test -t add
```

```txt theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"dracula"}}
test.test.js:
✓ add [1.79ms]

test2.test.js:
✓ add [2.30ms]

test3.test.js:
✓ add [0.32ms]

 3 pass
 3 filtered out
 0 fail
 3 expect() calls
Ran 3 tests across 3 files. [59.00ms]
```
