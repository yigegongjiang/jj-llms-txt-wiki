# Set a per-test timeout with the Bun test runner

Use the `--timeout` flag to set a timeout for each test in milliseconds. A test that exceeds this timeout is marked as failed.

The default timeout is `5000` (5 seconds).

```sh terminal icon="terminal" theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"dracula"}}
bun test --timeout 3000 # 3 seconds
```
