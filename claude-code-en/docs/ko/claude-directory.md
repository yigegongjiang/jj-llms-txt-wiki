- Project uses custom Result<T, E> type, not exceptions
- Auth middleware expects Bearer token in Authorization header
- Tests use factory functions in test/factories/

## Recurring issues
- Missing null checks on API responses (src/api/*)
- Unhandled promise rejections in background jobs`

Claude Code는 프로젝트 디렉토리와 홈 디렉토리의 `~/.claude`에서 지침, 설정, skills, subagents, 메모리를 읽습니다. 프로젝트 파일을 git에 커밋하여 팀과 공유합니다. `~/.claude`의 파일은 모든 프로젝트에 적용되는 개인 설정입니다.

Windows에서 `~/.claude`는 `%USERPROFILE%\.claude`로 확인됩니다. [`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`](/docs/ko/env-vars)을 설정하면, 이 페이지의 모든 `~/.claude` 경로가 대신 해당 디렉토리 아래에 있습니다.

대부분의 사용자는 `CLAUDE.md`와 `settings.json`만 편집합니다. 디렉토리의 나머지는 선택 사항입니다. 필요에 따라 skills, rules, subagents를 추가합니다.

`~/.claude`는 또한 작업할 때 Claude Code가 작성하는 데이터를 보유합니다. 트랜스크립트, 프롬프트 기록, 파일 스냅샷, 캐시, 로그입니다. 아래의 [애플리케이션 데이터](#application-data)를 참조하세요.

이 표는 탐색기가 다루는 모든 파일을 나열합니다. 프로젝트 범위 파일은 `.claude/` 아래의 리포지토리에 있습니다 (또는 `CLAUDE.md`, `.mcp.json`, `.worktreeinclude`의 경우 루트에 있음). 전역 범위 파일은 `~/.claude/`에 있으며 모든 프로젝트에 적용됩니다.

<Note>
  이 파일에 입력한 내용을 재정의할 수 있는 여러 가지가 있습니다.

  * 조직에서 배포한 [관리 설정](/docs/ko/server-managed-settings)이 모든 것보다 우선합니다.
  * `--permission-mode` 또는 `--settings`와 같은 CLI 플래그는 해당 세션에 대해 `settings.json`을 재정의합니다.
  * 일부 환경 변수는 동등한 설정보다 우선하지만, 이는 다양합니다. 각각에 대해 [환경 변수 참조](/docs/ko/env-vars)를 확인하세요.

트랜스크립트 및 기록은 저장 시 암호화되지 않습니다. OS 파일 권한이 유일한 보호입니다. 도구가 `.env` 파일을 읽거나 명령이 자격 증명을 인쇄하면, 해당 값이 `projects/<project>/<session>.jsonl`에 작성됩니다. 노출을 줄이려면:

* `cleanupPeriodDays`를 낮춰 트랜스크립트를 유지하는 기간을 단축합니다.
* [`CLAUDE_CODE_SKIP_PROMPT_HISTORY`](/docs/ko/env-vars) 환경 변수를 설정하여 모든 모드에서 트랜스크립트 및 프롬프트 기록 작성을 건너뜁니다. 비대화형 모드에서는 대신 `-p`와 함께 `--no-session-persistence`를 전달하거나 Agent SDK에서 `persistSession: false`를 설정할 수 있습니다.
* [권한 규칙](/docs/ko/permissions)을 사용하여 자격 증명 파일의 읽기를 거부합니다.

`claude project purge`를 실행하여 한 프로젝트에 대해 Claude Code가 보유한 상태를 삭제합니다. 이 명령은 Claude Code v2.1.124 이상이 필요합니다. 다음을 삭제합니다:

* `projects/` 아래의 트랜스크립트 및 자동 메모리
* 세션별 `tasks/`, `debug/`, `file-history/` 항목
* `history.jsonl`의 일치하는 프롬프트 라인
* `~/.claude.json`의 프로젝트 항목

이 명령은 전체 삭제 계획을 인쇄하고 항목을 제거하기 전에 확인을 요청합니다.

삭제하지 않고 계획을 미리 봅니다:

```bash theme={null}
claude project purge ~/work/my-repo --dry-run
```

단일 확인 프롬프트로 삭제합니다:

```bash theme={null}
claude project purge ~/work/my-repo
```

경로를 생략하여 대화형 목록에서 프로젝트를 선택합니다.

스크립트에서 사용하기 위해 확인 프롬프트를 건너뜁니다:

```bash theme={null}
claude project purge ~/work/my-repo --yes
```

경로 대신 `--all`을 전달하여 한 번에 모든 프로젝트의 상태를 제거합니다. 이는 `history.jsonl`을 필터링하지 않고 완전히 삭제합니다. `-i`를 전달하여 삭제 계획을 한 번에 하나씩 단계별로 진행합니다.

이 명령은 프로젝트 범위가 아니므로 `shell-snapshots/` 및 `backups/`는 그대로 두고 계획 출력에서 이에 대해 경고합니다. 주어진 경로와 일치하는 상태가 없으면 상태 1로 종료됩니다.

위의 애플리케이션 데이터 경로를 언제든지 손으로 삭제할 수 있습니다. 새 세션은 영향을 받지 않습니다. 아래 표는 과거 세션에서 손실되는 항목을 보여줍니다.
