# Connect Workers to Cloudflare Mesh

Last updated Jun 16, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-vpc/examples/connect-to-cloudflare-mesh/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

This example demonstrates how to use a VPC Network binding with [Cloudflare Mesh](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-mesh/) (formerly WARP Connector) to connect to any private service in your account from a Worker — without pre-registering individual hosts or specifying a Cloudflare Tunnel UUID.

When you bind to [Cloudflare Mesh](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-mesh/) using `network_id: "cf1:network"`, your Worker can reach any Mesh node, client device, subnet or hostname route announced through Cloudflare Tunnel or Cloudflare Mesh, or destination connected through a [Cloudflare WAN](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-wan/) on-ramp (GRE, IPsec, or CNI).

## Prerequisites

* A [Cloudflare Mesh](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-mesh/) node connected to your private network
* Private services running behind your Mesh node (for example, an internal API, database, or web application)

## 1\. Configure your Worker

Bind your Worker to Cloudflare Mesh using `network_id: "cf1:network"` in your Wrangler configuration:

```jsonc
{
	"$schema": "./node_modules/wrangler/config-schema.json",
	"name": "mesh-gateway",
	"main": "src/index.js",
	// Set this to today's date
	"compatibility_date": "2026-07-24",
	"vpc_networks": [
		{
			"binding": "MESH",
			"network_id": "cf1:network",
			"remote": true
		}
	]
}
```

```toml
"$schema" = "./node_modules/wrangler/config-schema.json"
name = "mesh-gateway"
main = "src/index.js"
# Set this to today's date
compatibility_date = "2026-07-24"

[[vpc_networks]]
binding = "MESH"
network_id = "cf1:network"
remote = true
```

With this single binding, your Worker can reach any service across all Cloudflare Tunnels, Mesh nodes, and Cloudflare WAN on-ramps in your account.

## 2\. Implement the Worker

Use the VPC Network binding to access services by private IP address. Cloudflare Mesh currently supports IP-based routing only.

```js
// You can target a Mesh node directly by its Mesh IP or any private IP
// on a subnet route behind the node
const SERVICE_IP = "10.0.1.50";
const SERVICE_PORT = 8080;

export default {
	async fetch(request, env, ctx) {
		try {
			const response = await env.MESH.fetch(
				`http://${SERVICE_IP}:${SERVICE_PORT}/api/data`,
			);
			return response;
		} catch (error) {
			// fetch() throws if the VPC Network cannot connect to the target
			return new Response("Service unavailable", { status: 503 });
		}
	},
};
```

Unlike [VPC Services](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-vpc/configuration/vpc-services/), the URL you pass to `fetch()` or the address you pass to `connect()` determines the actual destination. You can reach any IP and port accessible through your Mesh network without creating separate bindings for each service.

### TCP connections

You can also use `connect()` to open raw TCP sockets to non-HTTP services through the same binding:

```js
// You can target a Mesh node directly by its Mesh IP or any private IP
// on a subnet route behind the node
const REDIS_IP = "10.0.1.50";
const REDIS_PORT = 6379;

export default {
	async fetch(request, env, ctx) {
		try {
			const socket = await env.MESH.connect(`${REDIS_IP}:${REDIS_PORT}`);

			const writer = socket.writable.getWriter();
			await writer.write(new TextEncoder().encode("PING\r\n"));
			await writer.close();

			return new Response(socket.readable);
		} catch (error) {
			// connect() throws if the VPC Network cannot connect to the target
			return new Response("Service unavailable", { status: 503 });
		}
	},
};
```

## 3\. Deploy and test

Deploy your Worker and verify it can reach your private services:

```bash
npx wrangler deploy
```

```bash
# Test accessing the internal user API
curl https://mesh-gateway.workers.dev/api/users

# Test accessing metrics by private IP
curl https://mesh-gateway.workers.dev/api/metrics
```
