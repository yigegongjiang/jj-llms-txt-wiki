# Access a private API or website

Last updated Apr 22, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-vpc/examples/private-api/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

This example demonstrates how to access a private REST API that is not exposed to the public internet. In this guide, we will configure a VPC Service for an internal API, create a Worker that makes requests to that API, and deploy the Worker to validate our changes.

## Prerequisites

* A virtual machine/EC2 instance running in your VPC/virtual network
* A private API or website running in your VPC/virtual network with security rules allowing access to the virtual machine that will be running `cloudflared`
* Workers account with Workers VPC access

## 1\. Set up Cloudflare Tunnel

A Cloudflare Tunnel creates a secure connection from your private network to Cloudflare. This tunnel will allow Workers to securely access your private resources.

1. Navigate to the [Workers VPC dashboard ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/workers/vpc/tunnels) and select the **Tunnels** tab.
2. Select **Create** to create a new tunnel.
3. Enter a name for your tunnel (for example, `private-api-tunnel`) and select **Save tunnel**.
4. Choose your operating system and architecture. The dashboard will provide specific installation instructions for your environment.
5. Follow the provided commands to download and install `cloudflared` on your VM, and execute the service installation command with your unique token.

The dashboard will confirm when your tunnel is successfully connected. Note the tunnel ID for the next step.

## 2\. Create the Workers VPC Service

First, create a Workers VPC Service for your internal API:

```bash
npx wrangler vpc service create api-service \
  --type http \
  --tunnel-id <YOUR_TUNNEL_ID> \
  --ipv4 10.0.1.50 \
  --http-port 8080
```

You can also create a VPC Service for a service using its hostname:

```bash
npx wrangler vpc service create api-service \
  --type http \
  --tunnel-id <YOUR_TUNNEL_ID> \
  --hostname internal-hostname.example.com
```

Note the service ID returned for the next step.

## 3\. Configure your Worker

Update your Wrangler configuration file:

```jsonc
{
	"$schema": "./node_modules/wrangler/config-schema.json",
	"name": "private-api-gateway",
	"main": "src/index.js",
	// Set this to today's date
	"compatibility_date": "2026-07-24",
	"vpc_services": [
		{
			"binding": "INTERNAL_API",
			"service_id": "<YOUR_SERVICE_ID>",
			"remote": true
		}
	]
}
```

```toml
"$schema" = "./node_modules/wrangler/config-schema.json"
name = "private-api-gateway"
main = "src/index.js"
# Set this to today's date
compatibility_date = "2026-07-24"

[[vpc_services]]
binding = "INTERNAL_API"
service_id = "<YOUR_SERVICE_ID>"
remote = true
```

## 4\. Implement the Worker

In your Workers code, use the VPC Service binding in order to send requests to the service:

```js
export default {
	async fetch(request, env, ctx) {
		try {
			// Fetch data from internal API and process it before returning
			const response = await env.INTERNAL_API.fetch("http://10.0.1.50:8080/api/data");

			// Use the response of the private API to perform more logic in Workers, before returning the final response
			return response;
		} catch (error) {
			return new Response("Service unavailable", { status: 503 });
		}
	},
};
```

This guide demonstrates how you could create a simple proxy in your Workers. However, you could use VPC Services to fetch APIs directly and manipulate the responses to enable you to build more full-stack and backend functionality on Workers.

## 5\. Deploy and test

Now, you can deploy and test your Worker that you have created:

```bash
npx wrangler deploy
```

```bash
# Test GET request
curl https://private-api-gateway.workers.dev
```

## Next steps

* Add [authentication and authorization](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/examples/auth-with-headers/)
* Implement [rate limiting](https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/api/)
* Set up [monitoring and alerting](https://developers.cloudflare.com/analytics/analytics-engine/)
* Explore [other examples](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-vpc/examples/)
