# Aggregate functions

Last updated Jun 22, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2-sql/sql-reference/aggregate-functions/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Aggregate functions collapse multiple rows into a single result. They are used with `GROUP BY` to compute summaries per group, or without `GROUP BY` to compute a single result across all rows.

Most aggregates accept a `DISTINCT` modifier, for example `COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id)` or `SUM(DISTINCT total_amount)`.

Note

On large datasets, prefer the [approximate aggregates](#approximate-aggregates) (`approx_distinct`, `approx_median`, `approx_percentile_cont`) over their exact counterparts for lower memory and compute.

---

## Basic aggregates

### COUNT

Counts rows. `COUNT(*)` counts all rows. `COUNT(column)` counts non-NULL values.

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows
FROM my_namespace.sales_data

SELECT department, COUNT(*) AS dept_count
FROM my_namespace.sales_data
GROUP BY department
ORDER BY dept_count DESC
```

### SUM

Returns the sum of values in a column.

```sql
SELECT SUM(total_amount) AS grand_total
FROM my_namespace.sales_data

SELECT department, SUM(total_amount) AS dept_total
FROM my_namespace.sales_data
GROUP BY department
ORDER BY dept_total DESC
```

### AVG

Returns the average of values in a column. Alias: `mean`.

```sql
SELECT AVG(total_amount) AS avg_amount
FROM my_namespace.sales_data

SELECT department, AVG(total_amount) AS avg_amount
FROM my_namespace.sales_data
GROUP BY department
ORDER BY avg_amount DESC
```

### MIN

Returns the minimum value. Works on numeric and string columns.

```sql
SELECT MIN(total_amount) AS min_amount, MIN(customer_id) AS first_customer
FROM my_namespace.sales_data

SELECT department, MIN(total_amount) AS min_amount
FROM my_namespace.sales_data
GROUP BY department
```

### MAX

Returns the maximum value. Works on numeric and string columns.

```sql
SELECT MAX(total_amount) AS max_amount, MAX(customer_id) AS last_customer
FROM my_namespace.sales_data

SELECT department, MAX(total_amount) AS max_amount
FROM my_namespace.sales_data
GROUP BY department
```

### MEDIAN

Returns the exact median value. For large datasets, use [approx\_median](#approx%5Fmedian) instead.

```sql
SELECT MEDIAN(total_amount) AS median_amount
FROM my_namespace.sales_data

SELECT department, MEDIAN(total_amount) AS median_amount
FROM my_namespace.sales_data
GROUP BY department
```

### PERCENTILE\_CONT

Returns the exact value at a given percentile using `WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY ...)`. The percentile parameter must be between `0.0` and `1.0` inclusive. For large datasets, use [approx\_percentile\_cont](#approx%5Fpercentile%5Fcont) instead.

```sql
SELECT PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY total_amount) AS median,
       PERCENTILE_CONT(0.95) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY total_amount) AS p95
FROM my_namespace.sales_data
```

Note

`PERCENTILE_DISC` is not supported. Use `PERCENTILE_CONT` or [approx\_percentile\_cont](#approx%5Fpercentile%5Fcont).

---

## Approximate aggregates

Approximate aggregation functions produce statistically estimated results while using significantly less memory and compute than their exact counterparts. Use them when analyzing large datasets and an approximate result is acceptable.

### approx\_percentile\_cont

Returns the approximate value at a given percentile using a T-Digest algorithm. The percentile parameter must be between `0.0` and `1.0` inclusive.

```sql
SELECT approx_percentile_cont(total_amount, 0.5) AS median,
       approx_percentile_cont(total_amount, 0.95) AS p95
FROM my_namespace.sales_data

SELECT department,
       approx_percentile_cont(total_amount, 0.5) AS median
FROM my_namespace.sales_data
GROUP BY department
ORDER BY median DESC
```

### approx\_percentile\_cont\_with\_weight

Returns the approximate weighted percentile. Rows are weighted by the `weight` column.

```sql
SELECT approx_percentile_cont_with_weight(unit_price, quantity, 0.5) AS weighted_median
FROM my_namespace.sales_data
WHERE unit_price IS NOT NULL AND quantity IS NOT NULL
```

### approx\_median

Returns the approximate median. Equivalent to `approx_percentile_cont(column, 0.5)`.

```sql
SELECT approx_median(total_amount) AS median_amount
FROM my_namespace.sales_data

SELECT department, approx_median(total_amount) AS median
FROM my_namespace.sales_data
GROUP BY department
```

### approx\_distinct

Returns the approximate count of distinct values using HyperLogLog.

```sql
SELECT approx_distinct(customer_id) AS unique_customers
FROM my_namespace.sales_data

SELECT department, approx_distinct(customer_id) AS unique_customers
FROM my_namespace.sales_data
GROUP BY department
```

### approx\_top\_k

Returns the _k_ most frequent values with their approximate counts.

```sql
SELECT approx_top_k(department, 5) AS top_departments
FROM my_namespace.sales_data
```

## Collection aggregates

These aggregates accumulate all input values into a single result. Because they hold every value in memory, use a `WHERE` filter or `GROUP BY` to keep group sizes bounded on large datasets.

### array\_agg

```sql
SELECT department, array_agg(customer_id) AS customers
FROM my_namespace.sales_data

```

### string\_agg

```sql
SELECT department, string_agg(customer_id, ', ') AS customer_list
FROM my_namespace.sales_data
GROUP BY department
```
