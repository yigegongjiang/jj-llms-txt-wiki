## Error 10056: The add list items operation contains different types of list items

This error indicates that different types of list items were combined in a single add operation.

### Common causes

This error occurs when different types of list items (such as IP addresses, hostnames, and URL redirects) are included in a single operation to add items to a list. It can occur with an IP list, a hostname list, or a Bulk Redirect List.

### Resolution

Remove the list items that do not apply to the list type. This means:

* Removing IP addresses from a request to add items to a Bulk Redirect List.
* Removing URL redirects from a request to add items to an IP list.
