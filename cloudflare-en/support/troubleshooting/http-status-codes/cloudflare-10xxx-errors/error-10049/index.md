# Error 10049

## Error 10049: Invalid scheme in redirect source URL

This error indicates that the source URL's scheme is invalid.

### Common causes

This error occurs when the source URL of a URL redirect has an invalid scheme, which may be due to a misspelled or unsupported scheme or because the scheme is missing or improperly formatted.

### Resolution

Review the source URL and ensure that it uses one of the supported schemes: `http`, `https`, or empty (no scheme information, which means that it applies to both schemes). Refer to [Supported URL components in Bulk Redirects](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/url-forwarding/bulk-redirects/reference/url-components/) for details on the supported URL components for redirect source URLs.
