## Error 10058: List items incompatible with list type

This error indicates that incompatible items were added to the wrong list type.

### Common causes

This error occurs when you are adding items to a list (either IP list, hostname list, or Bulk Redirect List) and the list items are incompatible with the list type.

### Resolution

Make sure you are adding the items to the correct list:

* Custom lists with IP addresses (IP lists) can only contain IP addresses as list items.
* Custom lists with hostnames can only contain hostnames as list items.
* Bulk Redirect Lists can only contain URL redirects as list items.
