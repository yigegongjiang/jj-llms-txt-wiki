## Error 10053: Invalid redirect source URL with query string

This error indicates that the source URL contains an unsupported query string component.

### Common causes

This error occurs when the source URL of a URL redirect includes a query string component, which is not supported. Possible causes include copying a URL with query parameters, misconfiguration during setup, or attempting to redirect based on query parameters instead of the path.

### Resolution

Remove the query string from the redirect source URL. Refer to [Supported URL components in Bulk Redirects](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/url-forwarding/bulk-redirects/reference/url-components/) for details on the supported URL components for redirect source URLs.
