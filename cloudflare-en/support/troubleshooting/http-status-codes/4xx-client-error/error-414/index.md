# Error 414

Last updated Apr 23, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/support/troubleshooting/http-status-codes/4xx-client-error/error-414/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

## 414 URI Too Long

The `414 URI Too Long` status code indicates that the server refuses to process the request because the URI provided by the client is excessively long.

For more details, refer to [RFC 7231 ↗](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231).

### Common use cases

For example, if a client is attempting a `GET` request with an unusually long URI, such as one containing an excessive number of query parameters, after a `POST`, this could be seen as a security risk and a `414` is generated.

### Cloudflare-specific information

Cloudflare will generate a `414` response if the URI length exceeds 32KB.
