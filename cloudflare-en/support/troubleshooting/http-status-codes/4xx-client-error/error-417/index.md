# Error 417

Last updated Apr 23, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/support/troubleshooting/http-status-codes/4xx-client-error/error-417/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

## 417 Expectation Failed

The `417 Expectation Failed` status code indicates that the server could not meet the requirements specified in the `Expect` header of the client's request.

For more details, refer to [RFC 7231 ↗](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231).

### Common use cases

Some clients use the `Expect` header, such as `Expect: 100-continue`, to verify if the server is ready to receive a large payload, and if the server cannot fulfill this expectation, it returns a 417 response. Similarly, a server may reject a request with this error if the client includes an `Expect` header with unsupported or invalid values.

### Cloudflare-specific information

Cloudflare typically forwards this response from the origin server if it encounters an issue related to unsupported or unfulfilled `Expect` headers in the client's request.
