# Error 525

Last updated Jun 16, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/support/troubleshooting/http-status-codes/cloudflare-5xx-errors/error-525/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

## Error 525: SSL handshake failed

This error indicates that the SSL handshake between Cloudflare and the origin web server failed.

### Common causes

Error `525` occurs when these two conditions are true:

* The [SSL handshake ↗](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/what-happens-in-a-tls-handshake/) fails between Cloudflare and the origin web server.
* [_Full_ or _Full (Strict)_](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/origin-configuration/ssl-modes) **SSL** is set in the **Overview** tab of your Cloudflare **SSL/TLS** app.

Note

If your hosting provider frequently changes your origin web server's IP address, refer to Cloudflare's documentation on [dynamic DNS updates](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/manage-dns-records/how-to/managing-dynamic-ip-addresses).

### Resolution

Contact your hosting provider to exclude the following common causes at your origin web server:

* No valid SSL certificate is installed.
* Port `443` (or another custom secure port) is not open.
* No SNI support.
* The [cipher suites](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/origin-configuration/cipher-suites/) used by Cloudflare do not match the cipher suites supported by the origin web server.

Note

If `525` errors occur intermittently, review the origin web server error logs to determine the cause. Configure Apache to [log mod\_ssl errors ↗](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/HTTPD/DebuggingSSLProblems#Enable%5FSSL%5Flogging). Also, nginx includes SSL errors in its standard error log, but may possibly require [an increased log level ↗](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/monitoring/logging/).

* Verify that a certificate is installed on your origin server. For details on running tests, refer to [Troubleshoot requests with curl](https://developers.cloudflare.com/support/troubleshooting/general-troubleshooting/gathering-information-for-troubleshooting-sites/#troubleshoot-requests-with-curl). If no certificate is installed, you can generate and install a free [Cloudflare origin CA certificate](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/origin-configuration/origin-ca) to encrypt traffic between Cloudflare and your origin web server.
* [Review the cipher suites](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/edge-certificates/additional-options/cipher-suites/) used by your server to ensure they are compatible with Cloudflare.
* Check your server's error logs from the timestamps when `525` errors occur to identify any issues causing the connection to be reset during the SSL handshake.

### Diagnose with Origin Analytics

Use [Origin Analytics](https://developers.cloudflare.com/speed/origin-analytics/) to check whether SSL handshake failures are affecting specific endpoints. The **Origin status codes** chart shows when Cloudflare received no HTTP response from your origin (`originResponseStatus` of `0`), which can indicate TLS negotiation failures. Cross-reference these timestamps with your origin SSL error logs to pinpoint the cause.
