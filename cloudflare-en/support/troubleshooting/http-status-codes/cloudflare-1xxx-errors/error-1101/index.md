## Error 1101: Rendering error

This error indicates a rendering issue.

### Common cause

This error typically occurs when a Cloudflare Worker encounters a runtime JavaScript exception.

### Debugging

To identify the specific JavaScript exception:

1. Check your Workers logs in the Cloudflare dashboard under **Workers & Pages** \> **Your Worker** \> **Logs**.
2. Review the Workers code for potential runtime errors such as:  
  * Undefined variables or functions
  * Type errors
  * Promise rejections
  * Network request failures
3. Test the [Worker locally](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/local-development/#local-development) with sample requests to reproduce the error.
4. Refer to [Workers error handling](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/observability/errors/) for more details on debugging Workers.

### Resolution

Fix the JavaScript exception in your Workers code. If you need assistance, [provide appropriate issue details](https://developers.cloudflare.com/support/contacting-cloudflare-support/) to Cloudflare Support, including:

* The Ray ID from the error page
* The Worker name
* Recent changes to the Worker code
* Steps to reproduce the error
