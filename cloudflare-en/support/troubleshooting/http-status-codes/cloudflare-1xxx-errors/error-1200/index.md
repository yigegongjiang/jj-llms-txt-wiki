# Error 1200

## Error 1200: Cache connection limit

This error indicates that the number of requests queued on Cloudflare's edge exceeds the limit.

### Common cause

There are too many requests queued on Cloudflare's edge that are awaiting process by your origin web server. This limit protects Cloudflare's systems.

### Resolution

Tune your origin webserver to accept incoming connections faster. Adjust your caching settings to improve cache-hit rates so that fewer requests reach your origin web server. Reach out to your hosting provider or web administrator for assistance.
