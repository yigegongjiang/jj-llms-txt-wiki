# Error 1018

Last updated Apr 23, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/support/troubleshooting/http-status-codes/cloudflare-1xxx-errors/error-1018/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

## Error 1018: Could not find host

This error indicates that the host could not be found.

### Common causes

* The Cloudflare domain was recently activated and there is a delay propagating the domain's settings to the Cloudflare edge network.
* The Cloudflare domain was created via a Cloudflare partner (for example, a hosting provider) and the provider's DNS failed.

Note

Error 1018 is returned via a HTTP `409` response code.

### Resolution

Contact [Cloudflare Support](https://developers.cloudflare.com/support/contacting-cloudflare-support/) with the following details:

* Your domain name.
* A screenshot of the `1018` error including the [**Ray ID**](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/reference/cloudflare-ray-id/) mentioned in the error message.
* A [HAR file](https://developers.cloudflare.com/support/troubleshooting/general-troubleshooting/gathering-information-for-troubleshooting-sites/) captured while duplicating the error.
