# Error 1014

## Error 1014: CNAME Cross-User Banned

This error indicates that a CNAME record between domains in different Cloudflare accounts is prohibited.

### Common cause

By default, Cloudflare prohibits a DNS CNAME record between domains in different Cloudflare accounts. CNAME records are permitted within a domain (`www.example.com` CNAME to `api.example.com`) and across zones within the same user account (`www.example.com` CNAME to `www.example.net`) or using our [Cloudflare for SaaS ↗](https://www.cloudflare.com/saas/) solution.

Another common cause is connecting a custom domain to an R2 bucket, where the domain is an active zone with the [zone hold](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/account/account-security/zone-holds/) feature enabled or if the zone is banned.

### Resolution

* To allow CNAME record resolution to a domain in a different Cloudflare account, the domain owner of the CNAME target must use [Cloudflare for SaaS](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/).
* To allow connecting to a R2 bucket with a custom domain, disable the [zone hold](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/account/account-security/zone-holds/) feature on the custom domain target zone to resolve the 1014 error.
* To allow connections to an R2 bucket whose zone is banned:

  * First, check whether there is any [phishing report](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/reference/report-abuse/complaint-types/) for the hostname (and request a review if there is one).
  * Second, make sure that you have no unpaid invoice(s), as you will not be able to enable any new services until [any outstanding balance](https://developers.cloudflare.com/billing/manage/pay-invoices-overdue-balances/) is addressed. If this does not resolve the issue, contact your account team.
