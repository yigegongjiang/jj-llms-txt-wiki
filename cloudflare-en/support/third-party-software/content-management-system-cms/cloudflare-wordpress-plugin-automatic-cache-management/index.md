# Cloudflare WordPress Plugin Automatic Cache Management

Last updated Apr 23, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/support/third-party-software/content-management-system-cms/cloudflare-wordpress-plugin-automatic-cache-management/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

## Overview

The Cloudflare WordPress plugin contains a feature called Automatic Cache Management. When a user adds, edits, or deletes a post, page, attachment, or comment - any associated URLs are purged from the Cloudflare cache.

When you switch a theme or customise a theme within the WordPress admin panel, the cache will automatically be cleared too.

Automatic Cache Management uses native hooks built into WordPress. The Cloudflare WordPress plugin purges the following cache URLs:

* deleted\_post
* edit\_post
* delete\_attachment
* autoptimize\_action\_cachepurged (for compatibility with the Autoptimize WordPress plugin)
* switch\_theme
* customize\_save\_after
