# Billing

Last updated Apr 21, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/observability/billing/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

D1 exposes analytics to track billing metrics (rows read, rows written, and total storage) across all databases in your account.

The metrics displayed in the [Cloudflare dashboard ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) are sourced from Cloudflare's [GraphQL Analytics API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/analytics/graphql-api/). You can access the metrics [programmatically](https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/observability/metrics-analytics/#query-via-the-graphql-api) via GraphQL or HTTP client.

## View metrics in the dashboard

Total account billable usage analytics for D1 are available in the Cloudflare dashboard. To view current and past metrics for an account:

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Billing** page.  
[Go to **Billing** ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/billing)
2. Go to **Billable Usage**.

From here you can view charts of your account's D1 usage on a daily or month-to-date timeframe.

Note that billable usage history is stored for a maximum of 30 days.

## Billing Notifications

Usage-based billing notifications are available within the [Cloudflare dashboard ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com) for users looking to monitor their total account usage.

Notifications on the following metrics are available:

* Rows Read
* Rows Written
