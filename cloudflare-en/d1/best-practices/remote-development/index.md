# Remote development

Last updated Apr 21, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/best-practices/remote-development/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

D1 supports remote development using the [dashboard playground](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/playground/#use-the-playground). The dashboard playground uses a browser version of Visual Studio Code, allowing you to rapidly iterate on your Worker entirely in your browser.

## 1\. Bind a D1 database to a Worker

Note

This guide assumes you have previously created a Worker, and a D1 database.

Users new to D1 and/or Cloudflare Workers should read the [D1 tutorial](https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/get-started/) to install `wrangler` and deploy their first database.

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Workers & Pages** page.  
[Go to **Workers & Pages** ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/workers-and-pages)
2. Select an existing Worker.
3. Go to the **Bindings** tab.
4. Select **Add binding**.
5. Select **D1 database** \> **Add binding**.
6. Enter a variable name, such as `DB`, and select the D1 database you wish to access from this Worker.
7. Select **Add binding**.

## 2\. Start a remote development session

1. On the Worker's page on the Cloudflare dashboard, select **Edit Code** at the top of the page.
2. Your Worker now has access to D1.

Use the following Worker script to verify that the Worker has access to the bound D1 database:

```js
export default {
  async fetch(request, env, ctx) {
    const res = await env.DB.prepare("SELECT 1;").run();
    return new Response(JSON.stringify(res, null, 2));
  },
};
```
