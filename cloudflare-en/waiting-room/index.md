# Cloudflare Waiting Room

Last updated Apr 16, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waiting-room/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

A virtual waiting room to manage peak traffic.

Business and above

Cloudflare Waiting Room allows you to route excess users of your website to a customized waiting room, helping preserve customer experience and protect origin servers from being overwhelmed with requests.

---

## Benefits

Waiting Room protects your origin server by preventing surges in legitimate traffic that may overload your origin.

Waiting Room also benefits your visitors by:

* Keeping your application online and preventing them from reaching error pages.
* Showing estimated wait times that are continuously updated.
* Opening up new spots more quickly by tracking dynamic inflow and [outflow](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waiting-room/reference/configuration-settings/#session-duration).
* Remembering each visitor's status to prevent someone from losing their place in line or having to re-queue if they leave your site.
* Appearing in your own [branding and style](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waiting-room/how-to/customize-waiting-room/), which enhances trust and lets you provide additional information as needed.
