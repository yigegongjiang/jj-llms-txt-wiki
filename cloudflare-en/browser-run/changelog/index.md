## 2026-07-28

**Structured handoff for Human in the Loop**
* [Human in the Loop](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-run/features/human-in-the-loop/) now supports structured handoff using Cloudflare-specific CDP commands. Your script calls `Cloudflare.handoff` with instructions for the human operator and waits for a `Cloudflare.handoffComplete` event, replacing the need to manually poll for completion. Refer to the [Human in the Loop documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-run/features/human-in-the-loop/) for examples and best practices.

## 2026-07-07

**New endpoint: /accessibilityTree**
* Added the [/accessibilityTree endpoint](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-run/quick-actions/accessibility-tree-endpoint/) to capture the accessibility tree from a rendered webpage. The accessibility tree includes roles, names, values, states, and hierarchy, giving AI agents and automation workflows a structured view of page elements without parsing raw HTML or interpreting screenshots. You can capture the full page tree, return only semantically meaningful nodes with `interestingOnly`, or capture a subtree with `root`.

## 2026-06-12

**New tutorial: Pre-render pages for crawlers**
* Added a new tutorial on how to [pre-render JavaScript-heavy pages](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-run/how-to/pre-render-pages/) using Browser Run and a Worker. The tutorial covers building a pre-rendering endpoint that calls the [/content Quick Action](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-run/quick-actions/content-endpoint/) to render pages in managed headless Chrome and return crawler-ready HTML for search crawlers, social preview bots, AI indexing jobs, or partner integrations.

## 2026-06-11

**New formats parameter for /snapshot**
* The [/snapshot endpoint](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-run/quick-actions/snapshot/) now supports a `formats` parameter that lets you return multiple page formats in a single API call. Previously, `/snapshot` returned only HTML content and a screenshot. You can now also include Markdown and the accessibility tree in the same response. Refer to the [/snapshot documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-run/quick-actions/snapshot/) for usage examples and accepted values.

## 2026-05-28

**Use Quick Actions directly from Workers**
* You can now call [Quick Actions](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-run/quick-actions/) directly from a [Worker](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/) using the `quickAction()` method on the [browser binding](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-run/reference/wrangler/#bindings). This removes the need for API tokens or external HTTP requests when using Quick Actions within Workers. Supported actions include [screenshot](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-run/quick-actions/screenshot-endpoint/), [PDF](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-run/quick-actions/pdf-endpoint/), [content](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-run/quick-actions/content-endpoint/), [markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-run/quick-actions/markdown-endpoint/), [JSON](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-run/quick-actions/json-endpoint/), [scrape](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-run/quick-actions/scrape-endpoint/), [links](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-run/quick-actions/links-endpoint/), and [snapshot](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-run/quick-actions/snapshot/). The `quickAction()` method requires a compatibility date of `2026-03-24` or later.

## 2026-04-15

**@cloudflare/playwright v1.3.0 released**
* Released version 1.3.0 of [@cloudflare/playwright](https://github.com/cloudflare/playwright/releases/tag/v1.3.0). Starting with this version, the library uses the standard CDP (Chrome DevTools Protocol) internally to communicate with Browser Run, replacing the previous chunked protocol. This aligns with Browser Run's [full CDP support](https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/post/2026-04-10-browser-rendering-cdp-endpoint/) and prevents compatibility issues when using the latest compatibility dates. If you encounter any issues, you can downgrade by setting a `compatibility_date` prior to `2026-03-17` or by adding the `no_websocket_standard_binary_type` flag. Refer to the [@cloudflare/playwright README](https://github.com/cloudflare/playwright?tab=readme-ov-file#cdp-protocol-support) for details.

## 2026-04-15

**Higher concurrency limits**
* Increased the default [concurrent browser limit](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-run/limits/#workers-paid) for Workers Paid plans from 30 to **120 per account**.
* Increased new browser instance rate for Workers Paid plans from 30 per minute to **1 per second**.
* Rate limits across the [limits page](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-run/limits/) are now expressed in per-second terms, matching how they are enforced.

## 2026-04-15

**Live View**
* [Live View](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-run/features/live-view/) lets you see and interact with a remote browser session in real time. Use it to debug automation scripts, monitor what a browser is doing, or manually step in when a task requires human intervention. Access Live View from the Cloudflare dashboard, via the hosted UI at `live.browser.run`, or using native Chrome DevTools.

## 2026-04-15

**Human in the Loop**
* [Human in the Loop](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-run/features/human-in-the-loop/) lets a human step into a live browser session to handle what automation cannot, such as login pages, CAPTCHAs, or sensitive data entry, then hand control back to the script. Access any active session through [Live View](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-run/features/live-view/).

## 2026-04-15

**Session Recordings**
* [Session Recordings](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-run/features/session-recording/) captures DOM changes, mouse and keyboard events, and page navigation as structured data so you can replay any browser session after it ends. Enable recordings by passing `recording: true` when launching a browser. After the session closes, access recordings from the **Runs** tab in the Cloudflare dashboard or retrieve them via API.

## 2026-04-15

**WebMCP support**
* Browser Run now supports [WebMCP](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-run/features/webmcp/) (Web Model Context Protocol), which allows websites to declare structured tools that AI agents can discover and execute. WebMCP-enabled browsers are available through the experimental lab browser pool.

## 2026-04-14

**Wrangler CLI commands for Browser Rendering**
* Added `wrangler browser` commands to create, manage, and view browser sessions directly from the terminal. Available commands: `create`, `close`, `list`, and `view`. For full usage details, refer to [Wrangler commands](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-run/reference/wrangler-commands/).

## 2026-04-13

**@cloudflare/puppeteer v1.1.0 released**
* Released version 1.1.0 of [@cloudflare/puppeteer](https://github.com/cloudflare/puppeteer/releases/tag/v1.1.0), which replaces the internal chunked protocol with plain CDP. This fixes a compatibility issue when using the latest compatibility dates.

## 2026-04-10

**Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP) and MCP client support**
* Browser Rendering now exposes the [Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP)](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-run/cdp/) as an endpoint. Any CDP-compatible client, including [Puppeteer](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-run/cdp/puppeteer/) and [Playwright](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-run/cdp/playwright/), can connect from any environment, whether that is [Cloudflare Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/), your local machine, or a cloud environment. [MCP clients](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-run/cdp/mcp-clients/) like Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cursor, and OpenCode can also use Browser Rendering as their remote browser.

## 2026-04-06

**Local development: headful mode (experimental)**
* You can now run Chrome in visible (headful) mode during local development by setting `X_BROWSER_HEADFUL=true` before running `wrangler dev` or `vite dev`. This makes it easier to visually debug your browser automation scripts. This feature is experimental and may change without notice.

## 2026-03-23

**@cloudflare/playwright v1.2.0 released**
* Released version 1.2.0 of [@cloudflare/playwright](https://github.com/cloudflare/playwright/releases/tag/v1.2.0), now upgraded to [Playwright v1.58.2](https://playwright.dev/docs/release-notes#version-158).

## 2026-03-17

**Separate bot detection IDs for Browser Rendering methods**
* Browser Rendering now uses separate bot detection IDs for the [REST API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-run/quick-actions/) and [Browser Sessions](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-run/#integration-methods) versus the [crawl endpoint](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-run/quick-actions/crawl-endpoint/), allowing you to identify and control each method independently. For the full list of IDs, refer to [Automatic request headers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-run/reference/automatic-request-headers/#bot-detection).

## 2026-03-10

**New REST API endpoint: /crawl (Beta)**
* Added the [/crawl endpoint](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-run/quick-actions/crawl-endpoint/) (beta) to the REST API. The `/crawl` endpoint scrapes content from a starting URL and follows links across the site, up to a configurable depth or page limit. Responses can be returned as HTML, Markdown, or structured JSON (powered by [Workers AI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/)).

## 2026-03-04

**Increased REST API rate limits**
* Increased [REST API rate limits](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-run/limits/#workers-paid) for Workers Paid plans from 180 requests per minute (3 per second) to 600 requests per minute (10 per second). No action is needed to benefit from the higher limits.

## 2026-02-26

**New tutorial: Generate OG images for Astro sites**
* Added a new tutorial on how to [generate OG images for Astro sites](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-run/how-to/og-images-astro/) using Browser Rendering. The tutorial walks through creating an Astro template, using Browser Rendering to screenshot it as a PNG, and serving the generated images.

## 2026-02-24

**Documentation updates for robots.txt and sitemaps**
* Added [robots.txt and sitemaps reference page](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-run/reference/robots-txt/) with guidance on configuring robots.txt and sitemaps for sites accessed by Browser Rendering, including sitemap index files and caching headers.
