# Browser Run

Last updated Aug 11, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-run/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Run headless Chrome on [Cloudflare's global network](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/) for browser automation, web scraping, testing, and content generation.

Available on Free and Paid plans

Browser Run, formerly known as Browser Rendering, enables developers to programmatically control and interact with headless browser instances running on Cloudflare’s global network.

## Use cases

Programmatically load and fully render dynamic webpages or raw HTML and capture specific outputs such as:

* [Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-run/quick-actions/markdown-endpoint/)
* [Screenshots](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-run/quick-actions/screenshot-endpoint/)
* [PDFs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-run/quick-actions/pdf-endpoint/)
* [Snapshots](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-run/quick-actions/snapshot/)
* [Links](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-run/quick-actions/links-endpoint/)
* [HTML elements](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-run/quick-actions/scrape-endpoint/)
* [Structured data](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-run/quick-actions/json-endpoint/)
* [Crawled web content](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-run/quick-actions/crawl-endpoint/)

## Integration methods

Browser Run offers two categories of integration methods:

* **[Quick Actions](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-run/quick-actions/)**: Simple, stateless browser tasks like screenshots, PDFs, and scraping. No code deployment needed.
* **Browser Sessions**: Direct browser control via [Puppeteer](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-run/puppeteer/), [Playwright](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-run/playwright/), [CDP](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-run/cdp/), or [Stagehand](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-run/stagehand/). Deploy within Cloudflare Workers or connect from any environment via CDP.

## Key features

* **Scale to thousands of browsers**: Instant access to a global pool of browsers with low cold-start time, ideal for high-volume screenshot generation, data extraction, or automation at scale
* **Global by default**: Browser sessions run on Cloudflare's edge network, opening close to your users for better speed and availability worldwide
* **Easy to integrate**: [Quick Actions](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-run/quick-actions/) for common tasks, [Puppeteer](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-run/puppeteer/) and [Playwright](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-run/playwright/) for complex workflows, and [CDP](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-run/cdp/) for direct browser control from any environment
* **Session management**: [Reuse browser sessions](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-run/features/reuse-sessions/) across requests to improve performance and reduce cold-start overhead
* **Flexible pricing**: Pay only for browser time used with generous free tier ([view pricing](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-run/pricing/))
