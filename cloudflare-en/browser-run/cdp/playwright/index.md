# Using with Playwright (CDP)

Last updated May 28, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-run/cdp/playwright/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

You can use [Playwright ↗](https://playwright.dev/) to connect to Browser Run sessions from any Node.js environment and automate browser tasks programmatically via CDP. This is useful for scripts running on your local machine, CI/CD pipelines, or external servers.

Before you begin, [create a custom API Token](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/get-started/create-token/) with `Browser Rendering - Edit` permission.

## Prerequisites

* Node.js installed on your machine
* A Cloudflare account with Browser Run enabled
* A Browser Run API token with `Browser Rendering - Edit` permissions

## Install Playwright

Install the `playwright-core` package (the version without bundled browsers):

npmyarnpnpmbun

```
npm i playwright-core
```

```
yarn add playwright-core
```

```
pnpm add playwright-core
```

```
bun add playwright-core
```

## Connect to Browser Run

The following script demonstrates how to connect to a Browser Run session, navigate to a page, extract the title, and take a screenshot.

Create a file named `script.js`:

```js
const { chromium } = require("playwright-core");

const ACCOUNT_ID = process.env.CF_ACCOUNT_ID || "<ACCOUNT_ID>";
const API_TOKEN = process.env.CF_API_TOKEN || "<API_TOKEN>";

const browserWSEndpoint = `wss://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/${ACCOUNT_ID}/browser-rendering/devtools/browser?keep_alive=600000`;

async function main() {
	const browser = await chromium.connectOverCDP(browserWSEndpoint, {
		headers: {
			Authorization: `Bearer ${API_TOKEN}`,
		},
	});

	const context = browser.contexts()[0];
	const page = context.pages()[0] || (await context.newPage());
	await page.goto("https://developers.cloudflare.com");

	const title = await page.title();
	console.log(`Page title: ${title}`);

	await page.screenshot({ path: "screenshot.png" });

	await browser.close();
}

main().catch(console.error);
```

Replace `ACCOUNT_ID` with your Cloudflare account ID and `API_TOKEN` with your Browser Run API token, or set them as environment variables:

```bash
export CF_ACCOUNT_ID="<ACCOUNT_ID>"
export CF_API_TOKEN="<API_TOKEN>"
```

## Run the script

```bash
node script.js
```

You should see the page title printed to the console and a screenshot saved as `screenshot.png`.

## How it works

The script connects directly to Browser Run via WebSocket using the CDP protocol:

1. **WebSocket endpoint** \- The `browserWSEndpoint` URL acquires a new browser session and connects to it via WebSocket
2. **Authentication** \- The `Authorization` header with your API token authenticates the request
3. **Keep-alive** \- The `keep_alive` parameter (in milliseconds) specifies how long the session stays active
4. **Playwright API** \- Once connected, you use the standard Playwright API to control the browser
