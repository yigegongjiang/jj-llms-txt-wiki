This guide walks you through creating an AI Search instance using the Cloudflare dashboard.

## Create an AI Search instance

1. Go to **AI Search** in the Cloudflare dashboard.  
[Go to **AI Search** ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/ai/ai-search)
2. Select **Create Instance**.
3. Name your AI Search instance.
4. Optionally connect a [data source](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-search/configuration/data-source/) such as a website you own or an R2 bucket.
5. Review your configurations.
6. Select **Create**.

## Upload content

Once an instance has been created, you can upload files directly from the dashboard.

1. Go to **AI Search** in the Cloudflare dashboard.  
[Go to **AI Search** ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/ai/ai-search)
2. Select your instance.
3. Select the **Items** tab.
4. Upload your files. AI Search indexes them automatically.

## Try it out

Once your content is indexed, you can run your first query.

1. Go to your AI Search instance.
2. Select the **Playground** tab.
3. Select **Chat** or **Search**.
4. Enter a query to test the response.

## Add to your application

There are multiple ways you can connect AI Search to your application:

### [Workers Binding](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-search/api/search/workers-binding/)

Query AI Search directly from your Workers code.

### [REST API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-search/api/search/rest-api/)

Query AI Search using HTTP requests.
