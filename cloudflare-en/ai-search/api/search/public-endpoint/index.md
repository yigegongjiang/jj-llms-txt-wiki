# Public endpoint

Last updated Apr 20, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-search/api/search/public-endpoint/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

AI Search public endpoints allow you to expose AI Search capabilities without requiring authentication. This enables you to integrate AI Search into public-facing applications or share it with external users.

For pre-built search and chat components you can embed on your website using the public endpoints, refer to [UI snippets](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-search/configuration/retrieval/embed-search-snippets/).

## Prerequisites

Enable public endpoints for your AI Search instance:

1. Go to **AI Search** in the Cloudflare dashboard. [Go to **AI Search** ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/ai/ai-search)
2. Select your AI Search instance.
3. Go to **Settings** \> **Public Endpoint**.
4. Turn on **Enable Public Endpoint**.
5. Copy the public endpoint URL.

For configuration options like rate limiting and CORS, refer to [Public endpoint configuration](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-search/configuration/retrieval/public-endpoint/).

## Chat completions

The `/chat/completions` endpoint searches your data source and generates a response using the model and retrieved context. It uses the same OpenAI-compatible format as the [REST API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-search/api/search/rest-api/#chat-completions).

```bash
curl https://<INSTANCE_ID>.search.ai.cloudflare.com/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [
      {
        "content": "How do I configure AI Search?",
        "role": "user"
      }
    ]
  }'
```

For the full list of options, refer to the [Chat Completions API reference](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/ai%5Fsearch/subresources/instances/methods/chat%5Fcompletions/).

## Search

The `/search` endpoint returns relevant chunks from your data source without generating a response. It uses the same format as the [REST API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-search/api/search/rest-api/#search).

```bash
curl https://<INSTANCE_ID>.search.ai.cloudflare.com/search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [
      {
        "content": "How do I configure AI Search?",
        "role": "user"
      }
    ]
  }'
```

For the full list of options, refer to the [Search API reference](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/ai%5Fsearch/subresources/instances/methods/search/).
