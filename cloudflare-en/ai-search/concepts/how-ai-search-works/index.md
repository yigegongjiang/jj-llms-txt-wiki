# How AI Search works

Last updated Jul 6, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-search/concepts/how-ai-search-works/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

AI Search is a managed search service. Connect a website, an R2 bucket, or upload your own documents, and AI Search indexes your content for natural language queries.

AI Search consists of two core processes:

* **Indexing:** An asynchronous process that converts your content into vectors and keyword indexes for search. Indexing runs automatically when you connect a data source or upload files.
* **Querying:** A synchronous process triggered by user queries. It retrieves the most relevant content using vector search, keyword search, or both, and optionally generates a response.

## How indexing works

Indexing begins automatically when you connect a data source or upload files through the [Items API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-search/api/items/workers-binding/).

Here is what happens during indexing:

1. **Data ingestion:** AI Search reads from your connected data source or receives files uploaded through the [Items API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-search/api/items/workers-binding/).
2. **Markdown conversion:** AI Search uses [Workers AI's Markdown Conversion](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/features/markdown-conversion/) to convert [supported data types](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-search/configuration/data-source/) into structured Markdown. This ensures consistency across diverse file types. For images, Workers AI is used to perform object detection followed by vision-to-language transformation to convert images into Markdown text. Refer to [how images are converted](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/features/markdown-conversion/how-it-works/#images) for details.
3. **Chunking:** The extracted text is [chunked](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-search/configuration/indexing/chunking/) into smaller pieces to improve retrieval granularity.
4. **Embedding:** Each chunk is embedded using Workers AI's embedding model to transform the content into vectors.
5. **Keyword indexing:** When keyword search is enabled, each chunk is also indexed for BM25 keyword matching.
6. **Storage:** The vectors, keyword index, and content are stored and ready for search.

For instances with a connected data source, AI Search regularly checks for updates and indexes changes automatically. For instances using [built-in storage](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-search/configuration/data-source/built-in-storage/), new files are indexed as they are uploaded.

## How querying works

Once indexing is complete, AI Search is ready to respond to end-user queries in real time.

Here is how the querying pipeline works:

1. **Receive query from AI Search API:** The query workflow begins when you send a request to either the AI Search's [Chat Completions](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-search/api/search/rest-api/#chat-completions) or [Search](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-search/api/search/rest-api/#search) endpoints.
2. **Query rewriting (optional):** AI Search provides the option to [rewrite the input query](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-search/configuration/retrieval/query-rewriting/) using one of Workers AI's LLMs to improve retrieval quality by transforming the original query into a more effective search query.
3. **Embedding the query:** The rewritten (or original) query is transformed into a vector using the same embedding model used to embed your data.
4. **Vector search:** The query vector is matched against stored vectors to find semantically similar content.
5. **Keyword search (optional):** When hybrid search is enabled, a BM25 keyword search runs in parallel with vector search.
6. **Fusion (optional):** When using hybrid search, vector and keyword results are combined using the configured fusion method.
7. **Reranking (optional):** A cross-encoder model re-scores results by evaluating the query and document together. Refer to [Reranking](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-search/configuration/retrieval/reranking/) for details.
8. **Content retrieval:** The most relevant chunks and their source content are returned. If you are using the Search endpoint, the content is returned at this point.
9. **Response generation:** If you are using the Chat Completions endpoint, a text-generation model generates a response using the retrieved content. Refer to [System prompt](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-search/configuration/retrieval/system-prompt/) for details.

## When to use AI Search vs. Vectorize

AI Search is built on [Vectorize](https://developers.cloudflare.com/vectorize/) and adds the rest of the search pipeline around it. Use Vectorize when you want to manage vectors yourself, and AI Search when you want managed search over your content.

| Capability              | AI Search                                                  | Vectorize                                        |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| What it is              | Managed, end-to-end search over your content               | A vector database you build on                   |
| You give it             | Files, or a connected data source                          | Vectors you generate yourself                    |
| Chunking and embeddings | Handled for you                                            | You generate and insert them                     |
| Indexing                | Automatic, with continuous sync                            | You upsert and manage vectors                    |
| Retrieval               | Vector and keyword (hybrid), reranking, metadata filtering | Vector similarity search with metadata filtering |
| Generated answers       | Optional, built in                                         | Not included                                     |
| Best when               | You want to add search or RAG quickly                      | You need full control of the retrieval pipeline  |
