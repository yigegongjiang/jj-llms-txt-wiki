# Pricing

Last updated Jun 18, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/platform/pricing/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Hyperdrive is included in both the Free and Paid [Workers plans](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/pricing/).

|                                         | Free plan[1](#user-content-fn-1) | Paid plan |
| --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | --------- |
| Database queries[2](#user-content-fn-2) | 100,000 / day                    | Unlimited |

Footnotes

1: The Workers Free plan includes limited Hyperdrive usage. All limits reset daily at 00:00 UTC. If you exceed any one of these limits, further operations of that type will fail with an error.

2: Database queries refers to any database statement made via Hyperdrive, whether a query (`SELECT`), a modification (`INSERT`,`UPDATE`, or `DELETE`) or a schema change (`CREATE`, `ALTER`, `DROP`).

Hyperdrive limits are automatically adjusted when subscribed to a Workers Paid plan. Hyperdrive's [connection pooling and query caching](https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/concepts/how-hyperdrive-works/) are included in Workers Paid plan, so do not incur any additional charges.

## PlanetScale Postgres & MySQL

You can create PlanetScale Postgres and MySQL databases from Cloudflare and bill PlanetScale database usage through your Cloudflare account as a pay-as-you-go customer.

PlanetScale database usage is separate from Hyperdrive usage. When you create a PlanetScale database from the Cloudflare dashboard, PlanetScale usage appears on your Cloudflare invoice each billing period as a dollar total at PlanetScale's standard [pricing ↗](https://planetscale.com/pricing).

You can view per-database billing usage in the [PlanetScale dashboard ↗](https://planetscale.com/docs/billing#organization-usage-and-billing-page). To learn how PlanetScale databases work with Workers and Hyperdrive, refer to [PlanetScale Postgres and MySQL with Hyperdrive](https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/planetscale/).
