## Supported database providers

Hyperdrive supports managed Postgres and MySQL databases provided by various providers, including AWS, Azure, and GCP. Refer to [Examples](https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/examples/connect-to-postgres/) to see how to connect to various database providers.

Hyperdrive also supports databases that are compatible with the Postgres or MySQL protocol. The following is a non-exhaustive list of Postgres or MySQL-compatible database providers:

## Supported TLS (SSL) modes

### PostgreSQL

Hyperdrive supports the following [PostgreSQL TLS (SSL) ↗](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-ssl.html) connection modes when connecting to your origin database:

| Mode        | Supported        | Details                                                                                                                                  |
| ----------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| none        | No               | Hyperdrive does not support insecure plain text connections.                                                                             |
| prefer      | No (use require) | Hyperdrive will always use TLS.                                                                                                          |
| require     | Yes (default)    | TLS is required, and server certificates are validated (based on WebPKI).                                                                |
| verify-ca   | Yes              | Verifies the server's TLS certificate is signed by a root CA on the client. This ensures the server has a certificate the client trusts. |
| verify-full | Yes              | Identical to verify-ca, but also requires the database hostname must match a Subject Alternative Name (SAN) present on the certificate.  |

### MySQL

Hyperdrive supports the following [MySQL TLS (SSL) ↗](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/connection-options.html#option%5Fgeneral%5Fssl-mode) connection modes when connecting to your origin database:

| Mode             | Supported         | Details                                                                                                                                                       |
| ---------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| DISABLED         | No                | Hyperdrive does not support insecure plain text connections.                                                                                                  |
| PREFERRED        | No (use REQUIRED) | Hyperdrive will always use TLS.                                                                                                                               |
| REQUIRED         | Yes (default)     | TLS is required, and server certificates are validated (based on WebPKI).                                                                                     |
| VERIFY\_CA       | Yes               | Verifies the server's TLS certificate is signed by a root CA on the client. This ensures the server has a certificate the client trusts.                      |
| VERIFY\_IDENTITY | Yes               | In addition to VERIFY\_CA checks, Hyperdrive requires the database hostname to match a Subject Alternative Name (SAN) or Common Name (CN) on the certificate. |

Refer to [SSL/TLS certificates](https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/configuration/tls-ssl-certificates-for-hyperdrive/) documentation for details on how to configure these TLS (SSL) modes for Hyperdrive.

## Supported PostgreSQL authentication modes

Hyperdrive supports the following [authentication modes ↗](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/auth-methods.html) for connecting to PostgreSQL databases:

* Password Authentication (`md5`)
* Password Authentication (`password`) (clear-text password)
* SASL Authentication (`SCRAM-SHA-256`)

## Unsupported PostgreSQL features:

Hyperdrive does not support the following PostgreSQL features:

* SQL-level management of prepared statements, such as using `PREPARE`, `DISCARD`, `DEALLOCATE`, or `EXECUTE`.
* Advisory locks ([PostgreSQL documentation ↗](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/explicit-locking.html#ADVISORY-LOCKS)).
* `LISTEN` and `NOTIFY`.
* `PREPARE` and `DEALLOCATE`.
* Any modification to per-session state not explicitly documented as supported elsewhere.

## Unsupported MySQL features:

Hyperdrive does not support the following MySQL features:

* Non-UTF8 characters in queries
* `USE` statements
* Multi-statement queries
* Prepared statement queries via SQL (using `PREPARE` and `EXECUTE` statements) and [protocol-level prepared statements ↗](https://sidorares.github.io/node-mysql2/docs/documentation/prepared-statements).
* `COM_INIT_DB` messages
* [Authentication plugins ↗](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/authentication-plugins.html) other than `caching_sha2_password` or `mysql_native_password`

In cases where you need to issue these unsupported statements from your application, the Hyperdrive team recommends setting up a second, direct client without Hyperdrive.
