# PlanetScale

Connect Hyperdrive to a PlanetScale MySQL database.

Last updated Apr 21, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/examples/connect-to-mysql/mysql-database-providers/planetscale/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

This example shows you how to connect Hyperdrive to a [PlanetScale ↗](https://planetscale.com/) MySQL database.

## 1\. Allow Hyperdrive access

You can connect Hyperdrive to any existing PlanetScale MySQL-compatible database by creating a new user and fetching your database connection string.

### PlanetScale Dashboard

1. Go to the [**PlanetScale dashboard** ↗](https://app.planetscale.com/) and select the database you wish to connect to.
2. Click **Connect**. Enter `hyperdrive-user` as the password name (or your preferred name) and configure the permissions as desired. Select **Create password**. Note the username and password as they will not be displayed again.
3. Select **Other** as your language or framework. Note down the database host, database name, database username, and password. You will need these to create a database configuration in Hyperdrive.

With the host, database name, username and password, you can now create a Hyperdrive database configuration.

Note

To reduce latency, use a [Placement Hint](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/placement/#configure-explicit-placement-hints) to run your Worker close to your PlanetScale database. This is especially useful when a single request makes multiple queries.

```jsonc
{
	"placement": {
		// Match to your PlanetScale region, for example "gcp:us-east4" or "aws:us-east-1"
		"region": "gcp:us-east4",
	},
}
```

## 2\. Create a database configuration

To configure Hyperdrive, you will need:

* The IP address (or hostname) and port of your database.
* The database username (for example, `hyperdrive-demo`) you configured in a previous step.
* The password associated with that username.
* The name of the database you want Hyperdrive to connect to. For example, `mysql`.

Hyperdrive accepts the combination of these parameters in the common connection string format used by database drivers:

```txt
mysql://USERNAME:PASSWORD@HOSTNAME_OR_IP_ADDRESS:PORT/database_name
```

Most database providers will provide a connection string you can copy-and-paste directly into Hyperdrive.

To create a Hyperdrive configuration with the [Wrangler CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/), open your terminal and run the following command.

* Replace <NAME\_OF\_HYPERDRIVE\_CONFIG> with a name for your Hyperdrive configuration and paste the connection string provided from your database host, or,
* Replace `user`, `password`, `HOSTNAME_OR_IP_ADDRESS`, `port`, and `database_name` placeholders with those specific to your database:

```sh
npx wrangler hyperdrive create <NAME_OF_HYPERDRIVE_CONFIG> --connection-string="mysql://user:password@HOSTNAME_OR_IP_ADDRESS:PORT/database_name"
```

Note

Hyperdrive will attempt to connect to your database with the provided credentials to verify they are correct before creating a configuration. If you encounter an error when attempting to connect, refer to Hyperdrive's [troubleshooting documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/observability/troubleshooting/) to debug possible causes.

This command outputs a binding for the [Wrangler configuration file](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/):

```jsonc
{
	"$schema": "./node_modules/wrangler/config-schema.json",
	"name": "hyperdrive-example",
	"main": "src/index.ts",
	// Set this to today's date
	"compatibility_date": "2026-08-25",
	"compatibility_flags": [
		"nodejs_compat"
	],
	// Pasted from the output of `wrangler hyperdrive create <NAME_OF_HYPERDRIVE_CONFIG> --connection-string=[...]` above.
	"hyperdrive": [
		{
			"binding": "HYPERDRIVE",
			"id": "<ID OF THE CREATED HYPERDRIVE CONFIGURATION>"
		}
	]
}
```

```toml
"$schema" = "./node_modules/wrangler/config-schema.json"
name = "hyperdrive-example"
main = "src/index.ts"
# Set this to today's date
compatibility_date = "2026-08-25"
compatibility_flags = [ "nodejs_compat" ]

[[hyperdrive]]
binding = "HYPERDRIVE"
id = "<ID OF THE CREATED HYPERDRIVE CONFIGURATION>"
```

## 3\. Use Hyperdrive from your Worker

Install the [mysql2 ↗](https://github.com/sidorares/node-mysql2) driver:

npmyarnpnpmbun

```
npm i mysql2@>3.13.0
```

```
yarn add mysql2@>3.13.0
```

```
pnpm add mysql2@>3.13.0
```

```
bun add mysql2@>3.13.0
```

Note

`mysql2` v3.13.0 or later is required

Add the required Node.js compatibility flags and Hyperdrive binding to your `wrangler.jsonc` file:

```jsonc
{
	// required for database drivers to function
	"compatibility_flags": [
		"nodejs_compat"
	],
	// Set this to today's date
	"compatibility_date": "2026-08-25",
	"hyperdrive": [
		{
			"binding": "HYPERDRIVE",
			"id": "<your-hyperdrive-id-here>"
		}
	]
}
```

```toml
compatibility_flags = [ "nodejs_compat" ]
# Set this to today's date
compatibility_date = "2026-08-25"

[[hyperdrive]]
binding = "HYPERDRIVE"
id = "<your-hyperdrive-id-here>"
```

Create a new `connection` instance and pass the Hyperdrive parameters:

```ts
// mysql2 v3.13.0 or later is required
import { createConnection } from "mysql2/promise";

export default {
	async fetch(request, env, ctx): Promise<Response> {
		// Create a new connection on each request. Hyperdrive maintains the underlying
		// database connection pool, so creating a new connection is fast.
		const connection = await createConnection({
			host: env.HYPERDRIVE.host,
			user: env.HYPERDRIVE.user,
			password: env.HYPERDRIVE.password,
			database: env.HYPERDRIVE.database,
			port: env.HYPERDRIVE.port,

			// Required to enable mysql2 compatibility for Workers
			disableEval: true,
		});

		try {
			// Sample query
			const [results, fields] = await connection.query("SHOW tables;");

			// Return result rows as JSON
			return Response.json({ results, fields });
		} catch (e) {
			console.error(e);
			return Response.json(
				{ error: e instanceof Error ? e.message : e },
				{ status: 500 },
			);
		}
	},
} satisfies ExportedHandler<Env>;
```

Note

The minimum version of `mysql2` required for Hyperdrive is `3.13.0`.

Note

When connecting to a PlanetScale database with Hyperdrive, you should use a driver like [node-postgres (pg)](https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/examples/connect-to-postgres/postgres-drivers-and-libraries/node-postgres/) or [Postgres.js](https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/examples/connect-to-postgres/postgres-drivers-and-libraries/postgres-js/) to connect directly to the underlying database instead of the [PlanetScale serverless driver ↗](https://planetscale.com/docs/tutorials/planetscale-serverless-driver). Hyperdrive is optimized for database access for Workers and will perform global connection pooling and fast query routing by connecting directly to your database.
