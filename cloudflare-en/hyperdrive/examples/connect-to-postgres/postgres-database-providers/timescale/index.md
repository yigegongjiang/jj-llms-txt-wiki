# Timescale

Connect Hyperdrive to a Timescale time-series database.

Last updated Apr 21, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/examples/connect-to-postgres/postgres-database-providers/timescale/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

This example shows you how to connect Hyperdrive to a [Timescale ↗](https://www.timescale.com/) time-series database. Timescale is built on PostgreSQL, and includes powerful time-series, event and analytics features.

You can learn more about Timescale by referring to their [Timescale services documentation ↗](https://docs.timescale.com/getting-started/latest/services/).

## 1\. Allow Hyperdrive access

You can connect Hyperdrive to any existing Timescale database by creating a new user and fetching your database connection string.

### Timescale Dashboard

Note

Similar to most services, Timescale requires you to reset the password associated with your database user if you do not have it stored securely. You should ensure that you do not break any existing clients if when you reset the password.

To retrieve your credentials and database endpoint in the [Timescale Console ↗](https://console.cloud.timescale.com/):

1. Select the service (database) you want Hyperdrive to connect to.
2. Expand **Connection info**.
3. Copy the **Service URL**. The Service URL is the connection string that Hyperdrive will use to connect. This string includes the database hostname, port number and database name.

If you do not have your password stored, you will need to select **Forgot your password?** and set a new **SCRAM** password. Save this password, as Timescale will only display it once.

You will end up with a connection string resembling the below:

```txt
postgres://tsdbadmin:YOUR_PASSWORD_HERE@pn79dztyy0.xzhhbfensb.tsdb.cloud.timescale.com:31358/tsdb
```

With the connection string, you can now create a Hyperdrive database configuration.

## 2\. Create a database configuration

To configure Hyperdrive, you will need:

* The IP address (or hostname) and port of your database.
* The database username (for example, `hyperdrive-demo`) you configured in a previous step.
* The password associated with that username.
* The name of the database you want Hyperdrive to connect to. For example, `postgres`.

Hyperdrive accepts the combination of these parameters in the common connection string format used by database drivers:

```txt
postgres://USERNAME:PASSWORD@HOSTNAME_OR_IP_ADDRESS:PORT/database_name
```

Most database providers will provide a connection string you can directly copy-and-paste directly into Hyperdrive.

To create a Hyperdrive configuration with the Cloudflare dashboard:

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Hyperdrive** page.  
[Go to **Hyperdrive** ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/workers/hyperdrive)
2. Select **Create Configuration**.
3. Fill out the form, including the connection string.
4. Select **Create**.

To create a Hyperdrive configuration with the [Wrangler CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/):

1. Open your terminal and run the following command. Replace `<NAME_OF_HYPERDRIVE_CONFIG>` with a name for your Hyperdrive configuration and paste the connection string provided from your database host, or replace `user`, `password`, `HOSTNAME_OR_IP_ADDRESS`, `port`, and `database_name` placeholders with those specific to your database:  
```sh  
npx wrangler hyperdrive create <NAME_OF_HYPERDRIVE_CONFIG> --connection-string="postgres://user:password@HOSTNAME_OR_IP_ADDRESS:PORT/database_name"  
```
2. This command outputs a binding for the [Wrangler configuration file](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/):  
```jsonc  
{  
	"$schema": "./node_modules/wrangler/config-schema.json",  
	"name": "hyperdrive-example",  
	"main": "src/index.ts",  
	// Set this to today's date  
	"compatibility_date": "2026-08-28",  
	"compatibility_flags": [  
		"nodejs_compat"  
	],  
	// Pasted from the output of `wrangler hyperdrive create <NAME_OF_HYPERDRIVE_CONFIG> --connection-string=[...]` above.  
	"hyperdrive": [  
		{  
			"binding": "HYPERDRIVE",  
			"id": "<ID OF THE CREATED HYPERDRIVE CONFIGURATION>"  
		}  
	]  
}  
```  
```toml  
"$schema" = "./node_modules/wrangler/config-schema.json"  
name = "hyperdrive-example"  
main = "src/index.ts"  
# Set this to today's date  
compatibility_date = "2026-08-28"  
compatibility_flags = [ "nodejs_compat" ]  
[[hyperdrive]]  
binding = "HYPERDRIVE"  
id = "<ID OF THE CREATED HYPERDRIVE CONFIGURATION>"  
```

Note

Hyperdrive will attempt to connect to your database with the provided credentials to verify they are correct before creating a configuration. If you encounter an error when attempting to connect, refer to Hyperdrive's [troubleshooting documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/observability/troubleshooting/) to debug possible causes.

## 3\. Use Hyperdrive from your Worker

Install the `node-postgres` driver:

npmyarnpnpmbun

```
npm i pg@>8.16.3
```

```
yarn add pg@>8.16.3
```

```
pnpm add pg@>8.16.3
```

```
bun add pg@>8.16.3
```

Note

The minimum version of `node-postgres` required for Hyperdrive is `8.16.3`.

If using TypeScript, install the types package:

npmyarnpnpmbun

```
npm i -D @types/pg
```

```
yarn add -D @types/pg
```

```
pnpm add -D @types/pg
```

```
bun add -d @types/pg
```

Add the required Node.js compatibility flags and Hyperdrive binding to your `wrangler.jsonc` file:

```jsonc
{
	// required for database drivers to function
	"compatibility_flags": [
		"nodejs_compat"
	],
	// Set this to today's date
	"compatibility_date": "2026-08-28",
	"hyperdrive": [
		{
			"binding": "HYPERDRIVE",
			"id": "<your-hyperdrive-id-here>"
		}
	]
}
```

```toml
compatibility_flags = [ "nodejs_compat" ]
# Set this to today's date
compatibility_date = "2026-08-28"

[[hyperdrive]]
binding = "HYPERDRIVE"
id = "<your-hyperdrive-id-here>"
```

Create a new `Client` instance and pass the Hyperdrive `connectionString`:

```ts
// filepath: src/index.ts
import { Client } from "pg";

export default {
	async fetch(
		request: Request,
		env: Env,
		ctx: ExecutionContext,
	): Promise<Response> {
		// Create a new client instance for each request. Hyperdrive maintains the
		// underlying database connection pool, so creating a new client is fast.
		const client = new Client({
			connectionString: env.HYPERDRIVE.connectionString,
		});

		try {
			// Connect to the database
			await client.connect();

			// Perform a simple query
			const result = await client.query("SELECT * FROM pg_tables");

			return Response.json({
				success: true,
				result: result.rows,
			});
		} catch (error: any) {
			console.error("Database error:", error.message);

			return new Response("Internal error occurred", { status: 500 });
		}
	},
};
```
