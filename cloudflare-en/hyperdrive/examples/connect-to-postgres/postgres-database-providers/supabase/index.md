# Supabase

Connect Hyperdrive to a Supabase Postgres database.

Last updated Apr 21, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/examples/connect-to-postgres/postgres-database-providers/supabase/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

This example shows you how to connect Hyperdrive to a [Supabase ↗](https://supabase.com/) Postgres database.

## 1\. Allow Hyperdrive access

You can connect Hyperdrive to any existing Supabase database as the Postgres user which is set up during project creation. Alternatively, to create a new user for Hyperdrive, run these commands in the [SQL Editor ↗](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/%5F/sql/new).

```sql
CREATE ROLE hyperdrive_user LOGIN PASSWORD 'sufficientlyRandomPassword';

-- Here, you are granting it the postgres role. In practice, you want to create a role with lesser privileges.
GRANT postgres to hyperdrive_user;
```

The database endpoint can be found in the [database settings page ↗](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/%5F/settings/database).

With a database user, password, database endpoint (hostname and port) and database name (default: postgres), you can now set up Hyperdrive.

Note

When connecting to Supabase from Hyperdrive, you should use the **Direct connection** connection string rather than the pooled connection strings. Hyperdrive will perform pooling of connections to ensure optimal access from Workers.

## 2\. Create a database configuration

To configure Hyperdrive, you will need:

* The IP address (or hostname) and port of your database.
* The database username (for example, `hyperdrive-demo`) you configured in a previous step.
* The password associated with that username.
* The name of the database you want Hyperdrive to connect to. For example, `postgres`.

Hyperdrive accepts the combination of these parameters in the common connection string format used by database drivers:

```txt
postgres://USERNAME:PASSWORD@HOSTNAME_OR_IP_ADDRESS:PORT/database_name
```

Most database providers will provide a connection string you can directly copy-and-paste directly into Hyperdrive.

To create a Hyperdrive configuration with the Cloudflare dashboard:

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Hyperdrive** page.  
[Go to **Hyperdrive** ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/workers/hyperdrive)
2. Select **Create Configuration**.
3. Fill out the form, including the connection string.
4. Select **Create**.

To create a Hyperdrive configuration with the [Wrangler CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/):

1. Open your terminal and run the following command. Replace `<NAME_OF_HYPERDRIVE_CONFIG>` with a name for your Hyperdrive configuration and paste the connection string provided from your database host, or replace `user`, `password`, `HOSTNAME_OR_IP_ADDRESS`, `port`, and `database_name` placeholders with those specific to your database:  
```sh  
npx wrangler hyperdrive create <NAME_OF_HYPERDRIVE_CONFIG> --connection-string="postgres://user:password@HOSTNAME_OR_IP_ADDRESS:PORT/database_name"  
```
2. This command outputs a binding for the [Wrangler configuration file](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/):  
```jsonc  
{  
	"$schema": "./node_modules/wrangler/config-schema.json",  
	"name": "hyperdrive-example",  
	"main": "src/index.ts",  
	// Set this to today's date  
	"compatibility_date": "2026-08-14",  
	"compatibility_flags": [  
		"nodejs_compat"  
	],  
	// Pasted from the output of `wrangler hyperdrive create <NAME_OF_HYPERDRIVE_CONFIG> --connection-string=[...]` above.  
	"hyperdrive": [  
		{  
			"binding": "HYPERDRIVE",  
			"id": "<ID OF THE CREATED HYPERDRIVE CONFIGURATION>"  
		}  
	]  
}  
```  
```toml  
"$schema" = "./node_modules/wrangler/config-schema.json"  
name = "hyperdrive-example"  
main = "src/index.ts"  
# Set this to today's date  
compatibility_date = "2026-08-14"  
compatibility_flags = [ "nodejs_compat" ]  
[[hyperdrive]]  
binding = "HYPERDRIVE"  
id = "<ID OF THE CREATED HYPERDRIVE CONFIGURATION>"  
```

Note

Hyperdrive will attempt to connect to your database with the provided credentials to verify they are correct before creating a configuration. If you encounter an error when attempting to connect, refer to Hyperdrive's [troubleshooting documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/observability/troubleshooting/) to debug possible causes.

## 3\. Use Hyperdrive from your Worker

Install the `node-postgres` driver:

npmyarnpnpmbun

```
npm i pg@>8.16.3
```

```
yarn add pg@>8.16.3
```

```
pnpm add pg@>8.16.3
```

```
bun add pg@>8.16.3
```

Note

The minimum version of `node-postgres` required for Hyperdrive is `8.16.3`.

If using TypeScript, install the types package:

npmyarnpnpmbun

```
npm i -D @types/pg
```

```
yarn add -D @types/pg
```

```
pnpm add -D @types/pg
```

```
bun add -d @types/pg
```

Add the required Node.js compatibility flags and Hyperdrive binding to your `wrangler.jsonc` file:

```jsonc
{
	// required for database drivers to function
	"compatibility_flags": [
		"nodejs_compat"
	],
	// Set this to today's date
	"compatibility_date": "2026-08-14",
	"hyperdrive": [
		{
			"binding": "HYPERDRIVE",
			"id": "<your-hyperdrive-id-here>"
		}
	]
}
```

```toml
compatibility_flags = [ "nodejs_compat" ]
# Set this to today's date
compatibility_date = "2026-08-14"

[[hyperdrive]]
binding = "HYPERDRIVE"
id = "<your-hyperdrive-id-here>"
```

Create a new `Client` instance and pass the Hyperdrive `connectionString`:

```ts
// filepath: src/index.ts
import { Client } from "pg";

export default {
	async fetch(
		request: Request,
		env: Env,
		ctx: ExecutionContext,
	): Promise<Response> {
		// Create a new client instance for each request. Hyperdrive maintains the
		// underlying database connection pool, so creating a new client is fast.
		const client = new Client({
			connectionString: env.HYPERDRIVE.connectionString,
		});

		try {
			// Connect to the database
			await client.connect();

			// Perform a simple query
			const result = await client.query("SELECT * FROM pg_tables");

			return Response.json({
				success: true,
				result: result.rows,
			});
		} catch (error: any) {
			console.error("Database error:", error.message);

			return new Response("Internal error occurred", { status: 500 });
		}
	},
};
```

Note

When connecting to a Supabase database with Hyperdrive, you should use a driver like [node-postgres (pg)](https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/examples/connect-to-postgres/postgres-drivers-and-libraries/node-postgres/) or [Postgres.js](https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/examples/connect-to-postgres/postgres-drivers-and-libraries/postgres-js/) to connect directly to the underlying database instead of the [Supabase JavaScript client ↗](https://github.com/supabase/supabase-js). Hyperdrive is optimized for database access for Workers and will perform global connection pooling and fast query routing by connecting directly to your database.
