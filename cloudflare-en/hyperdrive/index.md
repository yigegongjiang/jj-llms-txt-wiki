# Hyperdrive (Postgres & MySQL)

Last updated Jun 22, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Turn your existing regional database into a globally distributed database.

Available on Free and Paid plans

Hyperdrive is a service that accelerates queries you make to existing databases, making it faster to access your data from across the globe from [Cloudflare Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/), irrespective of your users' location.

Hyperdrive supports any Postgres or MySQL database, including those hosted on AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, Neon and PlanetScale. Hyperdrive also supports Postgres-compatible databases like CockroachDB and Timescale. You do not need to write new code or replace your favorite tools: Hyperdrive works with your existing code and tools you use.

Use Hyperdrive's connection details from your Cloudflare Workers application with your existing database drivers and object-relational mapping (ORM) libraries.

## Examples

### PostgreSQL

```ts
import { Client } from "pg";

export default {
	async fetch(request, env, ctx): Promise<Response> {
		// Create a new client instance for each request. Hyperdrive maintains the
		// underlying database connection pool, so creating a new client is fast.
		const client = new Client({
			connectionString: env.HYPERDRIVE.connectionString,
		});

		try {
			// Connect to the database
			await client.connect();
			// Sample SQL query
			const result = await client.query("SELECT * FROM pg_tables");

			return Response.json(result.rows);
		} catch (e) {
			return Response.json({ error: e instanceof Error ? e.message : e }, { status: 500 });
		}
	},
} satisfies ExportedHandler<{ HYPERDRIVE: Hyperdrive }>;
```

```json
	{
		"$schema": "node_modules/wrangler/config-schema.json",
		"name": "WORKER-NAME",
		"main": "src/index.ts",
		"compatibility_date": "2025-02-04",
		"compatibility_flags": [
			"nodejs_compat"
		],
		"observability": {
			"enabled": true
		},
		"hyperdrive": [
			{
				"binding": "HYPERDRIVE",
				"id": "<YOUR_HYPERDRIVE_ID>",
				"localConnectionString": "<ENTER_LOCAL_CONNECTION_STRING_FOR_LOCAL_DEVELOPMENT_HERE>"
			}
		]
	}
```

### MySQL

```ts
import { createConnection } from 'mysql2/promise';

export default {
  async fetch(request, env, ctx): Promise<Response> {
    // Create a new connection on each request. Hyperdrive maintains the
    // underlying database connection pool, so creating a new client is fast.
    const connection = await createConnection({
		 host: env.HYPERDRIVE.host,
		 user: env.HYPERDRIVE.user,
		 password: env.HYPERDRIVE.password,
		 database: env.HYPERDRIVE.database,
		 port: env.HYPERDRIVE.port,

     // This is needed to use mysql2 with Workers
     // This configures mysql2 to use static parsing instead of eval() parsing (not available on Workers)
     disableEval: true
  });

  const [results, fields] = await connection.query('SHOW tables;');

  return new Response(JSON.stringify({ results, fields }), {
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '\*',
    },
  });
}} satisfies ExportedHandler<{ HYPERDRIVE: Hyperdrive }>;
```
