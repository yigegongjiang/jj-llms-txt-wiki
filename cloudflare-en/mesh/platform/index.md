# Platform

Last updated Sep 16, 2026|Copy as Markdown| [View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/mesh/platform/index.md)| [Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Cloudflare Mesh is available in beta to Cloudflare One accounts, including accounts on the Free plan.

## Platform requirements

- Mesh nodes require a [supported Linux distribution](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/cloudflare-one-client/download/#linux) or the [`cloudflare/mesh` container image](https://developers.cloudflare.com/mesh/guides/run-mesh-in-containers/).
- Client devices can use any [operating system supported by the Cloudflare One Client](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/cloudflare-one-client/download/).
- Mesh nodes must use the MASQUE device tunnel protocol. Hostname routes, IPv6 CIDR routes, and high availability do not work with WireGuard.
- Using Cloudflare Mesh with Cloudflare WAN requires [Unified Routing mode](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-wan/reference/traffic-steering/#unified-routing).

For deployment recommendations and interoperability constraints, refer to [Best practices](https://developers.cloudflare.com/mesh/best-practices/).
