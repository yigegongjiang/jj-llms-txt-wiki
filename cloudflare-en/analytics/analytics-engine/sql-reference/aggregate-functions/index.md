# Aggregate functions

Last updated Apr 23, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/analytics/analytics-engine/sql-reference/aggregate-functions/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

## count

Usage:

```sql
count()
count(DISTINCT column_name)
```

`count` is an aggregation function that returns the number of rows in each group or results set.

`count` can also be used to count the number of distinct (unique) values in each column:

Example:

```sql
-- return the total number of rows
count()
-- return the number of different values in the column
count(DISTINCT column_name)
```

## sum

Usage:

```sql
sum([DISTINCT] column_name)
```

`sum` is an aggregation function that returns the sum of column values across all rows in each group or results set. Sum also supports `DISTINCT`, but in this case it will only sum the unique values in the column.

Example:

```sql
-- return the total cost of all items
sum(item_cost)
-- return the total of all unique item costs
sum(DISTINCT item_cost)
```

## avg

Usage:

```sql
avg([DISTINCT] column_name)
```

`avg` is an aggregation function that returns the mean of column values across all rows in each group or results set. Avg also supports `DISTINCT`, but in this case it will only average the unique values in the column.

Example:

```sql
-- return the mean item cost
avg(item_cost)
-- return the mean of unique item costs
avg(DISTINCT item_cost)
```

## min

Usage:

```sql
min(column_name)
```

`min` is an aggregation function that returns the minimum value of a column across all rows.

Example:

```sql
-- return the minimum item cost
min(item_cost)
```

## max

Usage:

```sql
max(column_name)
```

`max` is an aggregation function that returns the maximum value of a column across all rows.

Example:

```sql
-- return the maximum item cost
max(item_cost)
```

## quantileExactWeighted

Usage:

```sql
quantileExactWeighted(q)(column_name, weight_column_name)
```

`quantileExactWeighted` is an aggregation function that returns the value at the qth quantile in the named column across all rows in each group or results set. Each row will be weighted by the value in `weight_column_name`. Typically this would be `_sample_interval` (refer to [Sampling](https://developers.cloudflare.com/analytics/analytics-engine/sql-api/#sampling) for more information).

Example:

```sql
-- estimate the median value of <double1>
quantileExactWeighted(0.5)(double1, _sample_interval)

-- in a table of query times, estimate the 95th centile query time
quantileExactWeighted(0.95)(query_time, _sample_interval)
```

For backwards compatibility, this is also available as `quantileWeighted(q, column_name, weight_column_name)`.

## argMax New

Usage:

```sql
argMax(arg, val)
```

`argMax` is an aggregation function that returns the `arg` value that corresponds to the maximum value of `val`.

If multiple `arg` values have the maximum value of `val`, any one will be returned.

Example:

```sql
-- find the <blob1> value for the row with the highest <double1>
argMax(blob1, double1)

-- find the <blob1> value from the most heavily sampled row
argMax(blob1, _sample_interval)
```

## argMin New

Usage:

```sql
argMin(arg, val)
```

`argMin` is an aggregation function that returns the `arg` value that corresponds to the minimum value of `val`.

If multiple `arg` values have the minimum value of `val`, any one will be returned.

Example:

```sql
-- find the <blob1> value for the row with the lowest <double1>
argMin(blob1, double1)

-- find the <blob1> value from the least heavily sampled row
argMin(blob1, _sample_interval)
```

## first\_value New

Usage:

```sql
first_value(column_name)
```

`first_value` is an aggregation function which returns the first value of the provided column.

Example:

```sql
-- find the oldest value of <blob1>
SELECT first_value(blob1) FROM my_dataset ORDER BY timestamp ASC
```

## last\_value New

Usage:

```sql
last_value(column_name)
```

`last_value` is an aggregation function which returns the last value of the provided column.

Example:

```sql
-- find the oldest value of <blob1>
SELECT last_value(blob1) FROM my_dataset ORDER BY timestamp DESC
```

## topK New

Usage:

```sql
topK(N)(column)
```

`topK` is an aggregation function which returns the most common `N` values of a column.

`N` is optional and defaults to `10`.

Example:

```sql
-- find the 10 most common values of <double1>
SELECT topK(double1) FROM my_dataset

-- find the 15 most common values of <blob1>
SELECT topK(15)(blob1) FROM my_dataset
```

## topKWeighted New

Usage:

```sql
topKWeighted(N)(column, weight_column)
```

`topKWeighted` is an aggregation function which returns the most common `N` values of a column, weighted by a second column.

`N` is optional and defaults to `10`.

Example:

```sql
-- find the 10 most common values of <double1>, weighted by `_sample_interval`
SELECT topKWeighted(double1, _sample_interval) FROM my_dataset

-- find the 15 most common values of <blob1>, weighted by `_sample_interval`
SELECT topKWeighted(15)(blob1, _sample_interval) FROM my_dataset
```

## countIf New

Usage:

```sql
countIf(<expr>)
```

`countIf` is an aggregation function that returns the number of rows in the results set, but only counting rows where a provided expression evaluates to true.

Example:

```sql
-- return the number of rows where `double1` is greater than 5
countIf(double1 > 5)
```

## sumIf New

Usage:

```sql
sumIf(<expr>, <expr>)
```

`sumIf` is an aggregation function that returns the sum of a first expression across all rows in the results set, but only including rows where a second expression evaluates to true.

Example:

```sql
-- return the sum of column `item_cost` of all items where another column `in_stock` is not zero
sumIf(item_cost, in_stock > 0)
```

## avgIf New

Usage:

```sql
avgIf(<expr>, <expr>)
```

`avgIf` is an aggregation function that returns the mean of an expression across all rows in the results set, but only including rows where a second expression evaluates to true.

Example:

```sql
-- return the mean of column `item_cost` where another column `in_stock` is not zero
avgIf(item_cost, in_stock > 0)
```
