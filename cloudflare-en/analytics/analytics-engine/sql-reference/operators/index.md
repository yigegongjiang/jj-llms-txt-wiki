Last updated Apr 23, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/analytics/analytics-engine/sql-reference/operators/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

The following operators are supported:

## Arithmetic operators

| Operator | Description    |
| -------- | -------------- |
| +        | addition       |
| \-       | subtraction    |
| \*       | multiplication |
| /        | division       |
| %        | modulus        |

## Comparison operators

| Operator | Description                                                                                            |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| \=       | equals                                                                                                 |
| <        | less than                                                                                              |
| \>       | greater than                                                                                           |
| <=       | less than or equal to                                                                                  |
| \>=      | greater than or equal to                                                                               |
| <> or != | not equal                                                                                              |
| IN       | true if the preceding expression's value is in the listcolumn IN ('a', 'list', 'of', 'values')         |
| NOT IN   | true if the preceding expression's value is not in the listcolumn NOT IN ('a', 'list', 'of', 'values') |

We also support the `BETWEEN` operator for checking a value is in an inclusive range: `a [NOT] BETWEEN b AND c`.

### Pattern matching operators New

| Operator  | Description                                                                                 |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| LIKE      | true if the string matches the pattern (case-sensitive)column LIKE 'pattern%'               |
| NOT LIKE  | true if the string does not match the pattern (case-sensitive)column NOT LIKE 'pattern%'    |
| ILIKE     | true if the string matches the pattern (case-insensitive)column ILIKE 'pattern%'            |
| NOT ILIKE | true if the string does not match the pattern (case-insensitive)column NOT ILIKE 'pattern%' |

Pattern matching supports two wildcard characters:

* `%` matches any sequence of zero or more characters
* `_` matches any single character

Examples:

```sql
-- Match strings starting with "error"
WHERE blob1 LIKE 'error%'

-- Match strings ending with ".jpg" (case-insensitive)
WHERE blob2 ILIKE '%.jpg'

-- Match strings containing "test" anywhere
WHERE blob3 LIKE '%test%'

-- Match exactly 5 characters starting with "log"
WHERE blob4 LIKE 'log__'

-- Exclude strings containing "debug" (case-insensitive)
WHERE blob5 NOT ILIKE '%debug%'
```

## Boolean operators

| Operator | Description                                                          |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| AND      | boolean "AND" (true if both sides are true)                          |
| OR       | boolean "OR" (true if either side or both sides are true)            |
| NOT      | boolean "NOT" (true if following expression is false and visa-versa) |

## Unary operators

| Operator | Description                           |
| -------- | ------------------------------------- |
| \-       | negation operator (for example, \-42) |
