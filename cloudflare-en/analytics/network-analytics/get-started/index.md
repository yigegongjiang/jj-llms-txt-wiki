# Get started

Last updated Apr 23, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/analytics/network-analytics/get-started/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Requirements

Network Analytics requires the following:

* A Cloudflare Enterprise plan.
* Cloudflare Magic Transit or Spectrum.
* Cloudflare WAN.

## View the Network Analytics dashboard

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Network Analytics** page.  
[Go to **Network analytics** ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/networking-insights/analytics/network-analytics/transport-analytics)
2. Select an account that has access to Magic Transit or Spectrum.
3. Configure the displayed data. You can [adjust the time range](https://developers.cloudflare.com/analytics/network-analytics/configure/time-range/), [select the main metric](https://developers.cloudflare.com/analytics/network-analytics/configure/displayed-data/#select-high-level-metric) (total packets or total bytes), [apply filters](https://developers.cloudflare.com/analytics/network-analytics/configure/displayed-data/#apply-filters), and more.

## Get Network Analytics data via API

Use the [GraphQL Analytics API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/analytics/graphql-api/) to query data using the available [Network Analytics nodes](https://developers.cloudflare.com/analytics/graphql-api/migration-guides/network-analytics-v2/node-reference/).

## Send Network Analytics logs to a third-party service

[Create a Logpush job](https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/logpush/logpush-job/enable-destinations/) that sends Network analytics logs to your storage service, SIEM solution, or log management provider.

## Limitations

Users with the `Analytics` role will have visibility to IDs but will not see the following on the Network Analytics dashboard:

* Tunnel names
* Prefix names
* [Cloudflare Network Firewall](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-network-firewall/) rules
* [DDoS managed rulesets](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ddos-protection/managed-rulesets/)
* Override names
