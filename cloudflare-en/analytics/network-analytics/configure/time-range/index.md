# Adjust the time range

## Using the timeframe drop-down list

Use the timeframe drop-down list to change the time range over which Network Analytics displays data. When you select a timeframe, the entire view is updated to reflect your choice.

In the Network Analytics dashboard, the range of historical data you can query is 112 days.

When you select _Previous 30 minutes_, the **Network Analytics** card will show the data from the last 30 minutes, refreshing every 20 seconds. A _Live_ notification appears next to the statistic drop-down list to let you know that the view keeps updating automatically:

## Zooming in the chart

To zoom in a specific period, select and drag to define a region in the **Packets summary** (or **Bits summary**) chart. To zoom out, select **X** in the time range selector.

The effective resolution goes up when you zoom in and goes down when you zoom out, due to the [Adaptive Bit Rate](https://developers.cloudflare.com/analytics/network-analytics/understand/concepts/#adaptive-bit-rate-sampling). This means that a big packet burst that lasted a few seconds may look less impactful when analyzing a chart displaying data for 24 hours or more.
