# Network analytics

Last updated Apr 23, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/analytics/network-analytics/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Cloudflare Network Analytics (version 2) provides near real-time visibility into network and transport-layer traffic patterns and DDoS attacks. Network Analytics visualizes packet and bit-level data, the same data available via the Network Analytics dataset of the GraphQL Analytics API.

Requirements

Network Analytics requires the following:

* A Cloudflare Enterprise plan.
* Cloudflare Magic Transit or Spectrum.
* Cloudflare WAN.

For a technical deep-dive into Network Analytics, refer to our [blog post ↗](https://blog.cloudflare.com/building-network-analytics-v2/).

## Remarks

* The Network Analytics logs refer to IP traffic of Magic Transit customer prefixes/leased IP addresses or Spectrum applications. These logs are not directly associated with the [zones](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/concepts/accounts-and-zones/#zones) in your Cloudflare account.
* The data retention for Network Analytics is 16 weeks. Additionally, data older than eight weeks might have lower resolution when using narrow time frames.
