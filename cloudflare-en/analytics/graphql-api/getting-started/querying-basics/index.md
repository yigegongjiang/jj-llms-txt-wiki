# Querying basics

Last updated Apr 23, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/analytics/graphql-api/getting-started/querying-basics/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

## Structure of a GraphQL query

GraphQL structures data as a graph. GraphQL uses a schema to define the objects and their hierarchy in your data graph. You can explore the edges of the graph by using queries to get the needed data. These queries must respect the structure of the schema.

A **node**, followed by its **fields**, is at the core of a GraphQL query. A node is an object of a specific **type**; the type specifies the fields that make up the object.

A field can be another node where the appropriate query would contain nested elements. Some nodes look like functions that can take on arguments to limit the scope of what they can act on. You can apply filters at each node.

## Cloudflare GraphQL schema

A typical query against the Cloudflare GraphQL schema is made up of four main components:

* `viewer` \- is the root node,
* `zones` or `accounts` \- indicate the scope of the query, that is the domain area or account you want to query. The `viewer` can access one `zones` or `accounts`, or both,
* **data node** or **dataset** \- represent the data you want to query. `zones`or `accounts` may contain one or more datasets. To find out more about discovering nodes, please refer to [introspection](https://developers.cloudflare.com/analytics/graphql-api/features/discovery/introspection/),
* **fieldset** \- a set of fields or nested fields of the **dataset**.

The query to Cloudflare GraphQL API must be sent over HTTP POST request with payload in JSON format that consists of these fields:

```json
{
	"query": "",
	"variables": {}
}
```

From the above structure, the `query` field must contain a GraphQL query formatted as a **single line** string (meaning all newline symbols should be stripped / escaped), when `variables` is an object that contains all values of used placeholders in the query itself.

## A single dataset example

In the following example, the GraphQL query fetches a `datetime`, `action`, and client request HTTP host as `host` field of 2 WAF events from zone-scoped `firewallEventsAdaptive` dataset.

```graphql
query ASingleDatasetExample($zoneTag: string, $start: Time, $end: Time) {
	viewer {
		zones(filter: { zoneTag: $zoneTag }) {
			firewallEventsAdaptive(
				filter: { datetime_gt: $start, datetime_lt: $end }
				limit: 2
				orderBy: [datetime_DESC]
			) {
				action
				datetime
				host: clientRequestHTTPHost
			}
		}
	}
}
```

In the query above, we have variable placeholders: $zoneTag, $start, and $end. We provide values for those placeholders alongside the query by placing them into `variables` field of the payload. Note that the examples below use the UTC timezone, indicated by the letter "Z".

```json
{
	"zoneTag": "<zone-tag>",
	"start": "2020-08-03T02:07:05Z",
	"end": "2020-08-03T17:07:05Z"
}
```

There are multiple ways to send your query to Cloudflare GraphQL API. You can use you favourite GraphQL client or CLI to send a request via curl. We have a [how-to guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/analytics/graphql-api/getting-started/compose-graphql-query/) about using GraphiQL client, also check a guide on how to execute a query with a curl [here](https://developers.cloudflare.com/analytics/graphql-api/getting-started/execute-graphql-query/).

```json
{
	"data": {
		"viewer": {
			"zones": [
				{
					"firewallEventsAdaptive": [
						{
							"action": "log",
							"host": "cloudflare.guru",
							"datetime": "2020-08-03T17:07:03Z"
						},
						{
							"action": "log",
							"host": "cloudflare.guru",
							"datetime": "2020-08-03T17:07:01Z"
						}
					]
				}
			]
		}
	},
	"errors": null
}
```

## Query multiple datasets in a single GraphQL API request

As previously mentioned, a query might contain one or multiple nodes (datasets). At the API level, the data extraction would be done simultaneously, but the response would be delayed until all dataset queries got their results. If any fails during the execution, the entire query will be terminated, and the error will be returned.

```graphql
query MultipleDatasetsExample(
	$zoneTag: string
	$start: Time
	$end: Time
	$ts: Date
) {
	viewer {
		zones(filter: { zoneTag: $zoneTag }) {
			last10Events: firewallEventsAdaptive(
				filter: { datetime_gt: $start, datetime_lt: $end }
				limit: 10
				orderBy: [datetime_DESC]
			) {
				action
				datetime
				host: clientRequestHTTPHost
			}
			top3DeviceTypes: httpRequestsAdaptiveGroups(
				filter: { date: $ts }
				limit: 10
				orderBy: [count_DESC]
			) {
				count
				dimensions {
					device: clientDeviceType
				}
			}
		}
	}
}
```

```json
{
	"zoneTag": "<zone-tag>",
	"start": "2022-10-02T00:26:49Z",
	"end": "2022-10-04T14:26:49Z",
	"ts": "2022-10-04"
}
```

```json
{
	"data": {
		"viewer": {
			"zones": [
				{
					"last10Events": [
						{
							"action": "block",
							"country": "TR",
							"datetime": "2022-10-04T08:41:09Z"
						},
						{
							"action": "block",
							"country": "TR",
							"datetime": "2022-10-04T08:41:09Z"
						},
						{
							"action": "block",
							"country": "RU",
							"datetime": "2022-10-04T01:09:36Z"
						},
						{
							"action": "block",
							"country": "US",
							"datetime": "2022-10-03T14:26:49Z"
						},
						{
							"action": "block",

							"country": "CN",
							"datetime": "2022-10-02T23:51:26Z"
						},
						{
							"action": "block",
							"country": "TR",
							"datetime": "2022-10-02T23:39:41Z"
						},
						{
							"action": "block",
							"country": "TR",
							"datetime": "2022-10-02T23:39:41Z"
						}
					],
					"top3DeviceTypes": [
						{
							"count": 4580,
							"dimensions": {
								"device": "desktop"
							}
						}
					]
				}
			]
		}
	},
	"errors": null
}
```
