# Introspection

Last updated Apr 23, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/analytics/graphql-api/features/discovery/introspection/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Cloudflare GraphQL API has a dynamic schema and exposes more than 70 datasets across zone and account scopes. We constantly expand the list and replace existing ones with more capable alternatives.

To tackle the schema question, GraphQL provides an [introspection ↗](https://graphql.org/learn/introspection/) mechanism. It is part of the GraphQL specification and allows you to explore the graph of the datasets and fields.

The introspection results provide an overview of ALL available nodes and fields, their descriptions and deprecation status.

Although GraphQL has `query`, `subscription`, and `mutation` operations, Cloudflare GraphQL API only supports `query` operation.

## Description and Beta mode

With details on data exposed by a given node or a field, descriptions also indicate whether it is in Beta mode. Beta nodes (or fields) are for testing and exploration and are usually available for customers on more extensive plans. Please do not rely on beta data nodes since they are subject to change or removal without notice.

## Deprecation

Introspection provides information about deprecation status. Cloudflare uses it as a notification about replacement plans. If the sunset date is provided, please migrate to a replacement node(s) before that date to avoid any disruption.

## Availability

Some of the nodes might only be available to query for some users. Please refer to the [settings](https://developers.cloudflare.com/analytics/graphql-api/features/discovery/settings/) node for more details about availability and personal limits on a given node.

## Explore documentation

The most convenient way to introspect the schema is to use a documentation [explorer](https://developers.cloudflare.com/analytics/graphql-api/getting-started/explore-graphql-schema/) that usually is a part of a GraphQL client (like GraphiQL, Altair, etc).

Alternatively, you can also do it manually by using `__schema` node with the needed directives.

```graphql
{
	__schema {
		queryType {
			name
		}
		mutationType {
			name
		}
		subscriptionType {
			name
		}
		types {
			...FullType
		}
		directives {
			name
			description
			locations
			args {
				...InputValue
			}
		}
	}
}
fragment TypeRef on __Type {
	kind
	name
	ofType {
		kind
		name
		ofType {
			kind
			name
			ofType {
				kind
				name
				ofType {
					kind
					name
					ofType {
						kind
						name
						ofType {
							kind
							name
							ofType {
								kind
								name
							}
						}
					}
				}
			}
		}
	}
}
fragment InputValue on __InputValue {
	name
	description
	type {
		...TypeRef
	}
	defaultValue
}
fragment FullType on __Type {
	kind
	name
	description
	fields(includeDeprecated: true) {
		name
		description
		args {
			...InputValue
		}
		type {
			...TypeRef
		}
		isDeprecated
		deprecationReason
	}
	inputFields {
		...InputValue
	}
	interfaces {
		...TypeRef
	}
	enumValues(includeDeprecated: true) {
		name
		description
		isDeprecated
		deprecationReason
	}
	possibleTypes {
		...TypeRef
	}
}
```
