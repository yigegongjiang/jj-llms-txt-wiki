This tutorial explains how to analyze Cloudflare metrics using the [Cloudflare Integration tile for Datadog ↗](https://docs.datadoghq.com/integrations/cloudflare/).

## Overview

Before viewing the Cloudflare dashboard in Datadog, note that this integration:

* Is available to all Cloudflare customer plans (Free, Pro, Business and Enterprise)
* Is based on the Cloudflare Analytics API
* Provides Cloudflare web traffic and DNS metrics only
* Does not feature data coming from request logs stored in Cloudflare Logs

## Task 1 - Install the Cloudflare App

To install the Cloudflare App for Datadog:

1. Log in to **Datadog**.
2. Click the **Integrations** tab.
3. In the **search box**, start typing _Cloudflare_. The app tile should appear below the search box. ![Searching for Cloudflare App in the Datadog Integrations tab](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/image/onerror=redirect,width=1210,height=738,format=webp/_astro/datadog-integrations.BJs60jr6.png)
4. Click the **Cloudflare** tile to begin the installation.
5. Next, click **Configuration** and then complete the following:

  * **Account name**: (Optional) This can be any value. It has not impact on the site data pulled from Cloudflare.
  * **Email**: This value helps keep your account safe. We recommend creating a dedicated Cloudflare user for analytics with the [_Analytics_ role](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/manage-members/roles/) (read-only). Note that the _Analytics_ role is available to Enterprise customers only.
  * **API Key**: Enter your Cloudflare Global API key. For details refer to [API Keys](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/get-started/keys/).
6. Click **Install Integration**. ![Configuring and installing the Datadog integration](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/image/onerror=redirect,width=1324,height=656,format=webp/_astro/cloudflare-tile-datadog-fill-details.Bd14uPIs.png)

The Cloudflare App for Datadog should be installed now and you can view the dashboard.

## Task 2 - View the dashboard

By default, the dashboard displays metrics for all sites in your Cloudflare account. Use the dashboard filters see metrics for a specific domain.

The dashboard displays the following metrics:

* **Threats** (threats by type, threats by country)
* **Requests** (total requests, cached requests, uncached requests, top countries by request, requests by IP class, top content types)
* **Bandwidth** (total bandwidth, encrypted and unencrypted traffic cached bandwidth, uncached bandwidth)
* **Caching** (Cache hit rate, request caching rate over time)
* **HTTP response status errors**
* **Page views**
* **Search Engine Bot Traffic**
* **DNS** (DNS queries, response time, top hostnames, queries by type, stale vs. uncached queries)
