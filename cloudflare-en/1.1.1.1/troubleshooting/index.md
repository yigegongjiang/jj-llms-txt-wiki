# Troubleshooting

This guide helps you diagnose and resolve common issues with Cloudflare's DNS Resolver. Before proceeding with manual troubleshooting steps, [verify your connection](https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/check/) to automatically gather relevant information.

## Name resolution issues

If a domain name is not resolving correctly, test DNS resolution against 1.1.1.1 and compare the result to another resolver (such as `8.8.8.8`). The CHAOS TXT queries (`id.server`) identify which Cloudflare server handled your request, which is useful when reporting issues.

### Linux/macOS

```sh
# Test DNS resolution
dig example.com @1.1.1.1
dig example.com @1.0.0.1
dig example.com @8.8.8.8

# Check connected nameserver
dig +short CHAOS TXT id.server @1.1.1.1
dig +short CHAOS TXT id.server @1.0.0.1

# Optional: Network information
dig @ns3.cloudflare.com whoami.cloudflare.com txt +short
```

### Windows

```sh
# Test DNS resolution
nslookup example.com 1.1.1.1
nslookup example.com 1.0.0.1
nslookup example.com 8.8.8.8

# Check connected nameserver
nslookup -class=chaos -type=txt id.server 1.1.1.1
nslookup -class=chaos -type=txt id.server 1.0.0.1

# Optional: Network information
nslookup -type=txt whoami.cloudflare.com ns3.cloudflare.com
```

Caution

The network information command reveals your IP address. Only include this in reports to Cloudflare if you are comfortable sharing this information.

For additional analysis, you can generate a [DNSViz ↗](http://dnsviz.net/) report for the domain in question.

## Connectivity and routing issues

If DNS queries time out or you cannot reach 1.1.1.1 at all, the problem may be a network routing issue between your device and Cloudflare. Run traceroutes to both resolver addresses to identify where packets are being dropped.

Before reporting connectivity issues:

1. Search for existing reports from your country and ISP.
2. Run traceroutes to both Cloudflare DNS resolvers.

### Linux/macOS

```sh
# Basic connectivity tests
traceroute 1.1.1.1
traceroute 1.0.0.1

# If reachable, check nameserver identity
dig +short CHAOS TXT id.server @1.1.1.1
dig +short CHAOS TXT id.server @1.0.0.1

# TCP connection tests
dig +tcp @1.1.1.1 id.server CH TXT
dig +tcp @1.0.0.1 id.server CH TXT
```

### Windows

```sh
# Basic connectivity tests
tracert 1.1.1.1
tracert 1.0.0.1

# If reachable, check nameserver identity
nslookup -class=chaos -type=txt id.server 1.1.1.1
nslookup -class=chaos -type=txt id.server 1.0.0.1

# TCP connection tests
nslookup -vc -class=chaos -type=txt id.server 1.1.1.1
nslookup -vc -class=chaos -type=txt id.server 1.0.0.1
```

## DNS-over-TLS (DoT) troubleshooting

DNS over TLS encrypts DNS queries using TLS on port `853`. If your DoT connection is not working, test TLS connectivity and then DNS resolution over TLS.

### Linux/macOS

```sh
# Test TLS connectivity
openssl s_client -connect 1.1.1.1:853
openssl s_client -connect 1.0.0.1:853

# Test DNS resolution over TLS
kdig +tls @1.1.1.1 id.server CH TXT
kdig +tls @1.0.0.1 id.server CH TXT
```

### Windows

Windows does not include a standalone DoT client. You can test TLS connectivity using OpenSSL after installing it manually.

## DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) troubleshooting

DNS over HTTPS sends DNS queries as HTTPS requests. If your DoH connection is not working, test it by querying the Cloudflare DNS endpoint directly.

### Linux/macOS

```sh
curl -H 'accept: application/dns-json' 'https://cloudflare-dns.com/dns-query?name=cloudflare.com&type=AAAA'
```

### Windows

```powershell
(Invoke-WebRequest -Uri 'https://cloudflare-dns.com/dns-query?name=cloudflare.com&type=AAAA').RawContent
```

## Common issues

### First hop failures

If your traceroute fails at the first hop (the first network device after your computer, usually your router), the issue is likely hardware-related. Your router may have a hardcoded route for `1.1.1.1` that conflicts with using it as a DNS resolver. When reporting this issue, include:

* Router make and model
* ISP name
* Any relevant router configuration details
