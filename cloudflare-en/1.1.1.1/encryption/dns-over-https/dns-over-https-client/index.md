# Connect to 1.1.1.1 using DoH clients

Last updated May 5, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/encryption/dns-over-https/dns-over-https-client/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

A DoH client is a software that runs on your device and sends DNS queries to a resolver like 1.1.1.1 over an encrypted HTTPS connection. Once configured, the client handles DNS resolution for your device or network.

## Cloudflare WARP client

Refer to [WARP client](https://developers.cloudflare.com/warp-client/) for guidance on WARP modes and get-started information for different [operating systems](https://developers.cloudflare.com/warp-client/get-started/).

## DNSCrypt-Proxy

[DNSCrypt-Proxy ↗](https://dnscrypt.info) 2.0+ supports DoH out of the box. It supports both 1.1.1.1 and other services. It also includes more advanced features, such as load balancing and local filtering.

1. [Install DNSCrypt-Proxy ↗](https://github.com/jedisct1/dnscrypt-proxy/wiki/installation).
2. Verify that `dnscrypt-proxy` is installed and the version is 2.0 or later:  
```sh  
dnscrypt-proxy -version  
```  
```sh
2.0.8  
```
3. Set up the configuration file using the [official instructions ↗](https://github.com/jedisct1/dnscrypt-proxy/wiki/installation#setting-up-dnscrypt-proxy), and add `cloudflare` and `cloudflare-ipv6` to the server list in `dnscrypt-proxy.toml`:  
```toml  
server_names = ['cloudflare', 'cloudflare-ipv6']  
```
4. Make sure that nothing else is running on `localhost:53` (port `53` is the standard DNS port on your local machine), and check that everything works as expected:  
```sh  
dnscrypt-proxy -resolve cloudflare-dns.com  
```  
```sh  
Resolving [cloudflare-dns.com]  
Domain exists:  yes, 3 name servers found  
Canonical name: cloudflare-dns.com.  
IP addresses:   2400:cb00:2048:1::6810:6f19, 2400:cb00:2048:1::6810:7019, 104.16.111.25, 104.16.112.25  
TXT records:    -  
Resolver IP:    172.68.140.217  
```
5. Register it as a system service so that it starts automatically when your device boots. Follow the [DNSCrypt-Proxy installation instructions ↗](https://github.com/jedisct1/dnscrypt-proxy/wiki/installation).
