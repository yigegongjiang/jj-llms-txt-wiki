# Linux

Last updated May 1, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/setup/linux/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Before you begin, take note of any DNS addresses you might have set up, and save them in a safe place in case you need to use them later.

You can configure 1.1.1.1 using the [command line](#use-command-line-interface-cli) or a [graphical interface](#use-graphical-user-interface-gui).

## Use command line interface (CLI)

If you want to use 1.1.1.1 for Families instead of the standard resolver, replace `1.1.1.1` in the examples below with the corresponding [IPv4 or IPv6 address](https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/ip-addresses/).

### `resolv.conf`

On most Linux distributions, `/etc/resolv.conf` controls which DNS resolver the system uses.

To set `1.1.1.1` as your DNS resolver with `1.0.0.1` as a backup:

```sh
echo -e "nameserver 1.1.1.1\nnameserver 1.0.0.1" | sudo tee /etc/resolv.conf
```

Caution

Some services — such as DHCP clients or `NetworkManager` — automatically overwrite `/etc/resolv.conf` when your network connection changes. If your DNS settings revert after a reboot or reconnection, configure 1.1.1.1 in your network manager or DHCP client instead.

You can also edit `/etc/resolv.conf` manually with a text editor like `nano` or `vim`.

### `systemd-resolved`

If your system uses `systemd-resolved` to manage DNS, edit the configuration file at `/etc/systemd/resolved.conf`:

1. Run the following command, replacing `<EDITOR>` with your preferred editor.

```sh
sudo <EDITOR> /etc/systemd/resolved.conf
```

1. In the editor, add or edit the following lines:

```txt
[Resolve]
DNS=1.1.1.1
```

To use DNS over TLS, append `#one.one.one.one` after the IP address (this tells `systemd-resolved` which hostname to use for TLS verification) and set `DNSOverTLS` to `yes`:

```txt
[Resolve]
DNS=1.1.1.1#one.one.one.one
DNSOverTLS=yes
```

## Use graphical user interface (GUI)

### GNOME

1. Go to **Show Applications** \> **Settings** \> **Network**.
2. Select the adapter you want to configure — such as your Ethernet adapter or Wi-Fi card — and select the **Settings** button.
3. On the **IPv4** tab > **DNS** section, disable the **Automatic** toggle.
4. Depending on what you want to configure, choose one of the following DNS addresses for IPv4:  
Use 1.1.1.1 resolver  
```txt
1.1.1.1
1.0.0.1  
```  
Block malware with 1.1.1.1 for Families  
```txt
1.1.1.2
1.0.0.2  
```  
Block malware and adult content with 1.1.1.1 for Families  
```txt
1.1.1.3
1.0.0.3  
```
5. Go to **IPv6**.
6. Depending on what you want to configure, choose one of the following DNS addresses for IPv6:  
Use 1.1.1.1 resolver  
```txt  
2606:4700:4700::1111  
2606:4700:4700::1001  
```  
Block malware with 1.1.1.1 for Families  
```txt  
2606:4700:4700::1112  
2606:4700:4700::1002  
```  
Block malware and adult content with 1.1.1.1 for Families  
```txt  
2606:4700:4700::1113  
2606:4700:4700::1003  
```
7. Select **Apply**.

### KDE Plasma

1. Go to **System Settings** \> **Wi-Fi & Internet** \> **Wi-Fi & Networking**. (or **Connections**, if on Plasma 5)
2. Select the connection you want to configure - like your current connected network.
3. On the **IPv4** tab, select the **Method** drop-down menu > _Automatic (Only addresses)_.
4. Select the text box next to **DNS servers**.
5. Depending on what you want to configure, choose one of the following DNS addresses for IPv4:  
Use 1.1.1.1 resolver  
```txt
1.1.1.1
1.0.0.1  
```  
Block malware with 1.1.1.1 for Families  
```txt
1.1.1.2
1.0.0.2  
```  
Block malware and adult content with 1.1.1.1 for Families  
```txt
1.1.1.3
1.0.0.3  
```
6. On the **IPv6** tab, select the **Method** drop-down menu > _Automatic (Only addresses)_.
7. Select the text box next to **DNS servers**.
8. Depending on what you want to configure, choose one of the following DNS addresses for IPv6:  
Use 1.1.1.1 resolver  
```txt  
2606:4700:4700::1111  
2606:4700:4700::1001  
```  
Block malware with 1.1.1.1 for Families  
```txt  
2606:4700:4700::1112  
2606:4700:4700::1002  
```  
Block malware and adult content with 1.1.1.1 for Families  
```txt  
2606:4700:4700::1113  
2606:4700:4700::1003  
```
9. Select **Apply**.

Note

Setting up a static IP address to configure a DNS server may prevent you from connecting to some public Wi-Fi networks that use captive portals — these are the web pages some wireless networks employ to let users log in and use their services.

If you are experiencing connectivity issues related to captive portals:

1. Remove the static IP addresses from the device or disable the 1.1.1.1 app.
2. Connect to the Wi-Fi network.
3. Once the connection has been established, re-add the static IP addresses or enable the 1.1.1.1 app.
