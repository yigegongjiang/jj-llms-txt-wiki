The [1.1.1.1: Faster Internet ↗](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/1-1-1-1-faster-internet/id1423538627) app is the recommended way to set up 1.1.1.1 on iOS. It automatically configures your device to use 1.1.1.1 on any network you connect to, including cellular networks (which cannot use a custom DNS resolver through manual iOS settings alone).

The app also allows you to enable encryption for DNS queries or enable [WARP mode](https://developers.cloudflare.com/warp-client/), which keeps all your HTTP traffic private and secure, including your DNS queries to 1.1.1.1.

You can select between these options in the app settings. By default, the app uses WARP mode.

## Set up 1.1.1.1: Faster Internet

1. Download [1.1.1.1: Faster Internet from the App Store ↗](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/1-1-1-1-faster-internet/id1423538627) for free.
2. Launch 1.1.1.1: Faster Internet and accept the Terms of Service.
3. Install the VPN profile that allows your phone to connect securely to 1.1.1.1.
4. Toggle the **WARP** button to **Connected**.

### Enable 1.1.1.1 for Families

1. Open 1.1.1.1: Faster Internet.
2. Tap the **menu button**.
3. Select **Advanced** \> **Connection options**.
4. In **DNS settings** \> **1.1.1.1 for Families**, select the option you want to use.

## Configure 1.1.1.1 manually

Note

Manual configuration only applies to the Wi-Fi network you are currently connected to. You will need to repeat these steps for each new Wi-Fi network. This method does not work for cellular connections.

Take note of any DNS addresses you might have set up, and save them in a safe place in case you need to use them later.

1. Go to **Settings** \> **Wi-Fi**.
2. Select the **'i'** icon next to the Wi-Fi network you are connected to.
3. Scroll down and select **Configure DNS**.
4. Change the configuration from **Automatic** to **Manual**.
5. Select **Add Server**.
6. Depending on what you want to configure, choose one of the following DNS addresses for IPv4:  
Use 1.1.1.1 resolver  
```txt
1.1.1.1
1.0.0.1  
```  
Block malware with 1.1.1.1 for Families  
```txt
1.1.1.2
1.0.0.2  
```  
Block malware and adult content with 1.1.1.1 for Families  
```txt
1.1.1.3
1.0.0.3  
```
7. Depending on what you want to configure, choose one of the following DNS addresses for IPv6:  
Use 1.1.1.1 resolver  
```txt  
2606:4700:4700::1111  
2606:4700:4700::1001  
```  
Block malware with 1.1.1.1 for Families  
```txt  
2606:4700:4700::1112  
2606:4700:4700::1002  
```  
Block malware and adult content with 1.1.1.1 for Families  
```txt  
2606:4700:4700::1113  
2606:4700:4700::1003  
```
8. Select **Save**.

Note

Setting up a static IP address to configure a DNS server may prevent you from connecting to some public Wi-Fi networks that use captive portals — these are the web pages some wireless networks employ to let users log in and use their services.

If you are experiencing connectivity issues related to captive portals:

1. Remove the static IP addresses from the device or disable the 1.1.1.1 app.
2. Connect to the Wi-Fi network.
3. Once the connection has been established, re-add the static IP addresses or enable the 1.1.1.1 app.
