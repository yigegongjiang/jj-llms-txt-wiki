# Android

Last updated Jun 23, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/setup/android/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

The [1.1.1.1: Faster Internet ↗](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cloudflare.onedotonedotonedotone) app is the recommended way to set up 1.1.1.1 on Android. It automatically configures your phone to use 1.1.1.1 on any network you connect to.

The app also allows you to enable encryption for DNS queries or enable [WARP mode](https://developers.cloudflare.com/warp-client/), which keeps all your HTTP traffic private and secure, including your DNS queries to 1.1.1.1.

You can select between these options in the app settings. By default, the app uses WARP mode.

## Set up 1.1.1.1: Faster Internet

1. Download [1.1.1.1: Faster Internet from Google Play ↗](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cloudflare.onedotonedotonedotone) for free.
2. Launch 1.1.1.1: Faster Internet and accept the Terms of Service.
3. Toggle the **WARP** button to **Connected**.
4. Install the VPN profile that allows your phone to connect securely to 1.1.1.1.

Your connection to the Internet and your DNS queries are now protected.

### Enable 1.1.1.1 for Families

1. Open 1.1.1.1: Faster Internet.
2. Tap the **menu button**.
3. Select **Advanced** \> **Connection options**.
4. In **DNS settings** \> **1.1.1.1 for Families**, select the option you want to use.

## Configure 1.1.1.1 manually

### Android 9 and later

Android 9 and later support encrypted DNS through a feature called Private DNS, which uses DNS-over-TLS (DoT), or DNS-over-HTTP/3\. When you configure Private DNS, your device uses that DNS resolver on all networks — including cellular.

1. Go to **Settings** \> **Network & internet**.
2. Select **Advanced** \> **Private DNS**.
3. Select the **Private DNS provider hostname** option.
4. Enter one of the following hostnames and select **Save**.

Use 1.1.1.1 resolver

* `one.one.one.one`

Or the corresponding IP address if your device requires it:

* **IPv4**: `1.1.1.1` or `1.0.0.1`
* **IPv6**: `2606:4700:4700::1111` or `2606:4700:4700::1001`

Block malware with 1.1.1.1 for Families

* `security.cloudflare-dns.com`

Or the corresponding IP address if your device requires it:

* **IPv4**: `1.1.1.2` or `1.0.0.2`
* **IPv6**: `2606:4700:4700::1112` or `2606:4700:4700::1002`

Block malware and adult content with 1.1.1.1 for Families

* `family.cloudflare-dns.com`

Or the corresponding IP address if your device requires it:

* **IPv4**: `1.1.1.3` or `1.0.0.3`
* **IPv6**: `2606:4700:4700::1113` or `2606:4700:4700::1003`

### Previous Android versions

Before making changes, take note of any DNS addresses you might have and save them in a safe place in case you need to use them later.

1. Open **Settings** \> **Wi-Fi**.
2. Press down and hold the name of the network you are currently connected to.
3. Select **Modify Network**.
4. Select the checkbox **Show Advanced Options**.
5. Change the IP Settings to **Static**.
6. Depending on what you want to configure, choose one of the following DNS addresses for IPv4:  
Use 1.1.1.1 resolver  
```txt
1.1.1.1
1.0.0.1  
```  
Block malware with 1.1.1.1 for Families  
```txt
1.1.1.2
1.0.0.2  
```  
Block malware and adult content with 1.1.1.1 for Families  
```txt
1.1.1.3
1.0.0.3  
```
7. Depending on what you want to configure, choose one of the following DNS addresses for IPv6:  
Use 1.1.1.1 resolver  
```txt  
2606:4700:4700::1111  
2606:4700:4700::1001  
```  
Block malware with 1.1.1.1 for Families  
```txt  
2606:4700:4700::1112  
2606:4700:4700::1002  
```  
Block malware and adult content with 1.1.1.1 for Families  
```txt  
2606:4700:4700::1113  
2606:4700:4700::1003  
```
8. Select **Save**. You may need to disconnect from the Wi-Fi and reconnect for the changes to take effect.

Note

Setting up a static IP address to configure a DNS server may prevent you from connecting to some public Wi-Fi networks that use captive portals — these are the web pages some wireless networks employ to let users log in and use their services.

If you are experiencing connectivity issues related to captive portals:

1. Remove the static IP addresses from the device or disable the 1.1.1.1 app.
2. Connect to the Wi-Fi network.
3. Once the connection has been established, re-add the static IP addresses or enable the 1.1.1.1 app.
