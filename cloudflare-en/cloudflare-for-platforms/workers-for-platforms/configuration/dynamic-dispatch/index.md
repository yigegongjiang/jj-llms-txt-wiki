# Dynamic dispatch Worker

Last updated Apr 21, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-for-platforms/workers-for-platforms/configuration/dynamic-dispatch/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

A [dynamic dispatch Worker](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-for-platforms/workers-for-platforms/how-workers-for-platforms-works/#dynamic-dispatch-worker) is a specialized routing Worker that directs incoming requests to the appropriate user Workers in your dispatch namespace. Instead of using [Workers Routes](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/routing/routes/), dispatch Workers let you programmatically control request routing through code.

Note

You can also create a dispatch Worker from the Cloudflare dashboard. Go to **Workers for Platforms**, select your namespace, and click **Create** \> **Dispatch Worker**. The dashboard provides templates for path-based and subdomain-based routing.

#### Why use a dynamic dispatch Worker?

* **Scale**: Route requests to millions of hostnames to different Workers, without defining [Workers Routes](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/routing/routes/) configuration for each one
* **Custom routing logic**: Write code to determine exactly how requests should be routed. For example:  
  * Store hostname-to-Worker mappings in [Workers KV](https://developers.cloudflare.com/kv/) and look them up dynamically
  * Route requests based on subdomain, path, headers, or other request properties
  * Use [custom metadata](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/domain-support/custom-metadata/) attached to [custom hostnames](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/domain-support/) for routing decisions
* **Add platform functionality**: Build additional features at the routing layer:  
  * Run authentication checks before requests reach user Workers
  * Remove or add headers or metadata from incoming requests
  * Attach useful context like user IDs or account information
  * Transform requests or responses as needed

### Configure the dispatch namespace binding

To allow your dynamic dispatch Worker to dynamically route requests to Workers in a namespace, you need to configure a dispatch namespace [binding](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/). This binding enables your dynamic dispatch Worker to call any user Worker within that namespace using `env.dispatcher.get()`.

```jsonc
{
	"dispatch_namespaces": [
		{
			"binding": "DISPATCHER",
			"namespace": "my-dispatch-namespace"
		}
	]
}
```

```toml
[[dispatch_namespaces]]
binding = "DISPATCHER"
namespace = "my-dispatch-namespace"
```

Once the binding is configured, your dynamic dispatch Worker can route requests to any Worker in the namespace. Below are common routing patterns you can implement in your dispatcher.

### Routing examples

#### KV-Based Routing

Store the routing mappings in [Workers KV](https://developers.cloudflare.com/kv/). This allows you to modify your routing logic without requiring you to change or redeploy the dynamic dispatch Worker.

```js
export default {
	async fetch(request, env) {
		try {
			const url = new URL(request.url);

			// Use hostname, path, or any combination as the routing key
			const routingKey = url.hostname;

			// Lookup user Worker name from KV store
			const userWorkerName = await env.USER_ROUTING.get(routingKey);

			if (!userWorkerName) {
				return new Response("Route not configured", { status: 404 });
			}

			// Optional: Cache the KV lookup result
			const userWorker = env.DISPATCHER.get(userWorkerName);
			return await userWorker.fetch(request);
		} catch (e) {
			if (e.message.startsWith("Worker not found")) {
				return new Response("", { status: 404 });
			}
			return new Response(e.message, { status: 500 });
		}
	},
};
```

#### Subdomain-Based Routing

Route subdomains to the corresponding Worker. For example, `my-customer.example.com` will route to the Worker named `my-customer` in the dispatch namespace.

```js
export default {
	async fetch(request, env) {
		try {
			// Extract user Worker name from subdomain
			// Example: customer1.example.com -> customer1
			const url = new URL(request.url);
			const userWorkerName = url.hostname.split(".")[0];

			// Get user Worker from dispatch namespace
			const userWorker = env.DISPATCHER.get(userWorkerName);
			return await userWorker.fetch(request);
		} catch (e) {
			if (e.message.startsWith("Worker not found")) {
				// User Worker doesn't exist in dispatch namespace
				return new Response("", { status: 404 });
			}
			// Could be any other exception from fetch() or from the dispatched Worker
			return new Response(e.message, { status: 500 });
		}
	},
};
```

#### Path-Based routing

Route URL paths to the corresponding Worker. For example, `example.com/customer-1` will route to the Worker named `customer-1` in the dispatch namespace.

```js
export default {
	async fetch(request, env) {
		try {
			const url = new URL(request.url);
			const pathParts = url.pathname.split("/").filter(Boolean);

			if (pathParts.length === 0) {
				return new Response("Invalid path", { status: 400 });
			}

			// example.com/customer-1 -> routes to 'customer-1' worker
			const userWorkerName = pathParts[0];

			const userWorker = env.DISPATCHER.get(userWorkerName);
			return await userWorker.fetch(request);
		} catch (e) {
			if (e.message.startsWith("Worker not found")) {
				return new Response("", { status: 404 });
			}
			return new Response(e.message, { status: 500 });
		}
	},
};
```

### Enforce custom limits

Use [custom limits](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-for-platforms/workers-for-platforms/configuration/custom-limits/) to control how much CPU time a given user Worker can use, or how many subrequests it can make. You can set different limits based on customer plan type or other criteria.

```js
export default {
	async fetch(request, env) {
		try {
			const url = new URL(request.url);
			const userWorkerName = url.hostname.split(".")[0];

			// Look up customer plan from your database or KV
			const customerPlan = await env.CUSTOMERS.get(userWorkerName);

			// Set limits based on plan type
			const plans = {
				enterprise: { cpuMs: 50, subRequests: 50 },
				pro: { cpuMs: 20, subRequests: 20 },
				free: { cpuMs: 10, subRequests: 5 },
			};
			const limits = plans[customerPlan] || plans.free;

			const userWorker = env.DISPATCHER.get(userWorkerName, {}, { limits });
			return await userWorker.fetch(request);
		} catch (e) {
			if (e.message.startsWith("Worker not found")) {
				return new Response("", { status: 404 });
			}
			if (e.message.includes("CPU time limit")) {
				// Track limit violations with Analytics Engine
				env.ANALYTICS.writeDataPoint({
					indexes: [userWorkerName],
					blobs: ["cpu_limit_exceeded"],
				});
				return new Response("CPU limit exceeded", { status: 429 });
			}
			return new Response(e.message, { status: 500 });
		}
	},
};
```

For more details on available limits, refer to [Custom limits](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-for-platforms/workers-for-platforms/configuration/custom-limits/).

To track limit violations and other metrics across user Workers, use [Workers Analytics Engine](https://developers.cloudflare.com/analytics/analytics-engine/). For detailed logging and debugging, configure a [Tail Worker](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/observability/logs/tail-workers/) to capture events from your dispatch Worker.
