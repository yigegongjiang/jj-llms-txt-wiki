# Tags

Last updated Apr 21, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-for-platforms/workers-for-platforms/configuration/tags/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Use tags to organize, search, and filter user Workers at scale. Tag Workers based on customer ID, plan type, project ID, or environment. After you tag user Workers, you can perform bulk operations like deleting all Workers for a specific customer.

Note

You can set a maximum of eight tags per script. Avoid special characters like `,` and `&` when naming your tag.

## Add tags via dashboard

1. Go to **Workers for Platforms** in the Cloudflare dashboard and select your namespace.
2. Select a user Worker from the list.
3. Go to **Settings** \> **Tags**.
4. Add your tags (for example, `customer-123`, `pro-plan`, `production`).
5. Select **Save**.

You can also search and filter Workers by tags in the namespace view.
