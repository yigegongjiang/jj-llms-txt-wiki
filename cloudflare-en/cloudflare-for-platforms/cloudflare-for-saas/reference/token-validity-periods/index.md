# Token validity periods

Last updated Apr 15, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/reference/token-validity-periods/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

When you perform [TXT](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/security/certificate-management/issue-and-validate/validate-certificates/txt/) domain control validation, you will need to share these tokens with your customers.

However, these tokens expire after a certain amount of time, depending on your chosen certificate authority.

| Certificate authority | Token validity |
| --------------------- | -------------- |
| Let's Encrypt         | 7 days         |
| Google Trust Services | 14 days        |
| SSL.com               | 14 days        |

Caution

Tokens may also become invalid upon validation failure. For more details, refer to [Domain control validation flow](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/edge-certificates/changing-dcv-method/dcv-flow/#dcv-tokens).
