# Workers as your fallback origin

Last updated Jun 19, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/start/advanced-settings/worker-as-origin/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

If you are building your application on [Cloudflare Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/), you can use a Worker as the origin for your SaaS zone (also known as your fallback origin).

## How custom hostname traffic reaches your Worker

When customers point their domains to your SaaS zone (for example, `mystore.customer.com` CNAMEs to `service.saasprovider.com`), their traffic enters your Cloudflare zone. Any Worker routes configured on your zone will match this incoming traffic.

For example, if you have:

* Your SaaS zone: `saasprovider.com`
* Your fallback origin: `service.saasprovider.com`
* Customer's custom hostname: `mystore.customer.com` (pointed to your zone via CNAME)
* Worker route: `*/*`

When a visitor requests `mystore.customer.com`, Cloudflare routes that request through your zone. The `*/*` route pattern matches all traffic entering your zone, including traffic from custom hostnames like `mystore.customer.com`.

Note

You do not need to add individual Worker routes for each custom hostname. The wildcard route pattern (`*/*`) automatically captures all traffic entering your zone, including traffic from customer vanity domains.

## Set up a Worker as your fallback origin

1. In your SaaS zone, [create and set a fallback origin](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/start/getting-started/#1-create-fallback-origin). Ensure the fallback origin only has an [originless DNS record](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/manage-dns-records/how-to/create-dns-records/#originless-setups):

  * **Example**: `service.example.com AAAA 100::`
2. In that same zone, navigate to **Workers Routes**.
3. Click **Add route**.
4. Configure a route to send traffic to your Worker. Choose one of the following options based on your needs:

  * **Route all traffic to the Worker** (recommended for most SaaS applications):

    * **Route**: `*/*`
    * **Worker**: Select the Worker used for your SaaS application.  
  This pattern routes all traffic entering your zone to the Worker, including requests from custom hostnames (for example, `mystore.customer.com`) and requests to your own subdomains (for example, `app.saasprovider.com`).
  * **Route all but specific routes to worker**:

    * **Route**: `*/*`
    * **Worker**: Select the Worker used for your SaaS application.
    * Add a second route for your zone's own hostnames with **Worker** set to **None** to exclude them.  
  For example, if your zone is `saasprovider.com` and you want `api.saasprovider.com` to bypass the Worker, create an additional route `api.saasprovider.com/*` with no Worker assigned. More specific routes take precedence over wildcard routes.
  * **Route only custom hostname traffic to the Worker**:
  * **Route**: `vanity.customer.com`
  * **Worker**: Select the Worker used for your SaaS application.
5. Click **Save**.

Zone name restriction

Do not configure a custom hostname which matches the zone name. For example, if your SaaS zone is `example.com`, do not create a custom hostname named `example.com`.

## Interaction with custom origin server

Caution

When a Worker route matches incoming traffic, the request is handled by the Worker. The [custom\_origin\_server](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/start/advanced-settings/custom-origin/) setting on individual custom hostnames is bypassed because the Worker processes the request before origin resolution occurs.

If you need per-hostname origin routing, implement it within your Worker using `request.headers.get("host")` or `request.cf.hostMetadata` (via [custom metadata](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/domain-support/custom-metadata/)).
