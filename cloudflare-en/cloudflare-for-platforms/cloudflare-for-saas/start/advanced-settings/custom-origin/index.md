# Custom origin server

Last updated Jun 19, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/start/advanced-settings/custom-origin/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

A **custom origin server** lets you send traffic from one or more custom hostnames to somewhere besides your default proxy fallback, such as:

* `soap.stores.com` goes to `origin1.com`
* `towel.stores.com` goes to `origin2.com`

## Requirements

To use a custom origin server, you need to meet the following requirements:

* Each custom origin needs to be a valid hostname with a proxied (orange-clouded) A, AAAA, or CNAME record in your account's DNS. You cannot use an IP address.
* The DNS record for the custom origin server does not currently support wildcard values.

## Use a custom origin

To use a custom origin, select that option when [creating a new custom hostname](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/security/certificate-management/issue-and-validate/) in the dashboard or include the `"custom_origin_server": your_custom_origin_server` parameter when using the API [POST command](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/custom%5Fhostnames/methods/create/).

## Cloud provider origins (Azure, AWS, GCP)

When using a cloud provider endpoint as a custom origin (for example, Azure App Service, AWS ALB, or GCP Cloud Run), the provider may reject requests with a `404` or `400` error if the `Host` header does not match a domain configured on that endpoint.

By default, Cloudflare sends the original custom hostname as the `Host` header. If your cloud provider expects a different hostname:

1. Configure the cloud provider to accept the custom hostname as a valid domain, or
2. Use an [Origin Rule](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/origin-rules/) to override the `Host` header to match the hostname your cloud provider expects.

Note

This is a common issue with Azure App Service, where the platform returns a default parking page (404) when the incoming `Host` header does not match any configured custom domain.

## SNI rewrites

Note

Only certain customers have access to this feature. For more details, see the [Plans page](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/plans/).

When Cloudflare establishes a connection to your default origin server, the `Host` header and SNI will both be the value of the original custom hostname.

However, if you configure that custom hostname with a custom origin, the value of the SNI will be that of the custom origin and the `Host` header will be the original custom hostname. Since these values will not match, you will not be able to use the [Full (strict)](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/origin-configuration/ssl-modes/full-strict/) on your origins.

To solve this problem, you can contact your account team to request an entitlement for **SNI rewrites**.

### SNI rewrite options

Choose how your custom hostname populates the SNI value with SNI rewrites:

* **Origin server name** (default): Set SNI to the custom origin

  * If custom origin is `custom-origin.example.com`, then the SNI is `custom-origin.example.com`.
* **Host header**: Set SNI to the host header (or a host header override)

  * If wildcards are not enabled and the hostname is `example.com`, then the SNI is `example.com`.
  * If wildcards are enabled, the hostname is `example.com`, and a request comes to `www.example.com`, then the SNI is `www.example.com`.
* **Subdomain of zone**: Choose what to set as the SNI value (custom hostname or any subdomain)

  * If wildcards are not enabled and a request comes to `example.com`, choose whether to set the SNI as `example.com` or `www.example.com`.
  * If wildcards are enabled, you set the SNI to `example.com`, and a request comes to `www.example.com`, then the SNI is `example.com`.

Important

* Currently, SNI Rewrite is not supported for wildcard custom hostnames. Subdomains covered by a wildcard custom hostname send the custom origin server name as the SNI value.
* In the [O2O context](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/saas-customers/how-it-works/) (when requests are originating from a proxied hostname on a zone also on Cloudflare), changing the SNI value to use host header is currently not supported.
* SNI overrides defined in an [Origin Rule](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/origin-rules/) will take precedence over SNI rewrites.
* SNI Rewrite usage is subject to the [Service-Specific Terms ↗](https://www.cloudflare.com/service-specific-terms-application-services/#ssl-for-saas-terms).

### Set an SNI rewrite

To set an SNI rewrite in the dashboard, choose your preferred option from **Origin SNI value** when [creating a custom hostname](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/security/certificate-management/issue-and-validate/).

To set an SNI rewrite via the API, set the `custom_origin_sni` parameter when [creating a custom hostname](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/custom%5Fhostnames/methods/create/):

* **Custom origin name** (default): Applies if you do not set the parameter
* **Host header**: Specify `":request_host_header:"`
* **Subdomain of zone**: Set to `"example.com"` or another subdomain of the custom hostname
