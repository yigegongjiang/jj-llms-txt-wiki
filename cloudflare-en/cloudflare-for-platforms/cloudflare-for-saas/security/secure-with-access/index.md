# Secure with Cloudflare Access

Last updated May 6, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/security/secure-with-access/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Cloudflare Access provides visibility and control over who has access to your [custom hostnames](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/domain-support/). You can allow or block users based on identity, device posture, and other [Access rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/access-controls/policies/).

## Prerequisites

* You must have an active custom hostname. For setup instructions, refer to [Configuring Cloudflare for SaaS](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/start/getting-started/).
* You must have a Cloudflare Zero Trust plan in your SaaS provider account. Learn more about [getting started with Zero Trust](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/setup/).
* You can only run Access on custom hostnames if they are managed externally to Cloudflare or in a separate Cloudflare account. If the custom hostname zone is in the same account as the SaaS zone, the Access application will not be applied.

## Setup

1. In the [Cloudflare dashboard ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/), select your SaaS provider account and go to **Zero Trust** \> **Access controls** \> **Applications**.
2. Select **Create new application**.
3. Select **Self-hosted and private**.
4. Select **Add public hostname**.
5. Select **Switch to custom input**.
6. In **Hostname**, enter your custom hostname (for example, `mycustomhostname.com`).
7. Follow the remaining [self-hosted application creation steps](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/access-controls/applications/http-apps/self-hosted-public-app/) to publish the application.
