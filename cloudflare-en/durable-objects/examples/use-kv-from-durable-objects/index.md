# Use Workers KV from Durable Objects

Read and write to/from Workers KV within a Durable Object

Last updated Apr 21, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/examples/use-kv-from-durable-objects/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

The following Worker script shows you how to configure a Durable Object to read from and/or write to a [Workers KV namespace](https://developers.cloudflare.com/kv/concepts/how-kv-works/). This is useful when using a Durable Object to coordinate between multiple clients, and allows you to serialize writes to KV and/or broadcast a single read from KV to hundreds or thousands of clients connected to a single Durable Object [using WebSockets](https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/best-practices/websockets/).

Prerequisites:

* A [KV namespace](https://developers.cloudflare.com/kv/api/) created via the Cloudflare dashboard or the [wrangler CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/).
* A [configured binding](https://developers.cloudflare.com/kv/concepts/kv-bindings/) for the `kv_namespace` in the Cloudflare dashboard or Wrangler file.
* A [Durable Object namespace binding](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/#durable-objects).

Configure your Wrangler file as follows:

```jsonc
{
	"$schema": "./node_modules/wrangler/config-schema.json",
	"name": "my-worker",
	"main": "src/index.ts",
	"kv_namespaces": [
		{
			"binding": "YOUR_KV_NAMESPACE",
			"id": "<id_of_your_namespace>"
		}
	],
	"durable_objects": {
		"bindings": [
			{
				"name": "YOUR_DO_CLASS",
				"class_name": "YourDurableObject"
			}
		]
	}
}
```

```toml
"$schema" = "./node_modules/wrangler/config-schema.json"
name = "my-worker"
main = "src/index.ts"

[[kv_namespaces]]
binding = "YOUR_KV_NAMESPACE"
id = "<id_of_your_namespace>"

[[durable_objects.bindings]]
name = "YOUR_DO_CLASS"
class_name = "YourDurableObject"
```

```ts
import { DurableObject } from "cloudflare:workers";

interface Env {
	YOUR_KV_NAMESPACE: KVNamespace;
	YOUR_DO_CLASS: DurableObjectNamespace;
}

export default {
	async fetch(req: Request, env: Env): Promise<Response> {
		// Assume each Durable Object is mapped to a roomId in a query parameter
		// In a production application, this will likely be a roomId defined by your application
		// that you validate (and/or authenticate) first.
		let url = new URL(req.url);
		let roomIdParam = url.searchParams.get("roomId");

		if (roomIdParam) {
			// Get a stub that allows you to call that Durable Object
			let durableObjectStub = env.YOUR_DO_CLASS.getByName(roomIdParam);

			// Pass the request to that Durable Object and await the response
			// This invokes the constructor once on your Durable Object class (defined further down)
			// on the first initialization, and the fetch method on each request.
			//
			// You could pass the original Request to the Durable Object's fetch method
			// or a simpler URL with just the roomId.
			let response = await durableObjectStub.fetch(`http://do/${roomId}`);

			// This would return the value you read from KV *within* the Durable Object.
			return response;
		}
	},
};

export class YourDurableObject extends DurableObject {
	constructor(
		public state: DurableObjectState,
		env: Env,
	) {
		super(state, env);
	}

	async fetch(request: Request) {
		// Error handling elided for brevity.
		// Write to KV
		await this.env.YOUR_KV_NAMESPACE.put("some-key");

		// Fetch from KV
		let val = await this.env.YOUR_KV_NAMESPACE.get("some-other-key");

		return Response.json(val);
	}
}
```

```py
from workers import DurableObject, Response, WorkerEntrypoint
from urllib.parse import urlparse, parse_qs

class Default(WorkerEntrypoint):
	async def fetch(self, req):
		# Assume each Durable Object is mapped to a roomId in a query parameter
		# In a production application, this will likely be a roomId defined by your application
		# that you validate (and/or authenticate) first.
		url = req.url
		parsed_url = urlparse(url)
		room_id_param = parse_qs(parsed_url.query).get('roomId', [None])[0]

		if room_id_param:
			# Get a stub that allows you to call that Durable Object
			durable_object_stub = self.env.YOUR_DO_CLASS.getByName(room_id_param)

			# Pass the request to that Durable Object and await the response
			# This invokes the constructor once on your Durable Object class (defined further down)
			# on the first initialization, and the fetch method on each request.
			#
			# You could pass the original Request to the Durable Object's fetch method
			# or a simpler URL with just the roomId.
			response = await durable_object_stub.fetch(f"http://do/{room_id_param}")

			# This would return the value you read from KV *within* the Durable Object.
			return response

class YourDurableObject(DurableObject):
	def __init__(self, state, env):
		super().__init__(state, env)

	async def fetch(self, request):
		# Error handling elided for brevity.
		# Write to KV
		await self.env.YOUR_KV_NAMESPACE.put("some-key", "some-value")

		# Fetch from KV
		val = await self.env.YOUR_KV_NAMESPACE.get("some-other-key")

		return Response.json(val)
```
