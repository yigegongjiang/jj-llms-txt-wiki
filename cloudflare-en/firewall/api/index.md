# Manage rules via the APIs

Last updated Apr 24, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/firewall/api/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Cloudflare offers APIs that work together to achieve the same effect as the UI-based **Firewall rules** feature under **Security** \> **WAF**.

Deprecation notice

Cloudflare Firewall Rules has been deprecated. Cloudflare has moved existing firewall rules to [WAF custom rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/custom-rules/). For more information on this change, refer to the [upgrade guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/reference/legacy/firewall-rules-upgrade/).

These APIs are the following:

* [**Firewall Rules API**](https://developers.cloudflare.com/firewall/api/cf-firewall-rules/): Manage firewall rules and their actions, based on criteria separately defined through filters.
* [**Filters API**](https://developers.cloudflare.com/firewall/api/cf-filters/): Manage the filters that enable rule matching.
* [**Lists API**](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/tools/lists/lists-api/): Manage named lists of items (such as IP addresses) that you can use in the rules of different Cloudflare products.
