# Endpoints

Last updated Apr 24, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/firewall/api/cf-filters/endpoints/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

To invoke a Cloudflare Filters API operation, append the endpoint to the Cloudflare API base URL:

```txt
https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/
```

For authentication instructions, refer to [Getting Started: Requests](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/) in the Cloudflare API documentation.

For help with endpoints and pagination, refer to [Getting Started: Endpoints](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/).

Note

The Filters API endpoints require a value for `<ZONE_ID>`.

To retrieve a list of zones associated with your account, use the [List Zones](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/zones/methods/list/) operation and note the Zone ID associated with the domain for which you want to manage filters.

The Cloudflare Filters API supports the operations outlined below. Visit the pages in this section for examples.
