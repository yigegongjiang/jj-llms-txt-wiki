# Cloudflare Firewall Rules

Last updated Aug 14, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/firewall/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Cloudflare Firewall Rules allows you to create rules that inspect incoming traffic and block, challenge, log, or allow specific requests.

Deprecation notice

Cloudflare Firewall Rules has been deprecated. Cloudflare has moved existing firewall rules to [WAF custom rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/custom-rules/). For more information on this change, refer to the [upgrade guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/reference/legacy/firewall-rules-upgrade/).

## Main features

* **Rule-based protection**: Use pre-defined rulesets provided by Cloudflare, or define your own firewall rules. Create rules in the Cloudflare dashboard or via API.
* **Complex custom rules**: Each rule's expression can reference multiple fields from all the available HTTP request parameters and fields, allowing you to create complex rules.
