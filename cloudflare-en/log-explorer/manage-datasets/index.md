# Manage datasets

Last updated Aug 27, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/log-explorer/manage-datasets/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Log Explorer allows you to enable, disable, or delete datasets available to query in Log Search.

Note

Canceling a Log Explorer subscription stops renewal, but it does not automatically stop log ingestion during the current billing cycle. To completely turn off Log Explorer, refer to [How do I turn off Log Explorer?](https://developers.cloudflare.com/log-explorer/faq/#how-do-i-turn-off-log-explorer).

## Supported datasets

Log Explorer currently supports the following datasets:

## Enable Log Explorer

In order for Log Explorer to begin storing logs, you need to enable the desired datasets. You can do this via the dashboard or the API.

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Log Explorer** \> **Manage datasets** page.  
[Go to **Manage datasets** ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/log-explorer/manage-sources)
2. Select **Add dataset** to select the datasets you want to query.
3. Choose a dataset and then a zone. Then, select **Add**. You can always return to this page to enable more datasets or manage your existing ones.

Note

It may take a few minutes for the logs to become available for querying.

If you are using the API, Use the Log Explorer API to enable Log Explorer for each dataset you wish to store. It may take a few minutes after a log stream is enabled before you can view the logs.

The following `curl` command is an example for enabling the zone-level dataset `http_requests`, as well as the expected response when the command succeeds.

```bash
curl https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/{zone_id}/logs/explorer/datasets \
--header "Authorization: Bearer <API_TOKEN>" \
--json '{
  "dataset": "http_requests"
}'
```

```json
{
	"result": {
		"dataset": "http_requests",
		"object_type": "zone",
		"object_id": "<ZONE ID>",
		"created_at": "2025-06-03T14:33:16Z",
		"updated_at": "2025-06-03T14:33:16Z",
		"dataset_id": "01973635f7e273a1964a02f4d4502499",
		"enabled": true,
		"deletion_protection": true
	},
	"success": true,
	"errors": [],
	"messages": []
}
```

To enable an account-level dataset, replace `zones/{zone_id}` with `accounts/{account_id}` in the `curl` command. For example:

```bash
curl https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/{account_id}/logs/explorer/datasets \
--header "Authorization: Bearer <API_TOKEN>" \
--json '{
  "dataset": "access_requests"
}'
```

## Delete a dataset

Deleting a dataset permanently removes the dataset and its stored data. Deletion runs asynchronously. You cannot recreate the same dataset for the account or zone while deletion is in progress.

Caution

Dataset deletion is irreversible. Deleted data cannot be recovered.

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to **Log Explorer** \> **Manage datasets**.  
[Go to **Manage datasets** ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/log-explorer/manage-sources)
2. Find the dataset and select **Actions** \> **Delete**.
3. If deletion protection is enabled, disable it in the confirmation dialog.
4. Enter the dataset name and select **Delete**.

1. Set `deletion_protection` to `false` with the [Update an account or zone dataset](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/logs/subresources/log%5Fexplorer/subresources/datasets/methods/update/) method.
2. Delete the dataset with the [Delete an account or zone dataset](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/logs/subresources/log%5Fexplorer/subresources/datasets/methods/delete/) method.
