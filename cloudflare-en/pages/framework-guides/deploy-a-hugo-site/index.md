# Hugo

Last updated Apr 21, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/framework-guides/deploy-a-hugo-site/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

[Hugo ↗](https://gohugo.io/) is a tool for generating static sites, written in Go. It is incredibly fast and has great high-level, flexible primitives for managing your content using different [content formats ↗](https://gohugo.io/content-management/formats/).

In this guide, you will create a new Hugo application and deploy it using Cloudflare Pages. You will use the `hugo` CLI to create a new Hugo site.

## Before you continue

All of the framework guides assume you already have a fundamental understanding of [Git ↗](https://git-scm.com/). If you are new to Git, refer to this [summarized Git handbook ↗](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) on how to set up Git on your local machine.

If you clone with SSH, you must [generate SSH keys ↗](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) on each computer you use to push or pull from GitHub.

Refer to the [GitHub documentation ↗](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) and [Git documentation ↗](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) for more information.

Go to [Deploy with Cloudflare Pages](#deploy-with-cloudflare-pages) if you already have a Hugo site hosted with your [Git provider](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/get-started/git-integration/).

## Install Hugo

Install the Hugo CLI, using the specific instructions for your operating system.

If you use the package manager [Homebrew ↗](https://brew.sh), run the `brew install` command in your terminal to install Hugo:

```sh
brew install hugo
```

If you use the package manager [Chocolatey ↗](https://chocolatey.org/), run the `choco install` command in your terminal to install Hugo:

```sh
choco install hugo --confirm
```

If you use the package manager [Scoop ↗](https://scoop.sh/), run the `scoop install` command in your terminal to install Hugo:

```sh
scoop install hugo
```

The package manager for your Linux distribution may include Hugo. If this is the case, install Hugo directly using the distribution's package manager — for instance, in Ubuntu, run the following command:

```sh
sudo apt-get install hugo
```

If your package manager does not include Hugo or you would like to download a release directly, refer to the [**Manual**](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/framework-guides/deploy-a-hugo-site/#manual-installation) section.

### Manual installation

The Hugo GitHub repository contains pre-built versions of the Hugo command-line tool for various operating systems, which can be found on [the Releases page ↗](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases).

For more instruction on installing these releases, refer to [Hugo's documentation ↗](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/).

## Create a new project

With Hugo installed, refer to [Hugo's Quick Start ↗](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/) to create your project or create a new project by running the `hugo new` command in your terminal:

```sh
hugo new site my-hugo-site
```

Hugo sites use themes to customize the look and feel of the statically built HTML site. There are a number of themes available at [themes.gohugo.io ↗](https://themes.gohugo.io) — for now, use the [Ananke theme ↗](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/gohugo-theme-ananke/) by running the following commands in your terminal:

```sh
cd my-hugo-site
git init
git submodule add https://github.com/theNewDynamic/gohugo-theme-ananke.git themes/ananke
echo "theme = 'ananke'" >> hugo.toml
```

## Create a post

Create a new post to give your Hugo site some initial content. Run the `hugo new` command in your terminal to generate a new post:

```sh
hugo new content posts/hello-world.md
```

Inside of `hello-world.md`, add some initial content to create your post. Remove the `draft` line in your post's frontmatter when you are ready to publish the post. Any posts with `draft: true` set will be skipped by Hugo's build process.

## Create a GitHub repository

Create a new GitHub repository by visiting [repo.new ↗](https://repo.new). After creating a new repository, go to your newly created project directory to prepare and push your local application to GitHub by running the following commands in your terminal:

```sh
git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-gh-username>/<repository-name>
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Deploy with Cloudflare Pages

To deploy your site to Pages:

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Workers & Pages** page.  
[Go to **Workers & Pages** ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/workers-and-pages)
2. Select **Create application**.
3. Select the **Pages** tab.
4. Select **Import an existing Git repository**.
5. Select the new GitHub repository that you created and then select **Begin setup**.
6. In the **Set up builds and deployments** section, provide the following information:

| Configuration option | Value  | |  Production branch | main |
| -------------------- | ------ | -------------------- | ---- |
| Build command        | hugo   |                      |      |
| Build directory      | public |                      |      |

While `public` is the default build directory for Hugo sites, this setting can be configured with the [publishDir setting ↗](https://gohugo.io/configuration/all/#publishdir).

Base URL configuration

Hugo allows you to configure the `baseURL` of your application. This allows you to utilize the `absURL` helper to construct full canonical URLs. In order to do this with Pages, you must provide the `-b` or `--baseURL` flags with the `CF_PAGES_URL` environment variable to your `hugo` build command.

Your final build command may look like this:

```sh
hugo -b $CF_PAGES_URL
```

After completing deployment configuration, select the **Save and Deploy**. You should see Cloudflare Pages installing `hugo` and your project dependencies, and building your site, before deploying it.

Note

For the complete guide to deploying your first site to Cloudflare Pages, refer to the [Get started guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/get-started/).

After deploying your site, you will receive a unique subdomain for your project on `*.pages.dev`. Every time you commit new code to your Hugo site, Cloudflare Pages will automatically rebuild your project and deploy it. You will also get access to [preview deployments](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/configuration/preview-deployments/) on new pull requests, so you can preview how changes look to your site before deploying them to production.

## Use a specific or newer Hugo version

To use a [specific or newer version of Hugo ↗](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases), create the `HUGO_VERSION` environment variable in your Pages project > **Settings** \> **Environment variables**. Set the value as the Hugo version you want to specify (see the [Prerequisites ↗](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/#prerequisites) for the minimum recommended version).

For example, `HUGO_VERSION`: `0.128.0`.

Note

If you plan to use [preview deployments](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/configuration/preview-deployments/), make sure you also add environment variables to your **Preview** environment.
