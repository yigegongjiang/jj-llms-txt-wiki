# hCaptcha

Last updated Apr 21, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/functions/plugins/hcaptcha/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

The hCaptcha Pages Plugin validates hCaptcha tokens.

## Installation

npmyarnpnpmbun

```
npm i @cloudflare/pages-plugin-hcaptcha
```

```
yarn add @cloudflare/pages-plugin-hcaptcha
```

```
pnpm add @cloudflare/pages-plugin-hcaptcha
```

```
bun add @cloudflare/pages-plugin-hcaptcha
```

## Usage

```typescript
import hCaptchaPlugin from "@cloudflare/pages-plugin-hcaptcha";

export const onRequestPost: PagesFunction[] = [
	hCaptchaPlugin({
		secret: "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
		sitekey: "10000000-ffff-ffff-ffff-000000000001",
	}),
	async (context) => {
		// Request has been validated as coming from a human

		const formData = await context.request.formData();

		// Store user credentials

		return new Response("Successfully registered!");
	},
];
```

This Plugin only exposes a single route. It will be available wherever it is mounted. In the above example, because it is mounted in `functions/register.ts`, it will validate requests to `/register`. The Plugin is mounted with a single object parameter with the following properties.

[secret ↗](https://dashboard.hcaptcha.com/settings) (mandatory) and [sitekey ↗](https://dashboard.hcaptcha.com/sites) (optional) can both be found in your hCaptcha dashboard.

`response` and `remoteip` are optional strings. `response` the hCaptcha token to verify (defaults to extracting `h-captcha-response` from a `multipart/form-data` request). `remoteip` should be requester's IP address (defaults to the `CF-Connecting-IP` header of the request).

`onError` is an optional function which takes the Pages Function context object and returns a `Promise` of a `Response`. By default, it will return a human-readable error `Response`.

`data.hCaptcha` will be populated in subsequent Pages Functions (including for the `onError` function) with [the hCaptcha response object ↗](https://docs.hcaptcha.com/#verify-the-user-response-server-side).
