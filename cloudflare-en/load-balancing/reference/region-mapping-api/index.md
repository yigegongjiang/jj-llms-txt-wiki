# Regions API

Last updated Apr 16, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/load-balancing/reference/region-mapping-api/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Cloudflare’s Load Balancing Regions API has several uses:

* Identify which countries/areas (states/provinces in the case of the U.S. and Canada) are part of a specific Cloudflare Load Balancer region.
* Identify the Cloudflare Load Balancer region for a particular country/area (states/provinces in the case of the U.S. and Canada).

The Region API uses 2-letter [ISO-3166-1 alpha-2 codes ↗](https://www.iso.org/iso-3166-country-codes.html) for countries/areas and, in the case of the U.S. and Canada, ISO-3166-2 subdivision codes for states/provinces. Only the U.S. and Canada are provided with these subdivisions.

There are two main optional parameters for the Region API:

* country\_code is a string containing a two-letter alpha-2 country code per ISO 3166-1\. For example: /load\_balancers/regions?country\_code=US
* subdivision\_code is a string containing a two-letter subdivision code for the U.S. and Canada per ISO 3166-2\. For example: /load\_balancers/regions?subdivision\_code=CA

For additional details and examples on using the Region Mapping API, see [Cloudflare’s API documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/load%5Fbalancers/subresources/regions/methods/list/).
