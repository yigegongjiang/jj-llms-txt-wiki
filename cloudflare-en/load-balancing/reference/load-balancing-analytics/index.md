# Analytics

Last updated Apr 17, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/load-balancing/reference/load-balancing-analytics/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Using load balancing analytics, you can:

* Evaluate traffic flow.
* Assess the health status of endpoints in your pools.
* Review changes in pools and pool health over time.

Note

Load balancing analytics are only available to customers on paid plans (Pro, Business, and Enterprise).

## Dashboard Analytics

### Overview metrics

To view **Overview** metrics for your load balancer, go to **Traffic** \> **Load Balancing Analytics**.

These metrics show the number of requests routed to specific pools within a load balancer, helping you:

* Evaluate the effects of adding or removing a pool.
* Decide when to create new pools.
* Plan for peak traffic demands and future infrastructure needs.

Add additional filters for specific pools, times, regions, and endpoints.

Note

Load balancing **requests** are the number of uncached requests made by your load balancer. By default, Cloudflare caches resolved IP addresses for up to five seconds.

### Latency

**Latency** metrics show an interactive map, helping you identify regions with **Unhealthy** or **Slow** pools.

To view latency information for your load balancer, go to **Traffic** \> **Load Balancing Analytics** \> **Latency**.

### Logs

**Logs** provide a history of all endpoint status changes and how they affect your load balancing pools. Load Balancing only logs events that represent a status change for an endpoint, from healthy to unhealthy or vice versa.

When a Monitor Group is attached to a pool, each logged health event includes the `monitors` field. This field lists the individual monitors within the group and their results, making it easier to see which monitor contributed to a status change.

Example event (truncated):

```json
{
	"id": <id>,
	"timestamp": "2025-09-22 19:22:00",
	"pool": {
		"id": "<id>",
		"name": "example-monitor-group-test-pool-us",
		"healthy": true,
		"changed": false,
		"minimum_origins": 1
	},
	"origins": [
		{
			"name": "origin-a",
			"ip": "192.0.2.10",
			"enabled": true,
			"healthy": true,
			"failure_reason": "No failures",
			"response_code": 200,
			"monitors": [
				{
					"id": "<id>",
					"healthy": true,
					"failure_reason": "No failures",
					"response_code": 200,
					"must_be_healthy": true,
					"monitoring_only": false
				},
				{
					"id": "<id>",
					"healthy": true,
					"failure_reason": "No failures",
					"response_code": 200,
					"must_be_healthy": true,
					"monitoring_only": false
				},
				{
					"id": "<id>",
					"healthy": false,
					"failure_reason": "HTTP timeout occurred",
					"must_be_healthy": false,
					"monitoring_only": true
				}
			]
		},
		{
			"name": "origin-b",
			"ip": "198.51.100.25",
			"enabled": true,
			"healthy": false,
			"failure_reason": "TCP connection failed",
			"changed": true,
			"monitors": [
				{
					"id": "<id>",
					"healthy": false,
					"failure_reason": "TCP connection failed",
					"must_be_healthy": true,
					"monitoring_only": false
				},
				{
					"id": "<id>",
					"healthy": true,
					"failure_reason": "No failures",
					"response_code": 200,
					"must_be_healthy": true,
					"monitoring_only": false
				},
				{
					"id": "<id>",
					"healthy": false,
					"failure_reason": "HTTP timeout occurred",
					"must_be_healthy": false,
					"monitoring_only": true
				}
			]
		}
	]
}
```

In this example:

* Each origin includes a `monitors` array listing all monitors within the attached group.
* Fields such as `must_be_healthy` `and monitoring_only` indicate each monitor's role in determining the origin's overall health.
* The `healthy` and `failure_reason` fields show which individual monitor checks succeeded or failed.

To access logs in the dashboard, go to **Traffic** \> **Load Balancing Analytics**.

## GraphQL Analytics

For more flexibility, get load balancing metrics directly from the [GraphQL Analytics API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/analytics/graphql-api/).

Get started with a sample query:

Requests per pool

This query shows the number of requests each pool receives from each location in Cloudflare's global network.

```graphql
query RequestsPerPool($zoneTag: string, $start: Time, $end: Time) {
	viewer {
		zones(filter: { zoneTag: $zoneTag }) {
			loadBalancingRequestsAdaptiveGroups(
				limit: 100
				filter: {
					datetime_geq: $start
					datetime_leq: $end
					lbName: "lb.example.com"
				}
				orderBy: [datetimeFifteenMinutes_DESC]
			) {
				count
				dimensions {
					datetimeFifteenMinutes
					coloCode
					selectedPoolName
				}
			}
		}
	}
}
```

```json
{
    "data": {
        "viewer": {
            "zones": [
                {
                    "loadBalancingRequestsAdaptiveGroups": [
                        {
                            "count": 4,
                            "dimensions": {
                                "coloCode": "IAD",
                                "datetimeFifteenMinutes": "2021-06-26T00:45:00Z",
                                "selectedPoolName": "us-east"
                            }
                        },
                        ...
                    ]
                }
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

Requests per data center

This query shows the weighted, round-trip time (RTT) measurement (`avgRttMs`) for monitor requests from a specific data center (for example, Singapore or `SIN`) to each pool in a specific load balancer.

Caution

Note that `avgRttMs` refers to the round-trip time that is measured by the monitors and used in steering decisions. `avgRttMs` is different from the raw RTT for individual requests that reach the Cloudflare network.

```graphql
query RequestsPerDataCenter($zoneTag: string, $start: Time, $end: Time) {
	viewer {
		zones(filter: { zoneTag: $zoneTag }) {
			loadBalancingRequestsAdaptive(
				limit: 100
				filter: {
					datetime_geq: $start
					datetime_leq: $end
					lbName: "lb.example.com"
					coloCode: "SIN"
				}
				orderBy: [datetime_DESC]
			) {
				selectedPoolName
				pools {
					poolName
					healthy
					healthCheckEnabled
					avgRttMs
				}
			}
		}
	}
}
```

```json
{
    "data": {
        "viewer": {
            "zones": [
                {
                    "loadBalancingRequestsAdaptive": [
                        {
                            "pools": [
                                {
                                    "avgRttMs": 67,
                                    "healthCheckEnabled": 1,
                                    "healthy": 1,
                                    "poolName": "asia-ne"
                                },
                                {
                                    "avgRttMs": 156,
                                    "healthCheckEnabled": 1,
                                    "healthy": 1,
                                    "poolName": "us-east_and_asia-ne"
                                },
                                {
                                    "avgRttMs": 237,
                                    "healthCheckEnabled": 1,
                                    "healthy": 1,
                                    "poolName": "us-east"
                                },
                            ],
                            "selectedPoolName": "asia-ne"
                        },
                    ...
                    ]
                }
            ]
        }
    }
}
```
