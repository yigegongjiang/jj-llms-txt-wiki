# Pools

Last updated Apr 16, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/load-balancing/pools/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Within Cloudflare, pools represent your endpoints and how they are organized. As such, a pool can be a group of several endpoints, or you could also have only one endpoint (an origin server, for example) per pool.

If you are familiar with DNS terminology, think of a pool as a “record set,” except Cloudflare only returns addresses that are considered healthy. You can attach health monitors to individual pools for customized monitoring. A pool can have either a single monitor or a monitor group attached — but not both.

For more details about how endpoints and pools become unhealthy, refer to [Endpoint and pool health](https://developers.cloudflare.com/load-balancing/understand-basics/health-details/).

Caution

Since load balancing targets are not limited to origin web servers, the term `endpoints` has been introduced. Refer to [Service-Specific Terms ↗](https://www.cloudflare.com/service-specific-terms-other-terms/) for its use in the context of Cloudflare offerings, and to [load balancing concepts](https://developers.cloudflare.com/load-balancing/understand-basics/load-balancing-components/) or [Reference Architecture](https://developers.cloudflare.com/reference-architecture/architectures/load-balancing/) for use case examples.

On the [Load Balancing API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/load%5Fbalancers/methods/get/), `origin` has been maintained.

## Properties

For an up-to-date list of pool properties, refer to [Pool properties](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/load%5Fbalancers/subresources/pools/methods/list/) in our API documentation.

---

## Create pools

For step-by-step guidance, refer to [Create pools](https://developers.cloudflare.com/load-balancing/pools/create-pool/).

---

## Per-endpoint Host header override

When your application needs specialized routing (`CNAME` setup or custom hosts like Heroku), change the `Host` header used in health monitor requests. For more details, refer to [Override HTTP Host headers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/load-balancing/additional-options/override-http-host-headers/).

## API commands

The Cloudflare API supports the following commands for pools. Examples are given for user-level endpoint but apply to the account-level endpoint as well.
