# Spectrum

Last updated Apr 16, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/load-balancing/additional-options/spectrum/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

You can configure [Spectrum](https://developers.cloudflare.com/spectrum/) with Load Balancing to bring resiliency to your TCP or UDP based applications.

Leverage health monitors, failover, and traffic steering by selecting a load balancer as **Origin** when creating your Spectrum application.

The exact settings will vary depending on your use case. Refer to the following steps to understand the workflow.

---

## Set up

### 1\. Configure your load balancer

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Load Balancing** page.  
[Go to **Load Balancing** ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/load-balancing)
2. Select an account where the Load Balancing add-on is [enabled](https://developers.cloudflare.com/load-balancing/get-started/enable-load-balancing/).
3. Go to **Load Balancing** and select **Create load balancer**.
4. On the **Load Balancer Setup**, select **Public load balancer**
5. Choose the website to which you want to add this load balancer.
6. On the **Hostname** page, define the settings presented and select **Next**.

  * Enter a **Hostname**, which is the DNS name at which the load balancer is available. For more details on record priority, refer to [DNS records for load balancing](https://developers.cloudflare.com/load-balancing/load-balancers/dns-records/).  
  Caution  
  To prevent issues with DNS resolution, the load balancer hostname should be different from the hostname (or domain) you intend to define for your Spectrum application.
  * Keep the orange cloud icon enabled, meaning the load balancer is proxied. This refers to the [proxy mode](https://developers.cloudflare.com/load-balancing/understand-basics/proxy-modes/) and, with Spectrum, traffic is always proxied.
  * Keep **Session Affinity** and **Failover across pools** disabled as these features are not supported with Spectrum.
7. On the **Add a Pool** page, define the settings presented and select **Next**.

  * Select one or more existing pools or [create a new pool](https://developers.cloudflare.com/load-balancing/pools/create-pool/#create-a-pool) [1](#user-content-fn-1).
  * If needed, update the [fallback pool](https://developers.cloudflare.com/load-balancing/understand-basics/health-details/#fallback-pools) [2](#user-content-fn-2).
8. On the **Monitors** page, define the settings presented and select **Next**.

  * Review the monitors attached to your pools.
  * If needed, you can attach an existing monitor or [create a new monitor](https://developers.cloudflare.com/load-balancing/monitors/create-monitor/#create-a-monitor).
9. On the **Traffic Steering** page, choose an option for [Traffic steering](https://developers.cloudflare.com/load-balancing/understand-basics/traffic-steering/steering-policies/) and select **Next**.
10. Keep **Custom Rules** page empty as this feature is not supported with Spectrum.
11. On the **Review** page:
* Review your configuration and make any changes.  
  * If you set traffic steering to **Off**, re-order the pools in your load balancer to adjust the fallback order.
  * If you chose to set traffic steering to Random, you can [set weights to your pools](https://developers.cloudflare.com/load-balancing/understand-basics/traffic-steering/steering-policies/standard-options/#random-steering) (via the [API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/load%5Fbalancers/methods/create/)) to determine the percentage of traffic sent to each pool.
* Choose whether to **Save as Draft** or **Save and Deploy**.

### 2\. Configure your Spectrum application

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Spectrum** page.  
[Go to **Spectrum** ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/:zone/spectrum)
2. Select **Create an Application**. If this is your first time using Spectrum, the **Create an Application** modal appears.
3. Select your **[Application Type](https://developers.cloudflare.com/spectrum/reference/configuration-options/#application-type)**.
4. Under **Domain**, enter the domain that will use Spectrum.
5. Under **Edge Port**, enter the port Cloudflare should use for your application.
6. Under **Origin**, select **Load Balancer**.
7. Select the load balancer you want to use from the dropdown. Disabled load balancers will not show on the **Load Balancer** menu.
8. Select **Add**.

## Limitations

* Load Balancing [session affinity](https://developers.cloudflare.com/load-balancing/understand-basics/session-affinity/), [failover across pools](https://developers.cloudflare.com/load-balancing/understand-basics/adaptive-routing/#failover-across-pools), and [custom rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/load-balancing/additional-options/load-balancing-rules/) are not supported by Spectrum.
* UDP health checks are only available with public monitoring. TCP can be used with both public and private monitoring.

## Footnotes

1. Within Cloudflare, pools represent your endpoints and how they are organized. As such, a pool can be a group of several endpoints, or you could also have only one endpoint (an origin server, for example) per pool. [↩](#user-content-fnref-1)
2. A fallback pool is the pool of last resort. When all pools are disabled or unhealthy, this is where the load balancer will send traffic. [↩](#user-content-fnref-2)
