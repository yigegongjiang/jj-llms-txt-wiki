# Supported fields and operators

Last updated Apr 16, 2026|Copy as Markdown| [View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/load-balancing/additional-options/load-balancing-rules/reference/index.md)| [Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

The fields that are supported by load balancing rules depend on whether Cloudflare proxies the traffic going through your load balancer or not.

If you use the wrong set of fields, you might see unexpected behaviors. For best results, use the fields associated with your traffic's [proxy status](https://developers.cloudflare.com/load-balancing/understand-basics/proxy-modes/).

Also, some Load Balancing rules fields are available on the Expression Builder - as described in [Load Balancing expressions](https://developers.cloudflare.com/load-balancing/additional-options/load-balancing-rules/expressions/#working-with-expressions) - while others can only be configured manually, via API or [Expression Editor](https://developers.cloudflare.com/load-balancing/additional-options/load-balancing-rules/expressions/#expression-editor)

## Expression Builder field sets

Consider the following table to know how the fields available in the [Expression Builder](https://developers.cloudflare.com/load-balancing/additional-options/load-balancing-rules/expressions/#expression-builder) are grouped.

| Field Set | Section in Expression Builder | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Fields supported regardless of proxy](#fields-supported-regardless-of-proxy) | `BOTH` | Values that are always accessible regardless of the load balancer proxy status. |
| [Proxied-only fields](#proxied-only-fields) | `PROXIED ONLY` | Values accessible only when the load balancer is proxied. |
| [Unproxied-only fields](#unproxied-only-fields) | `NON-PROXIED ONLY` | Values accessible only when the load balancer is not proxied (DNS-only traffic). |

## Fields supported regardless of proxy

Regardless of your traffic [proxy status](https://developers.cloudflare.com/load-balancing/understand-basics/proxy-modes/), Load Balancing rules can access values for the following fields:

| Field | Name in Expression Builder | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `cf.load_balancer.name`<br>`Bytes` | `Load Balancer Name` | Represents the name of the load balancer executing these rules. Example value:<br>`lb.example.com` |
| `cf.load_balancer.region`<br>`Bytes` | `Load Balancer Region` | Provides the [region name](https://developers.cloudflare.com/load-balancing/reference/region-mapping-api/#list-of-load-balancer-regions) of the data center processing the request. Example value:<br>`ENAM` |
| `ip.src`<br>`IP address` | `IP Source Address` | If proxied, this field provides the client TCP IP address, which may be adjusted to reflect the actual address of the client by using HTTP headers such as `X-Forwarded-For` or `X-Real-IP` . If unproxied (DNS-only), this field provides the ECS source address, if available. If not available, it provides the client resolver IP address.**Deprecation Warning:** In the future, this field will always be set to the client resolver IP address for unproxied requests. To check for the presence of ECS and use the ECS IP, see the fields [`dns.rr.opt.client`](#field-dns-rr-opt-client) and [`dns.rr.opt.client.addr`](#field-dns-rr-opt-client-addr), respectively. Example value:<br>`1.2.3.4` |
| `ip.src.asnum`<br>`Number` | `AS Number` | The 16-bit or 32-bit integer representing the Autonomous System (AS) number associated with the client IP address. Example value:<br>`13335` |

## Proxied-only fields

If your traffic is proxied through Cloudflare, you have access to all the fields listed under [Fields supported regardless of proxy](#fields-supported-regardless-of-proxy) in addition to the following fields:

## Operators and grouping symbols

- **Comparison operators** specify how values defined in an expression must relate to the actual HTTP request value for the expression to return true.
- **Logical operators** combine two expressions to form a compound expression and use order of precedence to determine how an expression is evaluated.
- **Grouping symbols** allow you to organize expressions, enforce operator precedence, and nest expressions.

For examples and usage, refer to [Operators and grouping symbols](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/rules-language/operators/) in the Rules language documentation.
