# Restrict gateway access

Last updated Apr 16, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/web3/how-to/restrict-gateway-access/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

If you are using a [Web3 gateway](https://developers.cloudflare.com/web3/about/) for internal application calls, you may want to restrict gateway access to specific backend services.

You can achieve this goal by [creating general Access policies](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/access-controls/policies/) to block normal traffic and then [creating service tokens](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/access-controls/service-credentials/service-tokens/) to allow access by your backend service.
