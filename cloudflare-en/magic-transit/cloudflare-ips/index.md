# Cloudflare IPs

Last updated Apr 17, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/magic-transit/cloudflare-ips/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

To use Magic Transit, you need to own a publicly routable IP address block with a minimum size of `/24`. If you do not own a `/24` address block, you can use Magic Transit with a Cloudflare-owned IP address. This option is helpful if you do not meet the `/24` prefix length requirements or want to protect a smaller network.

To protect your network with a Cloudflare IP address, contact your account manager. After you receive your IP address:

* [Create a tunnel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/magic-transit/how-to/configure-tunnel-endpoints/).
* [Set up static routes](https://developers.cloudflare.com/magic-transit/how-to/configure-routes/#configure-static-routes) or [BGP peering (beta)](https://developers.cloudflare.com/magic-transit/how-to/configure-routes/#configure-bgp-routes).
* [Configure health checks](https://developers.cloudflare.com/magic-transit/network-health/run-endpoint-health-checks/).
* Confirm you properly configured [tunnel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/magic-transit/network-health/update-tunnel-health-checks-frequency/) and endpoint health checks.
* Update your infrastructure at your own pace to use the allocated Cloudflare IPs.

When you use a Cloudflare-owned IP space, you do not need a Letter of Agency (LOA). When using Cloudflare-leased IPs, Cloudflare automatically enables [Magic Transit Egress](https://developers.cloudflare.com/magic-transit/reference/egress/), which routes your egress traffic to Cloudflare instead of the Internet. Set up policy-based routing on your end to ensure return traffic routes properly.

## Check your Cloudflare IPs

You can find your leased Anycast IPs for Magic Transit on the dashboard under [**Address space** \> **Leased IPs** ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/ip-addresses/address-space).
