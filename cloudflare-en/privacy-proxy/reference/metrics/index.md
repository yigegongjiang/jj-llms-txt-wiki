# Observability

Last updated Apr 21, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/privacy-proxy/reference/metrics/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Privacy Proxy provides two methods for accessing metrics and monitoring your proxy deployment. We recommend getting started with GraphQL as the default method for observability.

* [GraphQL Analytics API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/privacy-proxy/reference/metrics/graphql/)
* [OpenTelemetry](https://developers.cloudflare.com/privacy-proxy/reference/metrics/opentelemetry/)

## Data privacy

Regardless of whether you use the GraphQL Analytics API or OpenTelemetry, Privacy Proxy observability data does not include:

* User IP addresses
* Request content or headers (beyond what is needed for metrics)
* Destination URLs or hostnames (aggregated only)
* Authentication tokens or credentials

Both methods export only operational metrics that help you monitor service health without compromising user privacy.
