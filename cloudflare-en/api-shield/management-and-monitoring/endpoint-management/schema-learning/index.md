# Schema learning

Last updated Aug 3, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api-shield/management-and-monitoring/endpoint-management/schema-learning/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Schema learning observes live API traffic for operations in the `full` state. It discovers the parameters, headers, and body formats that your API endpoints accept. You can export learned schemas in OpenAPI `v3.0.0` format by hostname.

For API Shield customers using unified operation discovery, select **Learn profile** from a discovered operation's row actions. This promotes the operation to the `full` state and starts collecting data for schema learning. The action then changes to **Profile learned**. For more information, refer to [Promote an operation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/security/web-assets/manage-operations/#promote-an-operation).

To protect your API with a learned schema, refer to [Schema validation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api-shield/security/schema-validation/#add-validation-by-applying-a-learned-schema-to-an-entire-hostname).

## Export a schema

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Web Assets** page.  
[Go to **Web assets** ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/:zone/security/web-assets)
2. Go to the **Operations** tab.
3. Select **Export schema** and choose a hostname to export.
4. Select whether to include learned parameters and rate limit recommendations.
5. Select **Export schema** and choose a location to save the file.

Note

The schema is saved as a JSON file in OpenAPI `v3.0.0` format.

## Learned schema contents

Learned schemas always include:

* The listed hostname in the servers section
* All full operations by hostname, method, and path

For operations that receive sufficient traffic, learned schemas will also include:

* Detected path variables and formats
* Detected query parameters and formats
* Detected `POST`, `PUT`, and `PATCH` body variable names and formats for `application/json` content types

Learned schemas can optionally include:

* API Shield's rate limit threshold recommendations

## Limitations

An operation must remain in the `full` state for at least 24 hours before schema learning begins. Schema learning continuously inspects the last 72 hours of traffic to the operation.

Schema learning only learns from requests with `2xx` response codes.

Schema learning works best with high traffic volumes. Learned schemas may have lower confidence for operations with fewer than 10,000 requests in the last 72 hours.
