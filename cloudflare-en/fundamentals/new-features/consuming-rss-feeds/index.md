# Consuming RSS Feeds

Last updated Apr 20, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/new-features/consuming-rss-feeds/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Our [changelogs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/) are published to [various RSS feeds](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/new-features/available-rss-feeds/) with HTML in the `<description>` tag.

In feeds with multiple products, such as the global or product-area feeds, the products associated with a given entry are in the `<category>` tag.

A single product will also appear in the custom `<product>` tag for legacy reasons, but we recommend you use the `<category>`

## Example XML

```xml
<rss version="2.0">
	<channel>
		<title>Cloudflare changelogs</title>
