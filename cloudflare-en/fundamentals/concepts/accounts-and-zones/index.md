# Accounts, zones, and profiles

Last updated Apr 20, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/concepts/accounts-and-zones/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Within the Cloudflare ecosystem, there are three organizing concepts that control where specific settings live: user profiles, accounts, and zones.

## User profiles

Each user has a profile that contains several settings, such as [Communication preferences](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/user-profiles/customize-account/#notifications) and [Language preferences](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/user-profiles/customize-account/#language).

To access your profile, select the user icon and then **My Profile** from any page within the [Cloudflare dashboard ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com).

## Accounts

An account refers to an organization account, which contains one or more users and zones. Users can belong to multiple accounts, and each account maintains its own settings, including [billing profiles](https://developers.cloudflare.com/billing/get-started/create-billing-profile/), [account members](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/manage-members/), [lists](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/tools/lists/), and other configurations.

Several account-level products - such as [Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/), [Pages](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/), [Security Center](https://developers.cloudflare.com/security-center/), and [Bulk redirects](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/url-forwarding/bulk-redirects/) \- can affect some or all zones contained within that account.

After you [log in ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com) and select an account - but before you select a zone - the sidebar will list account-level products.

When you log into the [Cloudflare dashboard ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com), you can access all accounts where your user is a member. To access account settings and account-level products from within a zone, use the **Accounts** option from the navigation sidebar.

## Zones

Domains (or [subdomains](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/zone-setups/subdomain-setup/)) that are added to Cloudflare become zones[1](#user-content-fn-1), which have a direct impact on the security and performance of your website, application, or API. Use your zone to monitor security and performance, update configurations, and apply zone-level products and services.

Zone-level services - such as [Load Balancers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/load-balancing/) and [Cache rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cache/how-to/cache-rules/) \- only affect your website, application, or API for that zone and not other zones, even if they are contained within the same account.

When you log into the [Cloudflare dashboard ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com) and choose an account, you can view a list of all zones within that account.

Once you are within a zone, items within the sidebar will be zone-related products. If you need to change to another zone, use the forward arrow next to the zone name or by go back to the homepage of your account.
