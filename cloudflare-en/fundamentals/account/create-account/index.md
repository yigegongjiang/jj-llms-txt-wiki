# Create account

Last updated Sep 17, 2026|Copy as Markdown| [View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/account/create-account/index.md)| [Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

To create your first Cloudflare account:

1. Go to the [Sign up page ↗︎](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up).
2. Enter your **Email** and **Password**.
3. Select **Create Account**.

Once you create your account, Cloudflare will automatically send an email to your address to [verify that email address](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/user-profiles/verify-email-address/).

## Create an additional Free account

Existing users can create additional Free accounts in the dashboard or with the API.

### Eligibility

The following requirements apply to Free account creation:

- Your Cloudflare user must be active and at least seven days old.
- You must have the Super Administrator role on an existing account.
- You can create up to five additional Free accounts.

### Create an account in the dashboard

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard ↗︎](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) and go to **Accounts**. [Go to **Accounts** ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/)
2. Select **Create Account**.
3. Enter an account name.
4. Select **Create Account**.

### Create an account with the API

Use a user-owned API token or OAuth access token. Account-owned API tokens cannot create accounts.

A user-owned API token requires the **User Details Read** permission. An OAuth access token requires the `user-details.read` scope.

Set the `standalone` field to `true` and omit `unit`. Every Free account creation request requires exactly one valid `Idempotency-Key` header. Reuse the same key when retrying the same request.

Set `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` to a user-owned API token. Set `IDEMPOTENCY_KEY` to a unique value for this account creation request.

```bash
curl "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts" \
	--request POST \
	--header "Authorization: Bearer $CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN" \
	--header "Content-Type: application/json" \
	--header "Idempotency-Key: $IDEMPOTENCY_KEY" \
	--data '{"name":"Example account","type":"standard","standalone":true}'
```

Set `CLOUDFLARE_OAUTH_TOKEN` to an OAuth access token. Set `IDEMPOTENCY_KEY` to a unique value for this account creation request.

```bash
curl "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts" \
	--request POST \
	--header "Authorization: Bearer $CLOUDFLARE_OAUTH_TOKEN" \
	--header "Content-Type: application/json" \
	--header "Idempotency-Key: $IDEMPOTENCY_KEY" \
	--data '{"name":"Example account","type":"standard","standalone":true}'
```

For the complete request schema, refer to [Create Account](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/accounts/methods/create/).

### Resolve account creation errors

Use the error message to resolve common account creation failures:

| Error | Resolution |
| --- | --- |
| Your user is less than seven days old. | Wait until the user is at least seven days old. |
| You are not a Super Administrator. | Confirm that you have the Super Administrator role on an existing account. |
| You reached an account creation limit. | Use an existing account or contact your account team. |
| Account creation is temporarily unavailable. | Retry the request later with the same idempotency key. |
| The idempotency key was used for a different request. | Use a new key for the new request. Reuse the original key only for an identical retry. |
| Your user is suspended. | Contact [Cloudflare Support](https://developers.cloudflare.com/support/contacting-cloudflare-support/). |

## Account name

Your account name defaults to `<<YOUR_EMAIL_ADDRESS>>'s Account`.

You may want to customize the name of this account, either to help specify its purpose or to help associate it with multiple accounts.

To change your account name:

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Configurations** page. [Go to **Configurations** ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/configurations)
2. For **Account Name**, select **Change Name**.
3. Enter a new account name.
4. Select **Save**.

## Best practices

If you are creating an account for your team or a business, we recommend choosing an email alias or distribution list for your **Email**, such as `cloudflare@example.com`.

This email address is the main point of contact for your Cloudflare billing, usage notifications, and account recovery.

Refer to [Account and domain management best practices](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/reference/best-practices/) for a detailed list of ways to protect your account and domain.

Once you [set up an account](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/account/), you have several ways to interact with Cloudflare.

## Interact with Cloudflare

If you prefer working without code, you can manage your account and domain settings through the [Cloudflare dashboard ↗︎](https://dash.cloudflare.com/login).

Note

If your domain was added to Cloudflare by a hosting partner, manage your DNS records via the hosting partner.

For those who prefer to interact with Cloudflare programmatically, you can use several methods:

| Resource | Docs | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Cloudflare API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/) | [API docs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/) | RESTful API based on HTTPS requests and JSON responses. |
| [Terraform ↗︎](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/cloudflare/cloudflare/latest/docs) | [Terraform docs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/terraform/) | Configure Cloudflare using HashiCorp's Infrastructure as Code tool, Terraform. |
| [cloudflare-go ↗︎](https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflare-go) | [README ↗︎](https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflare-go#readme) | The official Go library for the Cloudflare API. |
| [cloudflare-typescript ↗︎](https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflare-typescript) | [README ↗︎](https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflare-typescript#readme) | The official TypeScript library for the Cloudflare API. |
| [cloudflare-python ↗︎](https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflare-python) | [README ↗︎](https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflare-python#readme) | The official Python library for the Cloudflare API. |
