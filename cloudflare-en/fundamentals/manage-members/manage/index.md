# Manage

Last updated Apr 20, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/manage-members/manage/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Granting access to others on your account is done with several sets of data principles:

1. Accounts have Account Members.
2. Account Members have policies.
3. Policies are constructed out of actors, roles, and scopes.

When assigning a new user, you can assign a policy to them directly. If multiple policies are needed, they can be added or revoked at a later time.

Learn how to add new account members, edit or revoke their access, and resend verification emails.

Note

To manage account members, you must have a role of **Super Administrator** and have a [verified email address](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/user-profiles/verify-email-address/).

## View account members

To manage account members, you must have a role of **Super Administrator** and have a [verified email address](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/user-profiles/verify-email-address/).

To view members using the dashboard:

In the \[Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Members** page.

[Go to **Members** ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/members)

To view members using the API, send a [GET request](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/accounts/subresources/members/methods/list/).

## Add account members

To manage account members, you must have a role of **Super Administrator** and have a [verified email address](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/user-profiles/verify-email-address/).

To add a member to your account:

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Members** page.  
[Go to **Members** ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/members)
2. Select **Invite**.
3. Fill out the following information:

  * **Invite members**: Enter one or more email addresses (if multiple, separate addresses with commas).
  * **Scope**: Use a variety of fields to adjust the [scope](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/manage-members/roles/) of your roles.
  * **Roles**: Choose one or more [roles](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/manage-members/roles/) to assign your members.
4. Select **Continue to summary**.

To add a member using the API, send a [POST request](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/accounts/subresources/members/methods/create/).

## Edit member permissions

To manage account members, you must have a role of **Super Administrator** and have a [verified email address](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/user-profiles/verify-email-address/).

To edit member permissions using the API, get a [list of roles](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/accounts/subresources/roles/methods/list/) available for an account.

Then, send a [PUT request](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/accounts/subresources/members/methods/update/) to edit their permissions.

```bash

curl --request PUT \
  --url https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/{account_id}/members/{member_id} \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <API_TOKEN>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
	  "roles": [
	        {
	            "id": "<ROLE_ID1>"
	        },
	        {
	            "id": "<ROLE_ID2>"
	        }
	  	]
		}'
```

## Resend an invitation

If you invited a member to your account but they cannot find the invitation or the invitation expires, you can resend the invitation through the Cloudflare dashboard:

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/login) and select your account[1](#user-content-fn-1).
2. Go to **Manage Account** \> **Members**.
3. Select a member record where their **Status** is **Invite Pending**.
4. Select **Resend invite**.

Note

If you have been invited to an account and want to remove yourself from the account, go to **Manage Account** \> **Members**. Under your email address, select **Leave**.

## Super Administrator access

If you are a Super Administrator for an account that has existing domains and you decide to leave the account, you can invite a new Super Administrator who will have access to the same account privileges.

You can delete your user as a Super Administrator, but you cannot delete your account. Other Super Administrators will continue to have access to the appropriate privileges to manage the account, including billing information.
