# Role scopes

Last updated May 21, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/manage-members/scope/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Scopes are one of three constituent parts of a policy that allows granting of access to users.

To allow for flexible combinations of access to users, Cloudflare currently has account-level scopes, domain scopes, and resource-specific scopes. Each scope is associated with a different set of [roles](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/manage-members/roles/).

* **Account scope:** Use when the member needs access across the entire account, for example, billing or account-level settings.
* **Specific domains:** Use when the member should only manage certain domains, for example, a developer who works on staging domains but should not modify production.
* **Domain groups:** Use when you have related domains that share the same access needs, for example, all production domains.
* **Specific resources:** Use when access should be limited to individual resources.

## Choose the scope of roles

Each policy has a limitation of a single scope, but you can assign multiple policies to a given user.

You can choose the scope of a policy when you [add a member](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/manage-members/manage/).

### Account scope

If you want the member to have a policy that applies across your account, use the following combination of fields.

| Field    | Value         |
| -------- | ------------- |
| Operator | _Include_     |
| Type     | _All domains_ |

Note

You can only assign [account-scoped roles](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/manage-members/roles/#account-scoped-roles) as part of these types of policies

### Specific domains

If you want the member to have a policy that applies to a specific domain, use the following combination of fields. When applying these roles to this policy, only domain-scoped roles can be used.

| Field    | Value               |
| -------- | ------------------- |
| Operator | _Include_           |
| Type     | _A specific domain_ |
| Name     | _A specific domain_ |

### Domain groups

If you have a set of domains that are all categorized similarly (e.g. all of your sensitive/production domains, all domains around a given project or geography), you can pre-assign them into a domain group and then create policies that provide access to all domains within this group.

#### Create group

To create a domain group:

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Settings** \> **Lists** page. (You must be logged in as a **Super Administrator** and have a [verified email address](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/user-profiles/verify-email-address/)).  
[Go to **Configurations** ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/configurations)
2. For **Domain Group Manager**, select **Create**.
3. Create your domain group:

  1. Select the domains to include.
  2. Add a **Name**.
  3. Select **Create**.

You can also edit and delete these groups as needed.

#### Use group

To assign a member permissions to a domain group, use the following combination of fields:

| Field    | Value           |
| -------- | --------------- |
| Operator | _Include_       |
| Type     | _Domain Group_  |
| Name     | _Example Group_ |

Note

With Domain Groups, you can only assign [domain-scoped roles](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/manage-members/roles/#domain-scoped-roles) to these members.

### Specific resources

If you want the member to have a policy that applies to a specific resource, use the following combination of fields.

| Field    | Value               |
| -------- | ------------------- |
| Operator | _Include_           |
| Type     | _Granular_          |
| Product  | _Product Name_      |
| Resource | _Specific Resource_ |

#### Available scopes

You can assign the following resource-specific scopes to members:

| Scope                                       | Description                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Individual Access applications              | Grant access to manage a specific [Access application](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/access-controls/applications/).                                            |
| Individual Access identity providers (IdPs) | Grant access to manage a specific [Cloudflare One identity provider (IdP)](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/integrations/identity-providers/).                     |
| Individual Access policies                  | Grant access to manage a specific [Access policy](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/access-controls/policies/).                                                     |
| Individual Access service tokens            | Grant access to manage a specific [Access service token](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/access-controls/service-credentials/service-tokens/).                    |
| Individual Access infrastructure targets    | Grant access to manage a specific [Access for Infrastructure target](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/access-controls/applications/non-http/infrastructure-apps/). |
| Individual Cloudflare Tunnel instances      | Grant access to manage a specific [Cloudflare Tunnel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/tunnel/) instance.                                                                         |
| Individual Cloudflare Mesh nodes            | Grant access to manage a specific [Cloudflare Mesh](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-mesh/) node.                                   |

Note

When using scopes for specific resources, you can only assign [resource-scoped roles](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/manage-members/roles/#resource-scoped-roles) to these members.
