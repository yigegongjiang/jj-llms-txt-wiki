# Get Origin CA keys

Last updated Apr 20, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/get-started/ca-keys/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Deprecated

Origin CA keys (Service Keys) are deprecated and will be removed on September 30, 2026\. Use an [API Token](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/get-started/create-token/) with `Zone`\-`SSL and Certificates`\-`Edit` permissions instead. For more information, refer to [API deprecations](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/reference/deprecations/).

Origin CA keys are often used as the value of header `X-AUTH-USER-SERVICE-KEY` when interacting with [Origin CA certificates](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/origin-configuration/origin-ca/) API. It is also used by [Keyless SSL](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/keyless-ssl/) key server.

The key value always starts with `v1.0-`.

## Limitations

* Changing the Origin CA key is not recorded by [Audit Logs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/account/account-security/review-audit-logs/).
* Each time you view the Origin CA key, it will be presented as a different value. All these different values are **simultaneously valid** until you click the `Change` button, which immediately invalidates all previously generated values.
* Origin CA keys have access to every account the user has access to.

## View/Change your Origin CA keys

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com).

2. Go to **User Profile** \> **API Tokens**.
3. In the **API Keys** section, select `Origin CA Key`.
