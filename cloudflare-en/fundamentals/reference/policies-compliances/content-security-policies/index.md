# Content Security Policies (CSPs)

Last updated Apr 20, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/reference/policies-compliances/content-security-policies/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

A **Content Security Policy (CSP)** is an added layer of security that helps detect and mitigate certain types of attacks, including:

* Content/code injection
* Cross-site scripting (XSS)
* Embedding malicious resources
* Malicious iframes (clickjacking)

To learn more about configuring a CSP in general, refer to the [Mozilla documentation ↗](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/web/http/csp).

## Using a CSP with Cloudflare

Cloudflare's [CDN](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cache/) is compatible with CSP.

Cloudflare does not:

* Modify CSP headers from the origin web server (except when using Zaraz, to ensure the [Zaraz script is always running ↗](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-zaraz-supports-csp/)).
* Require changes to acceptable sources for first or third-party content.
* Modify URLs (besides adding the [/cdn-cgi/ endpoint](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/reference/cdn-cgi-endpoint/) and [Cloudflare Fonts](https://developers.cloudflare.com/speed/optimization/content/fonts/) that rewrites Google Fonts urls).
* Interfere with locations specified in your CSP.

If you require the CSP headers to be changed or added, you can change them using some Cloudflare products:

* If your website is [proxied](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/proxy-status/) through Cloudflare, you can use a [response header transform rule](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/transform/response-header-modification/) to replace or add CSP headers.
* If your website is hosted using [Cloudflare Pages](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/), you can set a [\_headers file](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/configuration/headers/) to modify or add CSP headers.

### Product requirements

To use certain Cloudflare features, however, you may need to update the headers in your CSP:
