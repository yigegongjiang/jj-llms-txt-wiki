Last updated Jun 17, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/reference/cloudflare-site-crawling/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Cloudflare may crawl or make HTTP requests to your site to make sure its protected and performing properly.

## Crawling situations

### Specific products

Cloudflare will crawl your site when you have specific products enabled:

* [**Always Online**](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cache/how-to/always-online/)  
  * _User-Agent_: `Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; CloudFlare-AlwaysOnline/1.0; +http://www.cloudflare.com/always-online)`
* [**Health checks**](https://developers.cloudflare.com/health-checks/)  
  * _User-Agent_: `Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; Cloudflare-Healthchecks/1.0; +https://www.cloudflare.com/; healthcheck-id: <HEALTHCHECK_ID>)`
  * `HEALTHCHECK_ID` is a 16-character string associated with the health check ID.
* [**Load balancing monitors**](https://developers.cloudflare.com/load-balancing/monitors/)  
  * _User-Agent_: `Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; Cloudflare-Traffic-Manager/1.0; +https://www.cloudflare.com/traffic-manager/; pool-id: <POOL_ID>)`
  * `POOL_ID` is a 16-character string associated with the load balancing pool ID being monitored.
* [**Prefetch URLs**](https://developers.cloudflare.com/speed/optimization/content/prefetch-urls/)  
  * _User-Agent_: `Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; CloudFlare-Prefetch/0.1; +http://www.cloudflare.com/)`
* [**SSL/TLS recommender**](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/origin-configuration/ssl-tls-recommender/)  
  * _User-Agent_: `Cloudflare-SSLDetector`
  * This crawler ignores your `robots.txt` file unless there are rules explicitly targeting the user agent.
* [**Security Insights**](https://developers.cloudflare.com/security/security-insights/review-insights/)  
  * _User-Agent_: `Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/92.0.4515.107 Safari/537.36 (compatible; +https://developers.cloudflare.com/security-center/)`

### Other situations

Cloudflare will also crawl your site in other, specific situations:

* **Speed tests**  
  * _User-Agent_: `Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/75.0.3770.100 Safari/537.36 PTST/190628.140653`
  * _Triggered when_: You launch a speed test from within [the Cloudflare dashboard](https://developers.cloudflare.com/speed/observatory/run-speed-test/).
* **Support diagnostics**:  
  * _User-Agent_: `Cloudflare-diagnostics`
  * _Triggered when_: Cloudflare Support Engineers perform error checks and by continuous monitoring used to raise intelligent alerts in the Cloudflare dashboard.
* **Custom Hostname validation**:  
  * _User-Agent_: `Cloudflare Custom Hostname Verification`
  * _Triggered when_: You choose to validate a custom hostname with an [HTTP ownership token](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/domain-support/hostname-validation/pre-validation/#http-tokens).

## Developer product crawlers

[**Browser Run**](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-run/) is a Cloudflare developer product that can crawl third-party websites on behalf of Cloudflare customers. Unlike the crawlers in the Crawling situations section, it does not crawl your site as part of a Cloudflare service you have enabled. It is used by developers building applications with Cloudflare's platform.

The [**Browser Run /crawl endpoint**](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-run/quick-actions/crawl-endpoint/) uses a _User-Agent_ of `CloudflareBrowserRenderingCrawler/1.0`. For non-configurable headers, bot detection IDs, and cryptographic verification methods you can use to identify or block Browser Run traffic, refer to [Automatic request headers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-run/reference/automatic-request-headers/).

[**AI Search**](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-search/) is a Cloudflare developer product that indexes your website content so it can be searched. The AI Search crawler only crawls a website you own (the domain must exist in the same Cloudflare account) that you select as your data source in AI Search.

The crawler uses a _User-Agent_ of `Cloudflare-AI-Search`. You can allow or block it with WAF rules using its [bot detection ID](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-search/configuration/data-source/website/#allow-the-ai-search-crawler-through-waf).
