Last updated Apr 21, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/stream/examples/android/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Note

Before you can play videos, you must first [upload a video to Cloudflare Stream](https://developers.cloudflare.com/stream/uploading-videos/) or be [actively streaming to a live input](https://developers.cloudflare.com/stream/stream-live)

```kotlin
implementation 'com.google.android.exoplayer:exoplayer-hls:2.X.X'

SimpleExoPlayer player = new SimpleExoPlayer.Builder(context).build();

// Set the media item to the Cloudflare Stream HLS Manifest URL:
player.setMediaItem(MediaItem.fromUri("https://customer-9cbb9x7nxdw5hb57.cloudflarestream.com/8f92fe7d2c1c0983767649e065e691fc/manifest/video.m3u8"));

player.prepare();
```

### Download and run an example app

1. Download [this example app ↗](https://github.com/googlecodelabs/exoplayer-intro.git) from the official Android developer docs, following [this guide ↗](https://developer.android.com/codelabs/exoplayer-intro#4).
2. Open and run the [exoplayer-codelab-04 example app ↗](https://github.com/googlecodelabs/exoplayer-intro/tree/main/exoplayer-codelab-04) using [Android Studio ↗](https://developer.android.com/studio).
3. Replace the `media_url_dash` URL on [this line ↗](https://github.com/googlecodelabs/exoplayer-intro/blob/main/exoplayer-codelab-04/src/main/res/values/strings.xml#L21) with the DASH manifest URL for your video.
