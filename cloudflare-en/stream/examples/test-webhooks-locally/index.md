# Test webhooks locally

Test Cloudflare Stream webhook notifications locally using a Cloudflare Worker and Cloudflare Tunnel.

Last updated Apr 21, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/stream/examples/test-webhooks-locally/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Cloudflare Stream cannot send [webhook notifications](https://developers.cloudflare.com/stream/manage-video-library/using-webhooks/) to `localhost` or local IP addresses. To test webhooks during local development, you need a publicly accessible URL that forwards requests to your local machine.

Note

This example covers webhooks for on-demand (VOD) videos only. Live stream webhooks are configured differently. For more information, refer to [Receive live webhooks](https://developers.cloudflare.com/stream/stream-live/webhooks/).

This example shows how to:

1. Start a [Cloudflare Tunnel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-tunnel/do-more-with-tunnels/trycloudflare/) to get a public URL for your local environment.
2. Register that URL as your webhook endpoint, which returns the signing secret.
3. Create a Cloudflare Worker that receives Stream webhook events and verifies their signatures.

## Prerequisites

* A [Cloudflare account ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up) with Stream enabled
* [Node.js ↗](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later)
* The [Wrangler CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/) installed (`npm install -g wrangler`)

## 1\. Create a Worker project

Create a new Worker project that will receive webhook requests:

```sh
npm create cloudflare@latest stream-webhook-handler
```

## 2\. Start a Cloudflare Tunnel

Before registering a webhook URL, you need a public URL that points to your local machine. In a terminal, start a [quick tunnel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-tunnel/do-more-with-tunnels/trycloudflare/) that forwards to the default Wrangler dev server port (`8787`):

```sh
npx cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:8787
```

`cloudflared` will output a public URL similar to:

```txt
https://example-words-here.trycloudflare.com
```

Copy this URL. It changes every time you restart the tunnel.

## 3\. Register the tunnel URL as your webhook endpoint

Use the Stream API to set the tunnel URL as your webhook notification URL. The API response includes a `secret` field — you will need this to verify webhook signatures.

Required API token permissions

At least one of the following [token permissions](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/reference/permissions/) is required:
* `Stream Write`

```bash
curl "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/$ACCOUNT_ID/stream/webhook" \
	--request PUT \
	--header "Authorization: Bearer $CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN" \
	--json '{
		"notificationUrl": "https://example-words-here.trycloudflare.com"
	}'
```

The response will include a `secret` field:

```json
{
	"result": {
		"notificationUrl": "https://example-words-here.trycloudflare.com",
		"modified": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000000Z",
		"secret": "85011ed3a913c6ad5f9cf6c5573cc0a7"
	},
	"success": true,
	"errors": [],
	"messages": []
}
```

Save the `secret` value. You will use it in the next step.

## 4\. Store the webhook secret for local development

Create a `.dev.vars` file in the root of your Worker project and add the webhook secret from the API response:

```txt
WEBHOOK_SECRET=85011ed3a913c6ad5f9cf6c5573cc0a7
```

Replace the value with the actual secret from step 3\. Wrangler automatically loads `.dev.vars` when running `wrangler dev`.

Caution

Do not commit `.dev.vars` to version control. Add it to your `.gitignore` file. For more information, refer to [Local development with secrets](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/secrets/#local-development-with-secrets).

## 5\. Add the webhook handler

Replace the contents of `src/index.ts` in your Worker project with the following code. This Worker receives webhook `POST` requests, [verifies the signature](https://developers.cloudflare.com/stream/manage-video-library/using-webhooks/#verify-webhook-authenticity), and logs the payload.

```ts
export interface Env {
	WEBHOOK_SECRET: string;
}

async function verifyWebhookSignature(
	request: Request,
	secret: string,
): Promise<{ valid: boolean; body: string }> {
	const signatureHeader = request.headers.get("Webhook-Signature");
	if (!signatureHeader) {
		return { valid: false, body: "" };
	}

	const body = await request.text();

	// Parse "time=<unix_ts>,sig1=<hex_signature>"
	const parts = Object.fromEntries(
		signatureHeader.split(",").map((part) => {
			const [key, value] = part.split("=");
			return [key, value];
		}),
	);

	const time = parts["time"];
	const receivedSig = parts["sig1"];

	if (!time || !receivedSig) {
		return { valid: false, body };
	}

	// Build the source string: "<time>.<body>"
	const sourceString = `${time}.${body}`;
	const encoder = new TextEncoder();

	const key = await crypto.subtle.importKey(
		"raw",
		encoder.encode(secret),
		{ name: "HMAC", hash: "SHA-256" },
		false,
		["sign"],
	);

	const signature = await crypto.subtle.sign(
		"HMAC",
		key,
		encoder.encode(sourceString),
	);

	const expectedSig = [...new Uint8Array(signature)]
		.map((b) => b.toString(16).padStart(2, "0"))
		.join("");

	// Use a timing-safe comparison.
	// Do not return early when lengths differ — that leaks the expected
	// signature's length through timing.  Compare against self and negate instead.
	const expectedBytes = encoder.encode(expectedSig);
	const receivedBytes = encoder.encode(receivedSig);

	const lengthsMatch = expectedBytes.byteLength === receivedBytes.byteLength;
	const signaturesMatch = lengthsMatch
		? crypto.subtle.timingSafeEqual(expectedBytes, receivedBytes)
		: !crypto.subtle.timingSafeEqual(expectedBytes, expectedBytes);

	return { valid: signaturesMatch, body };
}

export default {
	async fetch(request: Request, env: Env): Promise<Response> {
		if (request.method !== "POST") {
			return new Response("Method not allowed", { status: 405 });
		}

		if (!env.WEBHOOK_SECRET) {
			console.error("WEBHOOK_SECRET is not set");
			return new Response("Server misconfigured", { status: 500 });
		}

		const { valid, body } = await verifyWebhookSignature(
			request,
			env.WEBHOOK_SECRET,
		);

		if (!valid) {
			console.error("Invalid webhook signature");
			return new Response("Invalid signature", { status: 403 });
		}

		console.log("Webhook signature verified successfully");

		const payload = JSON.parse(body);

		console.log("Stream webhook received:", JSON.stringify(payload, null, 2));
		console.log("Video UID:", payload.uid);
		console.log("Status:", payload.status?.state);
		console.log("Ready to stream:", payload.readyToStream);

		// Add your own processing logic here — for example, update a database
		// or notify a downstream service.

		return new Response("OK", { status: 200 });
	},
} satisfies ExportedHandler<Env>;
```

## 6\. Start the local dev server

In a separate terminal (keep the tunnel running), start the Worker locally with Wrangler:

```sh
npx wrangler dev
```

Wrangler will load the `WEBHOOK_SECRET` from your `.dev.vars` file automatically.

## 7\. Trigger a test event

Upload a video to Stream to trigger a webhook event. Once the video finishes processing, you will see the webhook payload logged in the terminal running `wrangler dev`, along with a confirmation that the signature was verified.

## Moving to production

When you are done testing locally, deploy the Worker and update the webhook URL to your production endpoint:

```sh
npx wrangler deploy
```

Then update the webhook subscription to point to your deployed Worker URL:

Required API token permissions

At least one of the following [token permissions](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/reference/permissions/) is required:
* `Stream Write`

```bash
curl "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/$ACCOUNT_ID/stream/webhook" \
	--request PUT \
	--header "Authorization: Bearer $CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN" \
	--json '{
		"notificationUrl": "https://your-worker.your-subdomain.workers.dev"
	}'
```

Caution

Updating the webhook URL rotates the signing secret. After you update the URL to your production endpoint, copy the new `secret` from the API response and set it as a secret on your deployed Worker:

```sh
npx wrangler secret put WEBHOOK_SECRET
```

If you restart the tunnel later for additional local testing, you will need to repeat steps 3 and 4 to register the new tunnel URL and update the secret in `.dev.vars`.
