Example of video playback with Cloudflare Stream and Shaka Player

Last updated Apr 21, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/stream/examples/shaka-player/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

First, create a video element, using the poster attribute to set a preview thumbnail image. Refer to [Display thumbnails](https://developers.cloudflare.com/stream/viewing-videos/displaying-thumbnails/) for instructions on how to generate a thumbnail image using Cloudflare Stream.

```html
<video
	id="video"
	width="640"
	poster="https://customer-f33zs165nr7gyfy4.cloudflarestream.com/6b9e68b07dfee8cc2d116e4c51d6a957/thumbnails/thumbnail.jpg"
	controls
	autoplay
></video>
```

Then listen for `DOMContentLoaded` event, create a new instance of Shaka Player, and load the manifest URI.

```javascript
// Replace the manifest URI with an HLS or DASH manifest from Cloudflare Stream
const manifestUri =
	'https://customer-f33zs165nr7gyfy4.cloudflarestream.com/6b9e68b07dfee8cc2d116e4c51d6a957/manifest/video.mpd';

document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
	const video = document.getElementById('video');
  const player = new shaka.Player(video);
	await player.load(manifestUri);
});
```

Refer to the [Shaka Player documentation ↗](https://github.com/shaka-project/shaka-player) for more information.
