Last updated Apr 21, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/stream/uploading-videos/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Before you upload your video, review the options for uploading a video, supported formats, and recommendations.

## Supported video formats

Note

Files must be less than 30 GB, and content should be encoded and uploaded in the same frame rate it was recorded.

* MP4
* MKV
* MOV
* AVI
* FLV
* MPEG-2 TS
* MPEG-2 PS
* MXF
* LXF
* GXF
* 3GP
* WebM
* MPG
* Quicktime

## Recommendations for on-demand videos

* Optional but ideal settings:  
  * MP4 containers
  * AAC audio codec
  * H264 video codec
  * 60 or fewer frames per second
* Closed GOP (_Only required for live streaming._)
* Mono or Stereo audio. Stream will mix audio tracks with more than two channels down to stereo.

## Frame rates

Stream accepts video uploads at any frame rate. During encoding, Stream re-encodes videos for a maximum of 70 FPS playback. If the original video has a frame rate lower than 70 FPS, Stream re-encodes at the original frame rate.

For variable frame rate content, Stream drops extra frames. For example, if there is more than one frame within a 1/30 second window, Stream drops the extra frames within that period.
