# Get live viewer counts

Last updated Apr 21, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/stream/getting-analytics/live-viewer-count/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

The Stream player has full support for live viewer counts by default. To get the viewer count for live videos for use with third party players, make a `GET` request to the `/views` endpoint.

```bash
https://customer-<CODE>.cloudflarestream.com/<INPUT_ID>/views
```

Below is a response for a live video with several active viewers:

```json
{ "liveViewers": 113 }
```
