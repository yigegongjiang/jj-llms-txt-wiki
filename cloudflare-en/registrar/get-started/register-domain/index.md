# Register a new domain

Last updated Apr 24, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/registrar/get-started/register-domain/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

## Prerequisites and restrictions

Cloudflare nameservers

All domains acquired via Cloudflare Registrar use Cloudflare nameservers, automatically [protecting and speeding up](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/concepts/how-cloudflare-works/) your content or services. You will not be able to change to another DNS provider's nameservers while using Cloudflare Registrar.

* Cloudflare Registrar does not currently support internationalized domain names (IDNs), also known as Unicode.
* You must have a [verified account email address](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/user-profiles/verify-email-address/), to transfer or register domains.

Note

If you purchased your domain through Cloudflare Registrar, [ICANN ↗](https://www.icann.org/) requires you to verify your registrant email address. If your email is unverified or if the verification has expired, ICANN places a hold on the domain and replaces your nameservers with parking server nameservers (NS). Once you complete verification, your nameservers are automatically restored.

## How to register a new domain

Note

If you are registering a `.us` domain, refer to the [Additional requirements for .US domains](https://developers.cloudflare.com/registrar/top-level-domains/us-domains/) before proceeding.

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Register domains** page.  
[Go to **Register domains** ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/registrar/register)
2. In the search box, enter the domain name you wish to register, and select **Search**. You may also enter one or more keywords. The search results will contain a list of suggested domains. If the domain you entered does not appear in the list, this means it is not available for registration.

Important

Cloudflare Registrar currently does not support internationalized domain names (IDNs), also known as unicode. For that reason, you cannot search for words with special characters, such as `à`, `ü`, `ç`, among others.

1. Select **Purchase** on the domain you wish to register. In rare instances, a domain that is not available for registration may appear in the search results. After selecting **Purchase**, a definitive availability check will be performed to confirm that the domain is actually available for registration.
2. Select the term (number of years) you wish to register the domain from the **Payment option** drop-down menu. Most top-level domains (TLDs) can be registered for a maximum of ten years. Some TLDs may have different term limits and these will be reflected in the drop-down options.  
The expiration date and price will update automatically based on the term selected. The **Renew On** date is the date that the system will attempt to auto-renew the domain. All registrations have Auto-renew turned on by default. However, you may [disable this option](https://developers.cloudflare.com/registrar/account-options/renew-domains/) at any time.
3. Enter the contact details for the domain. These details will be used to create all of the required contacts (Registrant, Admin, Technical, and Billing), and may be updated after registration is completed. Refer to [Contact requirements](#contact-requirements) to learn the specific requirements for each contact field.

Note

If you have previously registered or transferred a domain name, the form will be filled in advance with the information from your default contact. If not, you will need to fill out the form.

It is important that you provide complete and accurate contact information. If you do not follow this recommendation, the domain registration may be suspended and/or canceled.

1. In **Payment**, select which type of payment you want to use. If you already have a billing profile, Cloudflare uses this information to automatically fill the form. If there is no billing profile, you need to enter your payment information.
2. Review the terms and conditions, including the Domain Registration Agreement, Self-serve Subscription Agreement, and the Privacy Policy.
3. Select **Complete purchase** to continue. By selecting **Complete purchase**, you acknowledge that you are accepting the terms of the agreements.

The registration process may take up to 30 seconds to complete. Once the registration is complete, the browser will navigate to the domain management page where you may update the contacts, change the auto-renew settings, and add additional years to the term. You will also receive a confirmation email regarding your new domain registration.

## Contact requirements

At this time, you can only use ASCII characters for contact data. If the default contact has non-ASCII characters, you will need to update the domain contact details before proceeding. Cloudflare recommends that you update your default contact information to include ASCII characters only.

When you register a domain with Cloudflare, your personal information is redacted when permitted by the registry. Refer to [WHOIS redaction](https://developers.cloudflare.com/registrar/account-options/whois-redaction/) for more information.

## Next steps

To improve the security of your domain, enable [Domain Name System Security Extensions](https://developers.cloudflare.com/registrar/get-started/enable-dnssec/) to create a secure layer with a cryptographic signature.
