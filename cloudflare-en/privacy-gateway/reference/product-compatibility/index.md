# Product compatibility

Last updated Apr 21, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/privacy-gateway/reference/product-compatibility/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

When [using Privacy Gateway](https://developers.cloudflare.com/privacy-gateway/get-started/), the majority of Cloudflare products will be compatible with your application.

However, the following products are not compatible:

* [API Shield](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api-shield/): [Schema Validation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api-shield/security/schema-validation/) and [API discovery](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api-shield/security/api-discovery/) are not possible since Cloudflare cannot see the request URLs.
* [Cache](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cache/): Caching of application content is no longer possible since each between client and gateway is end-to-end encrypted.
* [WAF](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/): Rules implemented based on request content are not supported since Cloudflare cannot see the request or response content.
