**Data localization support for Artifacts**  

Artifacts now supports jurisdictions, allowing you to select the European Union or the United States as the only location where repo data is stored and processed.

Select a jurisdiction when you create a namespace. Every repo in that namespace automatically uses the selected jurisdiction.

```bash
curl --request POST \
  "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/$ACCOUNT_ID/artifacts/namespaces" \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer $CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN" \
  --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{
    "namespace": "my-eu-namespace",
    "jurisdiction": "eu"
  }'
```

Jurisdictions cannot be changed after namespace creation. If you omit the jurisdiction, Artifacts creates an unrestricted namespace.

For supported jurisdictions and usage details, refer to [Data localization](https://developers.cloudflare.com/artifacts/guides/data-localization/).

**Manage Artifacts from the Cloudflare dashboard**  

You can now configure [Artifacts](https://developers.cloudflare.com/artifacts/concepts/how-artifacts-works/) namespaces, repos, and tokens directly from the Cloudflare dashboard.

Artifacts is Git-compatible storage that lets you store repos on Cloudflare and interact with them using standard Git workflows.

You can view and create [namespaces](https://developers.cloudflare.com/artifacts/concepts/namespaces/#use-namespaces-as-containers), which are top-level containers for repos:

![Artifacts namespaces dashboard showing namespace search and create namespace controls](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/image/onerror=redirect,width=1804,height=598,format=webp/_astro/dashboard-namespaces.0BJelWZh.png) 

You can view, create, fork, and search repos within a namespace:

You can open a repo to view its files and copy its Git remote URL.

You can also provision tokens directly from the dashboard to scope Git access to a single repo, with read tokens for clone, fetch, and pull workflows, or write tokens when a client needs to push changes.

To get started, go to the [Cloudflare dashboard ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) and select **Storage & databases** \> **Artifacts**.

If you are enrolled in the Artifacts beta, you can use the dashboard to set up Artifacts. If you would like to join the beta, complete the [request form ↗](https://forms.gle/DwBoPRa3CWQ8ajFp7).

**Manage Artifacts namespaces and repos with Wrangler CLI**  

You can now manage [Artifacts](https://developers.cloudflare.com/artifacts/) namespaces, repos, and repo-scoped tokens directly from Wrangler CLI.

Available commands:

* `wrangler artifacts namespaces list` — List Artifacts namespaces in your account.
* `wrangler artifacts namespaces get` — Get metadata for a namespace.
* `wrangler artifacts repos create` — Create a repo in a namespace.
* `wrangler artifacts repos list` — List repos in a namespace.
* `wrangler artifacts repos get` — Get metadata for a repo.
* `wrangler artifacts repos delete` — Delete a repo.
* `wrangler artifacts repos issue-token` — Issue a repo-scoped token for Git access.

To get started, refer to the [Wrangler Artifacts commands documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/commands/artifacts/).

**Artifacts now in beta: versioned filesystem with Git access**  

[Artifacts](https://developers.cloudflare.com/artifacts/) is now in private beta. Artifacts is Git-compatible storage built for scale: create tens of millions of repos, fork from any remote, and hand off a URL to any Git client. It provides a versioned filesystem for storing and exchanging file trees across Workers, the REST API, and any Git client, running locally or within an agent.

You can [read the announcement blog ↗](https://blog.cloudflare.com/artifacts-git-for-agents-beta/) to learn more about what Artifacts does, how it works, and how to create repositories for your agents to use.

Artifacts has three API surfaces:

* Workers bindings (for creating and managing repositories)
* REST API (for creating and managing repos from any other compute platform)
* Git protocol (for interacting with repos)

As an example: you can use the Workers binding to create a repo and read back its remote URL:

```ts
# Create a thousand, a million or ten million repos: one for every agent, for every upstream branch, or every user.
const created = await env.PROD_ARTIFACTS.create("agent-007");
const remote = (await created.repo.info())?.remote;
```

Or, use the REST API to create a repo inside a namespace from your agent(s) running on any platform:

```bash
curl --request POST "https://artifacts.cloudflare.net/v1/api/namespaces/some-namespace/repos" --header "Authorization: Bearer $CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN" --header "Content-Type: application/json" --data '{"name":"agent-007"}'
```

Any Git client that speaks smart HTTP can use the returned remote URL:

```bash
# Agents know git.
# Every repository can act as a git repo, allowing agents to interact with Artifacts the way they know best: using the git CLI.
git clone https://x:${REPO_TOKEN}@artifacts.cloudflare.net/some-namespace/agent-007.git
```

To learn more, refer to [Get started](https://developers.cloudflare.com/artifacts/get-started/), [Workers binding](https://developers.cloudflare.com/artifacts/api/workers-binding/), and [Git protocol](https://developers.cloudflare.com/artifacts/api/git-protocol/).
