# Artifacts

Last updated May 5, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/artifacts/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Versioned storage that speaks Git.

Note

Artifacts is currently in closed beta. To request access, fill out [this form ↗](https://forms.gle/DwBoPRa3CWQ8ajFp7).

Artifacts stores versioned file trees behind a Git-compatible interface. Create repositories programmatically, import existing repositories, and hand off a URL to any standard Git client.

Review [Namespaces](https://developers.cloudflare.com/artifacts/concepts/namespaces/) before you start, then choose the namespace name you will use for these repos.

Use Artifacts when you need to:

* Store versioned file trees instead of raw blobs
* Hand off work to Git-aware tools, agents, and automation
* Isolate work in separate repos or branches for safer parallel execution
* Fork from a shared baseline and diff or merge the results later

The same repository can be addressed from [Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/artifacts/get-started/workers/), the REST API, and Git clients. You can create one repo per agent, user, branch, or task, keep each unit of work separate, and compare or merge the results later.

### [Get started](https://developers.cloudflare.com/artifacts/get-started/)

Create your first repo with Workers or the REST API.

### [Guides](https://developers.cloudflare.com/artifacts/guides/)

### [API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/artifacts/api/)

Review the Workers binding, REST API, and Git protocol.

### [Observability](https://developers.cloudflare.com/artifacts/observability/)

Explore metrics for understanding Artifact activity.

### [Examples](https://developers.cloudflare.com/artifacts/examples/)
