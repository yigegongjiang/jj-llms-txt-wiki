# TURN Service

Last updated Apr 21, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/realtime/turn/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Separately from the SFU, Realtime offers a managed TURN service. TURN acts as a relay point for traffic between WebRTC clients like the browser and SFUs, particularly in scenarios where direct communication is obstructed by NATs or firewalls. TURN maintains an allocation of public IP addresses and ports for each session, ensuring connectivity even in restrictive network environments.

Using Cloudflare Realtime TURN service is available free of charge when used together with the Realtime SFU. Otherwise, it costs $0.05/real-time GB outbound from Cloudflare to the TURN client.

## Service address and ports

| Protocol      | Primary address     | Primary port | Alternate port |
| ------------- | ------------------- | ------------ | -------------- |
| STUN over UDP | stun.cloudflare.com | 3478/udp     | 53/udp         |
| TURN over UDP | turn.cloudflare.com | 3478/udp     | 53/udp         |
| TURN over TCP | turn.cloudflare.com | 3478/tcp     | 80/tcp         |
| TURN over TLS | turn.cloudflare.com | 5349/tcp     | 443/tcp        |

Note

Use of alternate port 53 only by itself is not recommended. Port 53 is blocked by many ISPs, and by popular browsers such as [Chrome ↗](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src.git/+/refs/heads/master/net/base/port%5Futil.cc#44) and [Firefox ↗](https://github.com/mozilla/gecko-dev/blob/master/netwerk/base/nsIOService.cpp#L132). It is useful only in certain specific scenarios.

## Regions

Cloudflare Realtime TURN service runs on [Cloudflare's global network ↗](https://www.cloudflare.com/network) \- a growing global network of thousands of machines distributed across hundreds of locations, with the notable exception of the Cloudflare's [China Network](https://developers.cloudflare.com/china-network/).

When a client tries to connect to `turn.cloudflare.com`, it _automatically_ connects to the Cloudflare location closest to them. We achieve this using [anycast routing ↗](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/glossary/anycast-network/).

To learn more about the architecture that makes this possible, read this [technical deep-dive about Realtime ↗](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-calls-anycast-webrtc).

## Protocols and Ciphers for TURN over TLS

TLS versions supported include TLS 1.1, TLS 1.2, and TLS 1.3.

| OpenSSL Name                  | TLS 1.1 | TLS 1.2 | TLS 1.3 |
| ----------------------------- | ------- | ------- | ------- |
| AEAD-AES128-GCM-SHA256        | No      | No      | ✅       |
| AEAD-AES256-GCM-SHA384        | No      | No      | ✅       |
| AEAD-CHACHA20-POLY1305-SHA256 | No      | No      | ✅       |
| ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256 | No      | ✅       | No      |
| ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256   | No      | ✅       | No      |
| ECDHE-RSA-AES128-SHA          | ✅       | ✅       | No      |
| AES128-GCM-SHA256             | No      | ✅       | No      |
| AES128-SHA                    | ✅       | ✅       | No      |
| AES256-SHA                    | ✅       | ✅       | No      |

## MTU

There is no specific MTU limit for Cloudflare Realtime TURN service.

## Limits

Cloudflare Realtime TURN service places limits on:

* Unique IP address you can communicate with per relay allocation (>5 new IP/sec)
* Packet rate outbound and inbound to the relay allocation (>5-10 kpps)
* Data rate outbound and inbound to the relay allocation (>50-100 Mbps)

Limits apply to each TURN allocation independently

Each limit is for a single TURN allocation (single TURN user) and not account wide. Same limit will apply to each user regardless of the number of unique TURN users.

These limits are suitable for high-demand applications and also have burst rates higher than those documented above. Hitting these limits will result in packet drops.
