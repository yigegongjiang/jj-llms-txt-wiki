## 2026-01-30

**Chat Pagination Overhaul**

**Affected SDKs:** Web Core SDK 1.2.4+ and Web UI Kit 1.0.9+ (Angular/React/Web Components)

To streamline RealtimeKit SDK offerings, non-operational chat channel APIs have been removed. If you have a custom chat implementation using lower-level components instead of `rtk-chat`, please review the release notes thoroughly and test your implementation after upgrading.

## 2025-11-21

**Support for legacy media engine has been removed**

**Affected SDKs:** Web Core SDK 1.2.0+ (Angular/React/Web Components)

Legacy media engine support has been removed. 

If your organization was created before March 1, 2025 and you are upgrading to `1.2.0` or above, you may experience recording issues.

Please contact support to migrate you to the new Cloudflare SFU media engine to ensure continued recording functionality.

## 2025-11-21

**Update on meeting join issues in firefox 144+**

**Affected SDKs:** Web Core SDK < 1.2.0 (Angular/React/Web Components)

In firefox 144+, users were not able to join the meetings, due to the browser's datachannel behavior change.

Error: `x.data.arrayBuffer is not a function`

Please upgrade to atleast `v1.2.0` to fix this. It is advised to periodically upgrade the SDKs.
