**RealtimeKit Android UI Kit 3.1.0**

**Enhancements**

* Aligned the version with [RealtimeKit Android Core v3.1.0](https://developers.cloudflare.com/realtime/realtimekit/release-notes/android-core/#2026-07-17). This release has no breaking changes.

**RealtimeKit Android UI Kit 2.0.0**

**Breaking changes**

* Upgraded to [RealtimeKit Core v3.0.0](https://developers.cloudflare.com/realtime/realtimekit/release-notes/android-core/#2026-06-24). Plugins must now be declared on the client side when constructing `RtkMeetingInfo`.

**Features**

* Added Breakout Rooms support. Participants can be assigned to rooms manually or distributed automatically; hosts can create, rename, and close rooms, move participants between them, and return everyone to the main room. See the Connected Meetings documentation for a full guide.
* Added an AI Transcription panel accessible from the More Options menu. Consecutive utterances from the same speaker are merged into a single visual block. The list auto-scrolls to the latest transcript and pauses when the user scrolls up. Transcripts can be filtered by participant name or text.
* Added edit and delete actions for chat messages. Long-pressing a message opens an actions sheet with Edit and Delete options. Edited messages display an "edited" indicator.
