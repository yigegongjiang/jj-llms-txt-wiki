## 2026-07-08

**RealtimeKit React Native Core 2.0.0**

**Compatibility:** Works best with RealtimeKit React Native UI Kit 2.0.0 or later.

This is a major breaking release. Review all breaking changes below before upgrading.

**Breaking changes**

* Upgraded to `@cloudflare/realtimekit` v2.0.0.  
All [breaking changes from Web Core v2.0.0](https://developers.cloudflare.com/realtime/realtimekit/release-notes/#2026-06-18-realtimekit-web-core-200) apply, including the complete redesign of the plugin API and removal of all deprecated APIs.
* Requires React Native 0.84 or above and React 19 or above.
* Requires Expo 56 or above (for Expo users).
* Requires iOS 15.1 or above.
* Requires @cloudflare/react-native-webrtc v137.0.1 or above.
* Removed `RealtimeKitCore` import in iOS Screenshare setup and added a Podfile installer script to automatically add references to the Screenshare related files. Refer documentation for [iOS Screenshare setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/realtime/realtimekit/core/local-participant/#screen-share-setup-ios).
* `initClient` return type changed from `Promise<RealtimeKitClient>` to `Promise<RealtimeKitClient | undefined>`. Code that assumes `initClient` always returns a defined value must add a null check.

**Features**

* `Connected Meetings` support: the `useRealtimeKitClient` hook now automatically listens to `connectedMeetings.meetingChanged` and hot-swaps the active client when switching between connected or breakout meetings.
* `Background support` for Android (enabled by default):
  * New exported type `KeepAliveServiceConfig` to configure the Android meeting foreground service notification (title, body text, enable/disable).
  * New `useRealtimeKitClient({ keepAliveService })` option to customize or disable the Android foreground notification.
  * New `useRealtimeKitClient({ resetOnLeave })` option to reset client state on room leave.

**Fixes**

* Fixed an issue where the microphone did not work after being toggled if audio permission had not been granted before joining the meeting.
* Fixed an issue where the in-call notification on Android persisted after the meeting ended.
* Fixed an issue where screen sharing failed on the first attempt on Android 14 and above.
* Fixed an issue where stopping screen sharing did not properly clean up event listeners, which could cause screen sharing to malfunction in subsequent sessions.

## 2026-06-18

**RealtimeKit React Native Core 1.1.0**

**Features**

* Added a dedicated error code `0014` for media (WebRTC) connection failures during room join, making it easier to distinguish media failures from socket and signaling failures.

**Enhancements**

* Init and join failures from `initMeeting()` and `meeting.join()` now surface specific error codes and descriptive messages instead of generic errors.

**Fixes**

* Fixed an issue where `ClientError` objects were wrapped inside each other when the SDK retried failed API requests, causing nested error messages and duplicate `onError` callbacks.

## 2026-05-05

**RealtimeKit React Native Core 1.0.0**

**Breaking changes**

* Removed Hive SFU support. Only the Cloudflare SFU is supported going forward.
* The default base URI is now `realtime.cloudflare.com`. Calling `initMeeting()` with baseURI parameter set to a `dyte.io` base domain now throws an Error.
* `RealtimeKitClientOptions` is renamed to `RTKClientOptions`.

**Fixes**

* Fixed an issue where sometimes after rejoining a meeting & upon stopping iOS screenshare, the app freezes.

**Fixes**

* Fixed the issue when leaving & rejoining a meeting causes the local media to stop working
