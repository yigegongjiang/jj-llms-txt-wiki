## 2026-07-17

**RealtimeKit Android Core 3.1.0**

**Enhancements**

* Room joins are up to 25% faster under normal network conditions
* Improved the initial quality of video received from mobile participants

**Fixes**

* Fixed a crash when switching between breakout rooms
* When unmuting audio or video, the SDK now requests permission when the corresponding `RtkMeetingInfo.enableAudio` or `RtkMeetingInfo.enableVideo` field is `false`. The UI Kit component is no longer silently disabled.

## 2026-06-24

**RealtimeKit Android Core 3.0.0**

**Breaking changes**

* Plugins are no longer provided by the server. They must now be declared upfront on the client side by passing a `plugins` list to `RtkMeetingInfo`. Any plugin not declared at initialization will not be available in the meeting.  
```kotlin  
val meetingInfo = RtkMeetingInfo(  
  authToken = authToken,  
  plugins = listOf(  
    RtkClientPluginConfig(  
      id = "whiteboard", // Must match the plugin ID used on Web for sync to work  
      name = "Whiteboard",  
      icon = "https://example.com/logo.png",  
      url = "https://example.com",  
      permissions = RtkClientPluginPermissions(canActivate = true, canDeactivate = true),  
    )  
  ),  
)  
```
* Several internal properties have been removed from `RtkPlugin`: `baseURL`, `config`, `description`, `isPrivate`, and `staggered`. Use the new `icon` and `permissions` properties instead.
* The two-argument `subscribe(key, (key, value) → Unit)` and `unsubscribe(key, (key, value) → Unit)` overloads on `RtkStore` have been removed. Use the single-argument callback variants introduced in 2.1.0.

**Features**

* **AI Transcription** — A new `RtkAi` class (exposed as `client.ai`) provides access to real-time transcripts. Implement `RtkAiEventListener` and register it with `addAiEventListener()` to receive `onTranscript(data: RtkTranscriptionData)` callbacks. A `transcriptionEnabled` permission is available on `MiscellaneousPermissions`.
* **Connected Meetings (Breakout Rooms)** — A new `RtkConnectedMeetings` class (exposed as `client.connectedMeetings`) enables breakout room workflows. Register an `RtkConnectedMeetingsEventListener` to handle room transitions and state updates. See the [Breakout Rooms](https://developers.cloudflare.com/realtime/realtimekit/core/breakout-rooms/) documentation for a full guide.
* **Chat: Edit and Delete** — Messages can now be edited and deleted. New methods on `RtkChat`: `editTextMessage()`, `editImageMessage()`, `editFileMessage()`, and `deleteMessage()`. `RtkChatEventListener` gains `onMessageEdited()` and `onMessageDeleted()` callbacks. `ChatMessage` now includes an `isEdited` flag.
* **Chat: Fetch and Pagination** — New methods on `RtkChat` — `fetchPublicMessages()`, `fetchPrivateMessages()`, `fetchPinnedMessages()`, and `getMessages()` — allow fetching historical messages with cursor-based pagination via `FetchMessagesResult(messages, hasMore)`.
* **Client-Declared Plugins** — Plugins are now configured entirely on the client via `RtkClientPluginConfig` and `RtkClientPluginPermissions`. `RtkPlugin` exposes the new `icon` and `permissions` properties accordingly.
* **Targeted Broadcast Messages** — `RtkParticipants.broadcastMessage()` now accepts an optional `targetParticipantIds: List<String>` parameter to send a message to a specific subset of participants.
* **Nullable Store Values** — `RtkStore.set()` now accepts a nullable `value: Any?`, allowing keys to be cleared by setting them to `null`.
* **Logging Control** — `RealtimeKitClient` gains `enableLogging(enabled: Boolean)` and `enableLogging(enabled: Boolean, minSeverity: LogSeverity)` to control SDK log output at runtime.
* **Result<S, F> Utility Type** — A new `sealed class Result<S, F>` with `Success` and `Failure` variants is used consistently across new async APIs.

**Fixes**

* Improved reconnection handling to ensure media recovers gracefully in more scenarios
* Improved simulcast tiers to broadcast at a wider range of qualities on higher tiers
* Fixed some races in media handling causing mute/unmute operations to rarely result in a crash
* Optimized API calls in the room join flow to speed up first join durations
* Fixed file and image uploads in chat failing under some conditions

## 2026-05-08

**RealtimeKit Android Core 2.1.0**

**Breaking changes**

* `RtkParticipants.activeSpeaker` → `RtkParticipants.lastActiveSpeaker`. The old `activeSpeaker` property is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
* `RtkSelfParticipant.enableScreenShare()` → `enableScreenShare(onResult:)`. The old no-callback version is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
* `RtkSelfParticipant.disableScreenShare()` → `disableScreenShare(onResult:)`. The old no-callback version is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
* `RtkStore.subscribe(key, (key, value) → Unit)` → `subscribe(key, (value) → Unit)`. The old two-argument callback signature is deprecated but remains functional via a backward-compatible shim.
* `RtkStore.unsubscribe(key, (key, value) → Unit)` → `unsubscribe(key, (value) → Unit)`. The old two-argument callback signature is deprecated but remains functional via a backward-compatible shim.

**Features**

* Added `RtkChat.pin()` and `RtkChat.unpin()` methods to pin and unpin chat messages
* Added `RtkChat.getMessagesByUser()` to filter messages by sender and `RtkChat.getMessagesByType()` to filter messages by type
* Added `SelfPermissions.canPinMessage()` to check whether the local participant has permission to pin messages

**Fixes**

* Fixed a memory leak in video rendering caused by `SurfaceViewRenderer` instances not being released
* Fixed recording state getting stuck as "recording" when stopping a recording that was started by another participant
* Fixed "ghost" participants appearing on the grid when a user was on the setup screen but had not yet joined the socket room
