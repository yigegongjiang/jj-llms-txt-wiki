## 2026-07-08

**RealtimeKit React Native UI Kit 2.0.0**

**Compatibility:** Requires `@cloudflare/realtimekit-react-native` (React Native Core) v2.0.0 or later

This is a major breaking release. Review all breaking changes below before upgrading.

**Breaking changes**

* Upgraded to `@cloudflare/realtimekit-react-native` v2.0.0 and `@cloudflare/realtimekit` v2.0.0\. All [breaking changes from Web Core v2.0.0](https://developers.cloudflare.com/realtime/realtimekit/release-notes/#2026-06-18-realtimekit-web-core-200) and [React Native Core v2.0.0](https://developers.cloudflare.com/realtime/realtimekit/release-notes/react-native-core/) apply.
* Removed the KeepAlive Service from the UI Kit. Background Audio/Video support for Android is now managed by `@cloudflare/realtimekit-react-native` v2.0.0\. Update your integration to use `useRealtimeKitClient({ keepAliveService })` from the Core SDK.
* `RtkPluginMain` now uses `plugin.component` (an `HTMLElement`\-like object) instead of an iframe. This aligns with the plugin API redesign in Web Core 2.0.0.
* RtkMoreMenu is now scrollable rather than a fixed-height container.

**Features**

* `Breakout Rooms` support:
  * New `RtkBreakoutRoomsManager` component: full manager UI for creating, assigning participants, and starting or stopping breakout rooms.
  * New `RtkBreakoutRoomsToggle` component: control-bar button to open or close the breakout rooms manager.
* Connected meeting switching UI: `RtkMeeting` now handles `changingMeeting` events and shows a "Joining…" interstitial screen while switching between connected rooms.
* New exported types: `ConnectedMeeting`, `ConnectedMeetingParticipant`, `ConnectedMeetingState`, `PluginIframe`.
* New state fields in the `States` type:
  * `activeBreakoutRoomsManager` — tracks breakout manager open/close state and room-switch destination.
  * `activeBreakoutConfirmation` — breakout action confirmation dialog state.

**Fixes**

* Fixed an issue where the chat sent notification showed up when a message was edited rather than only when a new message was sent.
* Fixed an issue where video from web participants did not update on mobile devices while screen sharing or a plugin was active.
* Fixed an issue where the screenshare video appeared stretched or distorted in fullscreen when switching between landscape and portrait orientations.
* Fixed an issue where host controls disappeared when the host was off stage.
* Fixed an issue where the screenshare view shook when the device was held in landscape mode on iOS.
* Fixed an issue where the screen orientation did not return to normal after closing a fullscreen plugin on Android.
* Fixed an issue where the More menu could not be scrolled when the device was in landscape mode.
* Fixed an issue where opening the More menu in landscape mode incorrectly locked the screen orientation.
* Fixed inconsistent appearance across button and toggle controls.
* Fixed an issue where participant video tiles occasionally showed outdated or frozen video.
* Fixed an issue where the "Hide Result" option was not enabled by default when creating a poll.
