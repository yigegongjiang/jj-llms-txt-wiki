## 2026-07-17

**RealtimeKit iOS UI Kit 3.1.0**

**Enhancements**

* Aligned the version with [RealtimeKit iOS Core v3.1.0](https://developers.cloudflare.com/realtime/realtimekit/release-notes/ios-core/#2026-07-17). This release has no breaking changes.

**Fixes**

* Audio and video toggle buttons no longer check permissions or disable themselves. The core SDK handles permission requests.

## 2026-06-30

**RealtimeKit iOS UI Kit 2.0.0**

**Breaking changes**

* Upgraded to [RealtimeKit Core v3.0.0](https://developers.cloudflare.com/realtime/realtimekit/release-notes/ios-core/#2026-06-24). Plugins must now be declared on the client side when constructing `RtkMeetingInfo`.

**Features**

* Added Breakout Rooms support. Participants can be assigned to rooms manually or distributed automatically; hosts can create, rename, and close rooms, move participants between them, and return everyone to the main room. See the Connected Meetings documentation for a full guide.
* Added an AI Transcription screen accessible from the More menu. The screen matches web SDK rendering behavior: consecutive utterances from the same speaker are grouped, the list auto-scrolls to the latest transcript, and transcripts can be filtered by participant name or text.
* Added edit and delete actions for chat messages. Long-pressing a message opens a context menu with Edit and Delete options. Edited messages display an "edited" indicator.
