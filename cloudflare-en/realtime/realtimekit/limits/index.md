# Limits

Last updated Sep 22, 2026|Copy as Markdown| [View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/realtime/realtimekit/limits/index.md)| [Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

RealtimeKit applies limits to API requests and SDK operations. Use these values when designing your application.

## API rate limits

RealtimeKit API requests count toward the global Cloudflare API limit, which applies across all `api.cloudflare.com` API requests. Recording APIs are subject to a separate limit.

| API | Limit |
| --- | --- |
| All RealtimeKit APIs | 3,500 requests per five minutes |
| Recording APIs | 1,000 requests per 50 seconds |

## SDK rate limits

Each participant has a separate limit for SDK operations during an active session. Limits are not shared across participants or applied to your app as a whole. For example, in a two-participant meeting, each participant can send up to 180 text messages per minute.

| Operation | Limit |
| --- | --- |
| Write to a [Collaborative Store](https://developers.cloudflare.com/realtime/realtimekit/collaborative-stores/) (`set()`, `update()`, `delete()`, `bulkSet()`, `bulkDelete()`) | 5 invocations per second |
| Broadcast a message (`broadcastMessage()`) | 5 invocations per second |
| Send a text message (`sendTextMessage()`) | 180 invocations per minute |
| Send a message (`sendMessage()`) | 180 invocations per minute |
| Send an image (`sendImageMessage()`) | 20 invocations per minute |
| Send a file (`sendFileMessage()`) | 20 invocations per minute |
| Fetch connected meetings (`getConnectedMeetings()`) | 60 invocations per minute |
| Fetch meeting participants (`getAllJoinedPeers()`) | 10 invocations per minute |
| Update participant permissions (`updatePermissions()`) | 1,000 invocations per minute |

## Data retention

For the retention periods for recordings, chat, transcripts, analytics, and webhook logs, refer to [Data retention](https://developers.cloudflare.com/realtime/realtimekit/data-retention/).
