# RealtimeKit

Last updated Aug 14, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/realtime/realtimekit/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Cloudflare RealtimeKit lets you build your own audio and video experiences inside web and mobile apps. It routes media on [Cloudflare's global WebRTC infrastructure](https://developers.cloudflare.com/realtime/sfu/calls-vs-sfus/), so you can deliver low-latency experiences to a global audience without scaling media servers or choosing regions.

Your application controls who can join and what they can do. RealtimeKit provides the SDKs and infrastructure that connect participants inside your web or mobile app.

## What you can build

### [Group video calls](https://developers.cloudflare.com/realtime/realtimekit/quickstart/)

Add multiparty calls to collaboration tools, customer portals, and online communities.

### [Virtual classrooms](https://developers.cloudflare.com/realtime/realtimekit/ui-kit/breakout-rooms/)

Split a class into smaller discussion rooms and assign participants automatically or manually.

### [Webinars and live events](https://developers.cloudflare.com/realtime/realtimekit/core/stage-management/)

Keep attendees view-only until a host grants them access to the stage.

### [Audio rooms and support calls](https://developers.cloudflare.com/realtime/realtimekit/audio-calls/)

Build voice-only sessions for support lines and community discussions.

## How RealtimeKit fits into your app

Your applicationRealtimeKit

Your applicationRealtimeKit managed layer

Your backend**Application backend**Users, scheduling, and business logic

REST API and webhooks

Control plane**Meeting services**Meetings, participants, presets, and recordings

Your frontend**Web or mobile interface**Product workflow, layout, branding, and plugins

UI Kit or Core SDK

Client session layer**Live session services**Authentication, signaling, participant state, and media controls

Participant device**Camera, microphone, and screen**Media captured inside your application

WebRTC media

Media infrastructure**Realtime SFU**Audio and video routing between participants

Your Cloudflare resources**Workers and R2**Backend workflows, recording apps, and storage

Events and outputs

Managed extensions**Recording, transcription, and webhooks**Recordings, transcripts, summaries, and lifecycle events

Identity handoff**A participant auth token connects your user to a meeting and preset.**

Your application controls the product experience. RealtimeKit manages meeting coordination and WebRTC media infrastructure.

## Key features

[Participant roles and permissions](https://developers.cloudflare.com/realtime/realtimekit/concepts/preset/)

Give hosts, speakers, and attendees different permissions for media, moderation, and in-meeting features. Reuse the same presets across meetings.

Configure presets

[Recording and custom layouts](https://developers.cloudflare.com/realtime/realtimekit/recording-guide/)

Capture composite video or separate participant audio tracks. Store recordings in [your own Cloudflare R2 bucket](https://developers.cloudflare.com/realtime/realtimekit/recording-guide/custom-cloud-storage/#cloudflare-r2), or deploy a [custom recording app](https://developers.cloudflare.com/realtime/realtimekit/recording-guide/create-record-app-using-sdks/) on [Cloudflare Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/) when you need a different layout.

Explore recording

[Transcription and summaries](https://developers.cloudflare.com/realtime/realtimekit/ai/)

RealtimeKit uses [Cloudflare Workers AI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/) for real-time and post-meeting transcription. Generate an AI summary when a meeting ends.

Add meeting AI

[In-meeting apps](https://developers.cloudflare.com/realtime/realtimekit/custom-plugins/)

Add your own browser-based, interactive apps such as whiteboard, document viewer into the meeting layout. Use [collaborative stores](https://developers.cloudflare.com/realtime/realtimekit/collaborative-stores/) to synchronize plugin state across participants.

Build a plugin

[Backend automation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/realtime/realtimekit/webhooks/)

Receive signed meeting, participant, and recording events in your backend. A [Cloudflare Worker](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/) can verify each callback and start post-meeting processing.

Handle lifecycle events

## Choose how to build

RealtimeKit gives you two ways to build the client experience. Choose based on how much of the interface you want to build yourself.

### RealtimeKit UI Kit

Use [RealtimeKit UI Kit](https://developers.cloudflare.com/realtime/realtimekit/ui-kit/) when you want prebuilt screens and controls for joining and running a call. It includes the setup screen, participant grid, media controls, chat, and polls. Use the default layout or customize individual components and branding.

RealtimeKit UI Kit includes RealtimeKit Core SDK, so you can use its APIs when prebuilt components don't cover your workflow.

### RealtimeKit Core SDK

Use [RealtimeKit Core SDK](https://developers.cloudflare.com/realtime/realtimekit/core/) to build every screen and interaction yourself. It provides direct access to session, participant, and media state while RealtimeKit manages signaling and media routing.
