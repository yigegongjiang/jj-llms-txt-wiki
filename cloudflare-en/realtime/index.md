# Cloudflare Realtime

Last updated Aug 27, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/realtime/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Build live audio, video, and data applications with managed Realtime products.

### RealtimeKit

[RealtimeKit](https://developers.cloudflare.com/realtime/realtimekit/) is a set of SDKs and APIs that lets you add customizable live video and voice to web or mobile applications. It is fully customisable and lets you set up in just a few lines of code.

It sits on top of the Realtime SFU, abstracting away the heavy lifting of media routing, peer management, and other complex WebRTC operations.

### Realtime SFU

The [Realtime SFU (Selective Forwarding Unit)](https://developers.cloudflare.com/realtime/sfu/) routes WebRTC audio, video, and DataChannels between application endpoints.

Use Realtime SFU when your application needs custom media routing, signaling, state, permissions, or user interfaces. Common topologies include custom calls, interactive broadcasts, AI media pipelines, cloud gaming, device control, and media processing.

Your application backend keeps the Realtime SFU credentials and decides which sessions can publish, subscribe, or control resources.

### TURN Service

The [TURN service](https://developers.cloudflare.com/realtime/turn/) is a managed service that acts as a relay for WebRTC traffic. It ensures connectivity for users behind restrictive firewalls or NATs by providing a public relay point for media streams.
