# Cloudflare Realtime

Last updated Jul 28, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/realtime/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Cloudflare Realtime is a comprehensive suite of products designed to help you build powerful, scalable real-time applications.

### RealtimeKit

[RealtimeKit](https://developers.cloudflare.com/realtime/realtimekit/) is a set of SDKs and APIs that lets you add customizable live video and voice to web or mobile applications. It is fully customisable and lets you set up in just a few lines of code.

It sits on top of the Realtime SFU, abstracting away the heavy lifting of media routing, peer management, and other complex WebRTC operations.

### Realtime SFU

The [Realtime SFU (Selective Forwarding Unit)](https://developers.cloudflare.com/realtime/sfu/) is a powerful media server that efficiently routes video and audio. The Realtime SFU runs on [Cloudflare's global cloud network ↗](https://www.cloudflare.com/network/) in hundreds of cities worldwide.

For developers with WebRTC expertise, the SFU can be used independently to build highly custom applications that require full control over media streams. This is recommended only for those who want to leverage Cloudflare's network with their own WebRTC logic.

### TURN Service

The [TURN service](https://developers.cloudflare.com/realtime/turn/) is a managed service that acts as a relay for WebRTC traffic. It ensures connectivity for users behind restrictive firewalls or NATs by providing a public relay point for media streams.
