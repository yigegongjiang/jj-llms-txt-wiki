# Event logs

Last updated Jul 20, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/spectrum/reference/logs/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Spectrum logs the entire lifecycle of every client that connects through it. These event logs are available through Logpush as a separate category (dataset type `spectrum_events`); they are not part of HTTP log events.

For each connection, Spectrum logs a connect event and either a disconnect or error event. Details on status codes can be found below.

## Configure Logpush

Spectrum [log events](https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/logpush/logpush-job/datasets/) can be configured through the dashboard or API, depending on your preferred [destination](https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/logpush/logpush-job/enable-destinations/).

## Status Codes

Spectrum status codes are not HTTP status codes

The status codes in the Spectrum status code table are Spectrum-specific connection status codes. They describe the outcome of Layer 4 (TCP/UDP) connections, not HTTP transactions. Some codes share numbers with HTTP status codes (for example, `444`, `499`) but have different meanings in the Spectrum context. For guidance on interpreting common status code patterns, refer to [Spectrum Troubleshooting](https://developers.cloudflare.com/spectrum/reference/troubleshooting/#common-spectrum-event-log-status-codes).
