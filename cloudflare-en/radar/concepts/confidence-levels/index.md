# Confidence levels

Last updated Apr 20, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/radar/concepts/confidence-levels/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

The `result.meta.confidenceInfo.level` in the response provides an indication of how much confidence Cloudflare has in the data. Confidence levels can be affected either by internal issues affecting data quality or by not having a lot of data for a given location (like Antarctica) or Autonomous System (AS).

| Level | Description                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ----- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1** | There is not enough data in this time range and/or for this location or Autonomous System. Data also exhibits an erratic pattern, possibly due to the reasons previously mentioned. |
| **2** | There is not enough data in this timerange and/or in this location or Autonomous System.                                                                                            |
| **3** | Data exhibits an erratic pattern but is not affected by known data issues (like pipeline issues).                                                                                   |
| **4** | Unassigned.                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **5** | No known data quality issues.                                                                                                                                                       |
