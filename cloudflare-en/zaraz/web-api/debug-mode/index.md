# Debug mode

Last updated Apr 16, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/zaraz/web-api/debug-mode/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Zaraz offers a debug mode to troubleshoot the events and triggers systems. To activate debug mode you need to create a special debug cookie (`zarazDebug`) containing your debug key. You can set this cookie manually or via the `zaraz.debug` helper function available in your console.

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Settings** page.  
[Go to **Settings** ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/tag-management/settings)
2. Copy your **Debug Key**.
3. Open a web browser and access its Developer Tools. For example, to access Developer Tools in Google Chrome, select **View** \> **Developer** \> **Developer Tools**.
4. Select the **Console** pane and enter the following command to create a debug cookie:  
```js  
zaraz.debug("YOUR_DEBUG_KEY")  
```

Zaraz’s debug mode is now enabled. A pop-up window will show up with the debugger information. To exit debug mode, remove the cookie by typing `zaraz.debug()` in the console pane of the browser.
