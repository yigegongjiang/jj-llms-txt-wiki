Last updated Jun 30, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cache/troubleshooting/edge-vs-cache-response-bytes/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

In [HTTP request logs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/logpush/logpush-job/datasets/zone/http%5Frequests/), `cacheResponseBytes` reflects the uncompressed response size from cache or origin. `edgeResponseBytes` reflects the final compressed response size sent to the client. Because Cloudflare applies compression (gzip, Brotli) before delivering to the client, `edgeResponseBytes` is typically smaller than `cacheResponseBytes`.
