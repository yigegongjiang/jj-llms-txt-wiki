# Control cache access with WAF and Snippets

Last updated May 7, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cache/interaction-cloudflare-products/waf-snippets/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

When you make an R2 bucket publicly accessible for caching (via a [Custom Domain](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/buckets/public-buckets/#custom-domains)), anyone who knows the URL can access the content. To restrict access, you can use Cloudflare's [WAF](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/custom-rules/use-cases/configure-token-authentication/) to validate requests before they reach the cache or your bucket.

The following diagram illustrates the flow of a request through WAF, Cache, and R2\. WAF custom rules run before cache rules in the [request pipeline](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/reference/phases-list/), so invalid requests are blocked before consuming cache resources.

## Presigned URLs

A presigned URL is a regular URL with a cryptographic token appended to it. The token contains a hash-based message authentication code (HMAC) computed from the URL path, a timestamp, and a secret key shared between the signing service and the validator. Anyone with the URL can access the content until the token expires, but the token cannot be reused for a different URL path.

You can presign URLs similar to [S3 ↗](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-presigned-url.html), enabling you to share direct access to your content with an associated timeout. This approach can be implemented using a combination of Snippets, Rules, or Cloudflare Workers.

For optimal performance, we recommend separating the creation and validation processes:

* [Snippets](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/snippets/examples/signing-requests/) for HMAC creation (signing the URL)
* [WAF custom rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/rules-language/functions/#hmac-validation) for HMAC validation (verifying the token on each request)

In the Workers documentation, the [Signing requests](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/examples/signing-requests/) example shows how to both generate and verify signed requests using HMAC. The Workers implementation is compatible with the WAF's [is\_timed\_hmac\_valid\_v0() validation function](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/custom-rules/use-cases/configure-token-authentication/), so you can sign with Workers and validate with WAF custom rules, or handle both in Workers.
