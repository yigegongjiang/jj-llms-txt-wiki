# Origin Cache Control

Last updated Jun 30, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cache/concepts/cache-control/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Origin Cache Control is a Cloudflare feature. When enabled on an Enterprise customer's website, it indicates that Cloudflare should strictly respect `Cache-Control` directives received from the origin server. Free, Pro and Business customers have this feature enabled by default.

`Cache-Control` directives in the HTTP response from your origin server provide specific [caching instructions ↗](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7234) to intermediary services like Cloudflare.

With the Origin Cache Control feature enabled, `Cache-Control` directives present in the origin server's response will be followed as specified. For example, if the response includes a `max-age` directive of 3,600 seconds, Cloudflare will cache the resource for that duration before checking the origin server again for updates.

Cloudflare's [Cache Rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cache/how-to/cache-rules/) allows users to either augment or override an origin server's `Cache-Control` headers or [default policies](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cache/concepts/default-cache-behavior/) set by Cloudflare.

The following sections cover:

* The most common `Cache-Control` directives.
* How to enable Origin Cache Control.
* How Origin Cache Control behaves with `Cache-Control` directives.
* How other Cloudflare products interact with `Cache-Control` directives.

## `Cache-control` directives

A `Cache-Control` header can include a number of directives, and the directive dictates who can cache a resource along with how long those resources can be cached before they must be updated.

Note

For more information about `Cache-Control` directives at origin servers, refer to the [Mozilla Cache-Control documentation ↗](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Cache-Control).

If multiple directives are passed together, each directive is separated by a comma. If the directive takes an argument, it follows the directive separated by an equal sign. For example: `max-age=86400`.

Directives can be broken down into four groups: [cacheability](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cache/concepts/cache-control/#cacheability), [expiration](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cache/concepts/cache-control/#expiration), [revalidation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cache/concepts/cache-control/#revalidation), and [other](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cache/concepts/cache-control/#other).

### Cacheability

Cacheability refers to whether or not a resource should enter a cache, and the directives below indicate a resource's cacheability.

* `public` — Indicates any cache may store the response, even if the response is normally non-cacheable or cacheable only within a private cache.
* `private` — Indicates the response message is intended for a single user, such as a browser cache, and must not be stored by a shared cache like Cloudflare or a corporate proxy.
* `no-store` — Indicates any cache, such as a client or proxy cache, must not store any part of either the immediate request or response.

### Expiration

Expiration refers to how long a resource should remain in the cache, and the directives below affect how long a resource stays in the cache.

Note

Cloudflare respects whichever value is higher: the [Browser Cache TTL](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cache/how-to/edge-browser-cache-ttl/) in Cloudflare or the `max-age` header. You can also simultaneously specify a Cloudflare Edge Cache TTL different than a Browser's Cache TTL respectively via the `s-maxage` and `max-age` `Cache-Control` headers.

When using Origin Cache Control and setting `max-age=0`, Cloudflare prefers to cache and revalidate. With Origin Cache Control off and `max-age=0`, Cloudflare will bypass cache.

When setting `no-cache` with Origin Cache Control off, Cloudflare does not cache. When setting `no-cache` with Origin Cache Control on, Cloudflare caches and always revalidates.

* `max-age=seconds` — Indicates the response is stale after its age is greater than the specified number of seconds. Age is defined as the time in seconds since the asset was served from the origin server. The `seconds` argument is an unquoted integer.
* `s-maxage=seconds` — Indicates that in shared caches, the maximum age specified by this directive overrides the maximum age specified by either the `max-age` directive or the `Expires` header field. The `s-maxage` directive also implies the semantics of the `proxy-revalidate` response directive. Browsers ignore `s-maxage`.

\`s-maxage\` disables \`stale-while-revalidate\`

Per [RFC 9111 ↗](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9111.html#section-5.2.2.10-4), `s-maxage` incorporates the semantics of `proxy-revalidate`, which means a shared cache must not serve stale content without first revalidating with the origin. For a complete list of directives that disable `stale-while-revalidate` and workarounds, refer to [Controlling stale behavior](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cache/concepts/revalidation/#controlling-stale-behavior).

* `no-cache` — Indicates the response cannot be used to satisfy a subsequent request without successful validation on the origin server. This allows an origin server to prevent a cache from using the origin to satisfy a request without contacting it, even by caches that have been configured to send stale responses.

Ensure the HTTP `Expires` header is set in your origin server to use Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) as stipulated in [RFC 2616 ↗](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec3.html#sec3.3 "3.3.1 Full Date").

### Revalidation

Revalidation determines how the cache should behave when a resource expires, and the directives below affect the revalidation behavior.

* `must-revalidate` — Indicates that once the resource is stale, a cache (client or proxy) must not use the response to satisfy subsequent requests without successful validation on the origin server.
* `proxy-revalidate` — Has the same meaning as the `must-revalidate` response directive except that it does not apply to private client caches.
* `stale-while-revalidate=<seconds>` — When present in an HTTP response, indicates caches may serve the response in which it appears after it becomes stale, up to the indicated number of seconds since the resource expired. If [Always Online](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cache/how-to/always-online/) is enabled, then the `stale-while-revalidate` and `stale-if-error` directives are ignored. This directive is not supported when using the Cache API methods `cache.match` or `cache.put`. For more information, refer to the [Workers documentation for Cache API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/cache/#methods).

Note

`stale-while-revalidate` is now fully asynchronous. The first request after expiry triggers revalidation in the background and immediately receives stale content with an UPDATING status instead of blocking. All requests during revalidation are served stale with an UPDATING status until the origin responds, after which they receive a HIT.

For more details, refer to [Revalidation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cache/concepts/revalidation/#asynchronous-revalidation).

* `stale-if-error=<seconds>` — Indicates that when an error is encountered, a cached stale response may be used to satisfy the request, regardless of other freshness information. To avoid this behavior, include `stale-if-error=0` directive with the object returned from the origin. This directive is not supported when using the Cache API methods `cache.match` or `cache.put`. For more information, refer to the [Workers documentation for Cache API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/cache/#methods).

Error status codes

The `stale-if-error` directive triggers when your origin returns a `5xx` status code (`500`, `502`, `503`, `504`). Other responses such as `404` are not considered errors for this purpose — the origin response replaces the stale cached content. There is currently no way to customize which status codes trigger `stale-if-error`.

The `stale-if-error` directive is ignored if [Always Online](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cache/how-to/always-online/) is enabled or if an explicit in-protocol directive is passed. Examples of explicit in-protocol directives include a `no-store` or `no-cache cache` directive, a `must-revalidate` cache-response-directive, or an applicable `s-maxage` or `proxy-revalidate` cache-response-directive.

### Other

Additional directives that influence cache behavior are listed below.

* `no-transform` — Indicates that an intermediary — regardless of whether it implements a cache — must not transform the payload.
* `vary` — By default, Cloudflare does not consider vary values in caching decisions. Vary values are respected when you configure the [Cache Rules Vary setting](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cache/concepts/vary/), when [Vary for images](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cache/advanced-configuration/vary-for-images/) is configured, and when the vary header is [vary: accept-encoding](https://developers.cloudflare.com/speed/optimization/content/compression/).
* `immutable` — Indicates to clients the response body does not change over time. The resource, if unexpired, is unchanged on the server. The user should not send a conditional revalidation request, such as `If-None-Match` or `If-Modified-Since`, to check for updates, even when the user explicitly refreshes the page. This directive has no effect on public caches like Cloudflare, but does change browser behavior.

### Understand `no-store` and `no-cache` directives

There is often confusion between the directives `Cache-Control: no-store` and `Cache-Control: no-cache`, particularly regarding how they impact browser caching and features like the [Back-Forward Cache ↗](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/bfcache) (BFCache).

#### `no-store`

* Tells both browsers and intermediaries (like CDNs) not to store a copy of the response under any circumstance.
* The response is never written to disk or memory, which means the browser must fetch it again every time.
* In many browsers, `no-store` disables BFCache, because restoring a page from BFCache requires the browser to keep a copy of the page's memory state, which contradicts the “do not store” directive.
* This directive is used for highly sensitive or dynamic data (for example, banking apps, personal information, secure dashboards).

#### `no-cache`

* Allows storing of the response (in both browser and intermediate caches), but requires revalidation with the origin server before using it.
* This ensures the content is always up-to-date, while still potentially allowing BFCache or other forms of performance optimization.
* This directive is used for data that changes frequently but is not sensitive, and can be served faster if validated rather than re-downloaded.

For more information about how these directives behave when Origin Cache Control is enabled or disabled refer to the [Directives](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cache/concepts/cache-control/#directives) section.

## Enable Origin Cache Control

If you enable Origin Cache Control, Cloudflare will aim to strictly adhere to [RFC 7234 ↗](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7234). Enterprise customers have the ability to select if Cloudflare will adhere to this behavior, enabling or disabling Origin Cache Control for their websites through cache rules in the [dashboard](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cache/how-to/cache-rules/settings/#origin-cache-control-enterprise-only) or via [API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cache/how-to/cache-rules/settings/#origin-cache-control-enterprise-only). Free, Pro, and Business customers have this option enabled by default and cannot disable it.

## Origin Cache Control behavior

The following section covers the directives and behavioral conditions associated with enabling or disabling Origin Cache Control.

Integer values required

The `max-age`, `s-maxage`, and `stale-while-revalidate` directives require integer values per RFC 9111\. Floating-point values (for example, `max-age=2.5`) are not valid and will be ignored, potentially causing cache bypass. Ensure your origin returns integer TTL values.

### Directives

The table below lists directives and their behaviors when Origin Cache Control is disabled and when it is enabled.

| Directive               | Origin Cache Control Disabled Behavior          | Origin Cache Control Enabled Behavior                                                                                                        |

### Conditions

Certain scenarios also affect Origin Cache Control behavior when it is enabled or disabled.

| Condition                                                              | Origin Cache Control disabled behavior                      | Origin Cache Control enabled behavior                        | |  Presence of Authorization header. | Content may be cached. | Content is cached only if must-revalidate, public, or s-maxage is also present. |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Use of no-cache header.                                                | In logs, cacheStatus=miss.                                  | In logs, cacheStatus=bypass.                                 |                                      |                        |                                                                                 |
| Origin response has Set-Cookie header and default cache level is used. | Content may be cached with stripped set-cookie header.      | Content is not cached.                                       |                                      |                        |                                                                                 |
| Browser Cache TTL is set.                                              | Cache-Control returned to eyeball does not include private. | If origin returns private in Cache-Control then preserve it. |                                      |                        |                                                                                 |

Note

When the `Cloudflare-Cdn-Cache-Control` header is set, OCC is turned **on** (regardless of whether OCC is enabled or disabled). As a result, we apply our Authorization header logic (per [RFC 7234, Section 3.2 ↗](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7234#section-3.2)) to allow only the `s-maxage`, `must-revalidate`, or `public` directives. If any other directive is present, we do not cache the asset and instead return `BYPASS`.

## Examples

Review the examples below to learn which directives to use with the `Cache-Control` header to control specific caching behavior.

Cache a static asset.

`Cache-Control: public, max-age=86400`

Ensure a secret asset is never cached.

`Cache-Control: no-store`

Cache assets on browsers but not on proxy cache.

`Cache-Control: private, max-age=3600`

Cache assets in client and proxy caches, but prefer revalidation when serve.

`Cache-Control: public, no-cache`

Cache assets in proxy caches but REQUIRE revalidation by the proxy when serve.

`Cache-Control: public, no-cache, proxy-revalidate` or `Cache-Control: public, s-maxage=0`

Cache assets in proxy caches, but REQUIRE revalidation by any cache when serve.

`Cache-Control: public, no-cache, must-revalidate`

Cache assets, but ensure the proxy does not modify it.

`Cache-Control: public, no-transform`

This configuration also disables transformation like gzip or brotli compression from our edge to your visitors if the original payload was served uncompressed.

Cache assets with revalidation, but allow stale responses if origin server is unreachable.

`Cache-Control: public, max-age=3600, stale-if-error=60`

With this configuration, Cloudflare attempts to revalidate the content with the origin server after it has been in cache for 3600 seconds (one hour). If the server returns an error instead of proper revalidation responses, Cloudflare continues serving the stale resource for a total of one minute beyond the expiration of the resource.

Cache assets for different amounts of time on Cloudflare and in visitor browsers.

`Cache-Control: public, max-age=7200, s-maxage=3600`

Cache an asset and serve while asset is being revalidated.

`Cache-Control: max-age=600, stale-while-revalidate=30`

This configuration indicates the asset is fresh for 600 seconds. The asset can be served stale for up to an additional 30 seconds while Cloudflare revalidates the asset with the origin in the background. For more information, refer to [Revalidation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cache/concepts/revalidation/).

Note

Do not use `s-maxage` with `stale-while-revalidate`. The `s-maxage` directive implies `proxy-revalidate`, which prevents shared caches from serving stale content. For workarounds, refer to [Controlling stale behavior](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cache/concepts/revalidation/#controlling-stale-behavior).

## Interaction with other Cloudflare features

This section covers how other Cloudflare features interact with `Cache-Control` directives.

### Edge Cache TTL

[Edge Cache TTL](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cache/how-to/edge-browser-cache-ttl/#edge-cache-ttl) Cache Rules override `s-maxage` and disable revalidation directives if present. When Origin Cache Control is enabled at Cloudflare, the original `Cache-Control` header passes downstream from our edge even if Edge Cache TTL overrides are present. Otherwise, when Origin Cache Control is disabled at Cloudflare, Cloudflare overrides the Origin Cache Control.

### Browser Cache TTL

[Browser Cache TTL](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cache/how-to/edge-browser-cache-ttl/#browser-cache-ttl) Cache Rules override `max-age` settings passed downstream from our edge, typically to your visitor's browsers.

### Polish

[Polish](https://developers.cloudflare.com/images/polish/) is disabled when the `no-transform` directive is present.

### Gzip and Other Compression

Compression is disabled when the `no-transform` directive is present. If the original asset fetched from the origin is compressed, it is served compressed to the visitor. If the original asset is uncompressed, compression is not applied.

### JavaScript Detections

[JavaScript Detections](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-challenges/challenge-types/javascript-detections/) injection is disabled when the `no-transform` directive is present. The `cf.bot_management.js_detection.passed` field will show as `missing` for affected requests.
