# Manage gateways

Last updated Aug 7, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/configuration/manage-gateway/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

You have several different options for managing an AI Gateway.

## Create gateway

### Default gateway

AI Gateway can automatically create a gateway for you. If you omit the gateway ID from your request entirely, AI Gateway defaults to using `default` as the gateway ID. When no gateway named `default` exists in your account, AI Gateway creates it on the first authenticated request.

This means you can start sending requests without creating a gateway first — AI Gateway handles gateway creation for you.

The request that triggers auto-creation must be authenticated. When using the [REST API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/usage/rest-api/), the standard `Authorization` header is sufficient. When using [provider-native endpoints](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/usage/providers/) at `gateway.ai.cloudflare.com`, include a valid `cf-aig-authorization` header. For Workers AI bindings, the account identity from the binding is used instead of a header.

The auto-created default gateway uses the following settings:

| Setting            | Default value    |
| ------------------ | ---------------- |
| Authentication     | On               |
| Log collection     | On               |
| Caching            | Off (TTL of 0)   |
| Rate limiting      | Off              |
| Workers AI billing | Standard billing |

After creation, you can edit the default gateway settings like any other gateway. If you delete the default gateway, sending a new authenticated request to the `default` gateway ID auto-creates it again.

Note

Auto-creation only applies to the gateway ID `default`. Using any other gateway ID requires creating the gateway first.

### Create a gateway manually

[Go to **AI Gateway** ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/ai/ai-gateway)
1. Log into the [Cloudflare dashboard ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) and select your account.
2. Go to **AI** \> **AI Gateway**.
3. Select **Create Gateway**.
4. Enter your **Gateway name**. Note: Gateway name has a 64 character limit.
5. In **Workers AI Billing**, choose how Workers AI requests through this gateway are billed:  
  * **Standard billing** charges your Cloudflare account at the end of each billing cycle.
  * **Unified billing** deducts from your prepaid AI Gateway credit balance in real time.
6. Select **Create**.

To set up an AI Gateway using the API:

1. [Create an API token](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/get-started/create-token/) with the following permissions:

  * `AI Gateway - Read`
  * `AI Gateway - Edit`
2. Get your [Account ID](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/account/find-account-and-zone-ids/).
3. Using that API token and Account ID, send a [POST request](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/ai%5Fgateway/methods/create/) to the Cloudflare API.

## Edit gateway

To edit an AI Gateway in the dashboard:

1. Log into the [Cloudflare dashboard ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) and select your account.
2. Go to **AI** \> **AI Gateway**.
3. Select your gateway.
4. Go to **Settings** and update as needed.

To edit an AI Gateway, send a [PUT request](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/ai%5Fgateway/methods/update/) to the Cloudflare API.

Note

For more details about what settings are available for editing, refer to [Configuration](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/configuration/).

### Configure Workers AI billing

By default, Workers AI requests use **Standard billing**, which charges your Cloudflare account at the end of each billing cycle.

To use prepaid AI Gateway credits for Workers AI requests:

1. [Load credits](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/features/unified-billing/#load-credits) into your Cloudflare account.
2. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to **AI** \> **AI Gateway** and select your gateway.
3. Go to **Settings** and find **Workers AI Billing**.
4. Select **Unified billing**.
5. Select **Save**.

Workers AI requests routed through this gateway will deduct from your AI Gateway credit balance in real time.

## Retry requests

You can configure your gateway to automatically retry failed requests to upstream providers. This is useful when you do not control the client and cannot implement client-side retries or backoff logic.

To configure retry settings:

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) and select your account.
2. Go to **AI** \> **AI Gateway** and select your gateway.
3. Go to **Settings** and find the **Retry Requests** section.
4. Turn on the toggle to turn on automatic retries.
5. Configure the following settings:  
  * **Retry count** — the maximum number of retry attempts (up to 5).
  * **Delay** — the base delay between retries. Available values: 100ms, 500ms, 1 second, 2 seconds, 3 seconds, or 5 seconds.
  * **Backoff** — the backoff strategy for subsequent retries: Constant, Linear, or Exponential.
6. Select **Save**.

These gateway-level defaults apply to all requests routed through the gateway. Per-request headers can override these defaults — refer to [Request handling](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/configuration/request-handling/#request-retries) for details.

For more complex failover scenarios where you need to fail across different providers, refer to [Dynamic Routing](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/features/dynamic-routing/).

## Delete gateway

Deleting your gateway is permanent and can not be undone.

To delete an AI Gateway in the dashboard:

1. Log into the [Cloudflare dashboard ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) and select your account.
2. Go to **AI** \> **AI Gateway**.
3. Select your gateway from the list of available options.
4. Go to **Settings**.
5. For **Delete Gateway**, select **Delete** (and confirm your deletion).

To delete an AI Gateway, send a [DELETE request](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/ai%5Fgateway/methods/delete/) to the Cloudflare API.
