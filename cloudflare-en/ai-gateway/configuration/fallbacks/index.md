# Fallbacks

Last updated Apr 20, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/configuration/fallbacks/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Specify model or provider fallbacks with your [Universal endpoint](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/usage/universal/) to handle request failures and ensure reliability.

Cloudflare can trigger your fallback provider in response to [request errors](#request-failures) or [predetermined request timeouts](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/configuration/request-handling#request-timeouts). The [response header cf-aig-step](#response-headercf-aig-step) indicates which step successfully processed the request.

## Request failures

By default, Cloudflare triggers your fallback if a model request returns an error.

### Example

In the following example, a request first goes to the [Workers AI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/) Inference API. If the request fails, it falls back to OpenAI. The response header `cf-aig-step` indicates which provider successfully processed the request.

1. Sends a request to Workers AI Inference API.
2. If that request fails, proceeds to OpenAI.

graph TD
    A[AI Gateway] --> B[Request to Workers AI Inference API]
    B -->|Success| C[Return Response]
    B -->|Failure| D[Request to OpenAI API]
    D --> E[Return Response]

  
You can add as many fallbacks as you need, just by adding another object in the array.

```bash
curl https://gateway.ai.cloudflare.com/v1/{account_id}/{gateway_id} \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '[
  {
    "provider": "workers-ai",
    "endpoint": "@cf/meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct",
    "headers": {
      "Authorization": "Bearer {cloudflare_token}",
      "Content-Type": "application/json"
    },
    "query": {
      "messages": [
        {
          "role": "system",
          "content": "You are a friendly assistant"
        },
        {
          "role": "user",
          "content": "What is Cloudflare?"
        }
      ]
    }
  },
  {
    "provider": "openai",
    "endpoint": "chat/completions",
    "headers": {
      "Authorization": "Bearer {open_ai_token}",
      "Content-Type": "application/json"
    },
    "query": {
      "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
      "stream": true,
      "messages": [
        {
          "role": "user",
          "content": "What is Cloudflare?"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
]'
```

## Response header(cf-aig-step)

When using the [Universal endpoint](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/usage/universal/) with fallbacks, the response header `cf-aig-step` indicates which model successfully processed the request by returning the step number. This header provides visibility into whether a fallback was triggered and which model ultimately processed the response.

* `cf-aig-step:0` – The first (primary) model was used successfully.
* `cf-aig-step:1` – The request fell back to the second model.
* `cf-aig-step:2` – The request fell back to the third model.
* Subsequent steps – Each fallback increments the step number by 1.
