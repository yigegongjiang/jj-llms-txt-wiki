# Set up Data Loss Prevention (DLP)

Last updated Apr 20, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/features/dlp/set-up-dlp/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Add Data Loss Prevention (DLP) to any AI Gateway to start scanning AI prompts and responses for sensitive data.

## Prerequisites

* An existing [AI Gateway](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/get-started/)

## Enable DLP for AI Gateway

1. Log into the [Cloudflare dashboard ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) and select your account.
2. Go to **AI** \> **AI Gateway**.
3. Select a gateway where you want to enable DLP.
4. Go to the **Firewall** tab.
5. Toggle **Data Loss Prevention (DLP)** to **On**.

## Add DLP policies

After enabling DLP, you can create policies to define how sensitive data should be handled:

1. Under the DLP section, click **Add Policy**.
2. Configure the following fields for each policy:

  * **Policy ID**: Enter a unique name for this policy (e.g., "Block-PII-Requests")
  * **DLP Profiles**: Select the DLP profiles to check against. AI requests/responses will be checked against each of the selected profiles. Available profiles include:

    * **Financial Information** \- Credit cards, bank accounts, routing numbers
    * **Personal Identifiable Information (PII)** \- Names, addresses, phone numbers
    * **Government Identifiers** \- SSNs, passport numbers, driver's licenses
    * **Healthcare Information** \- Medical record numbers, patient data
    * **Custom Profiles** \- Organization-specific data patterns  
  Note  
  DLP profiles can be created and managed in the [Zero Trust DLP dashboard](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/data-loss-prevention/dlp-profiles/).
  * **Action**: Choose the action to take when any of the selected profiles match:

    * **Flag** \- Record the detection for audit purposes without blocking
    * **Block** \- Prevent the request/response from proceeding
  * **Check**: Select what to scan:

    * **Request** \- Scan user prompts sent to AI providers
    * **Response** \- Scan AI model responses before returning to users
    * **Both** \- Scan both requests and responses
3. Click **Save** to save your policy configuration.

## Manage DLP policies

You can create multiple DLP policies with different configurations:

* **Add multiple policies**: Click **Add Policy** to create additional policies with different profile combinations or actions
* **Enable/disable policies**: Use the toggle next to each policy to individually enable or disable them without deleting the configuration
* **Edit policies**: Click on any existing policy to modify its settings
* **Save changes**: Always click **Save** after making any changes to apply them

## Test your configuration

After configuring DLP settings:

1. Make a test AI request through your gateway that contains sample sensitive data.
2. Check the **AI Gateway Logs** to verify DLP scanning is working.
3. Review the detection results and adjust profiles or actions as needed.

## Monitor DLP events

### Viewing DLP logs in AI Gateway

DLP events are integrated into your AI Gateway logs. When a DLP policy matches, the log entry includes details about the match alongside standard log fields like provider, model, tokens, and cost.

1. Go to **AI** \> **AI Gateway** \> your gateway > **Logs**.
2. Select any log entry to view detailed information. For requests where DLP policies were triggered, the log entry includes additional DLP fields:

| Field                | Description                                                           |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| DLP Action           | The action taken by the DLP policy: FLAG or BLOCK                     |
| DLP Policies Matched | The IDs of the DLP policies that matched                              |
| DLP Profiles Matched | The IDs of the DLP profiles that triggered within each matched policy |
| DLP Entries Matched  | The specific detection entry IDs that matched within each profile     |
| DLP Check            | Whether the match occurred in the REQUEST, RESPONSE, or both          |

### DLP fields in the Logs API

When you retrieve logs through the [Logs API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/ai%5Fgateway/subresources/logs/methods/list/), log entries for requests where DLP policies matched include DLP-specific fields in the response. These fields contain the same match data surfaced in the dashboard and in the `cf-aig-dlp` response header, including the action taken, matched policy IDs, matched profile IDs, and entry IDs.

For more information on log fields, refer to the [Logging documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/observability/logging/).

### Filter DLP events

To view only DLP-related requests:

1. On the **Logs** tab, select **Add Filter**.
2. Select **DLP Action** from the filter options.
3. Choose to filter by:  
  * **FLAG** \- Show only requests where sensitive data was flagged
  * **BLOCK** \- Show only requests that were blocked due to DLP policies

## Error handling

When DLP policies are triggered, your application will receive additional information through response headers and error codes.

### DLP response header

When a request matches DLP policies (whether flagged or blocked), an additional `cf-aig-dlp` header is returned containing detailed information about the match:

#### Header schema

```json
{
  "findings": [
    {
      "profile": {
        "context": {},
        "entry_ids": ["string"],
        "profile_id": "string"
      },
      "policy_ids": ["string"],
      "check": "REQUEST" | "RESPONSE"
    }
  ],
  "action": "BLOCK" | "FLAG"
}
```

#### Example header value

```json
{
	"findings": [
		{
			"profile": {
				"context": {},
				"entry_ids": [
					"a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890",
					"f7e8d9c0-b1a2-3456-789a-bcdef0123456"
				],
				"profile_id": "12345678-90ab-cdef-1234-567890abcdef"
			},
			"policy_ids": ["block_financial_data"],
			"check": "REQUEST"
		}
	],
	"action": "BLOCK"
}
```

Use this header to programmatically detect which DLP profiles and entries were matched, which policies triggered, and whether the match occurred in the request or response.

### Error codes for blocked requests

When DLP blocks a request, your application will receive structured error responses:

* **Request blocked by DLP**

  * `"code": 2029`
  * `"message": "Request content blocked due to DLP policy violations"`
* **Response blocked by DLP**

  * `"code": 2030`
  * `"message": "Response content blocked due to DLP policy violations"`

Handle these errors in your application:

```js
try {
  const res = await env.AI.run('@cf/meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct', {
    prompt: userInput
  }, {
    gateway: {id: 'your-gateway-id'}
  })
  return Response.json(res)
} catch (e) {
  if ((e as Error).message.includes('2029')) {
    return new Response('Request contains sensitive data and cannot be processed.')
  }
  if ((e as Error).message.includes('2030')) {
    return new Response('AI response was blocked due to sensitive content.')
  }
  return new Response('AI request failed')
}
```

## Best practices

* **Start with flagging**: Begin with "Flag" actions to understand what data is being detected before implementing blocking
* **Tune confidence levels**: Adjust detection sensitivity based on your false positive tolerance
* **Use appropriate profiles**: Select DLP profiles that match your data protection requirements
* **Monitor regularly**: Review DLP events to ensure policies are working as expected
* **Test thoroughly**: Validate DLP behavior with sample sensitive data before production deployment

## Troubleshooting

For general AI Gateway troubleshooting, refer to [Troubleshooting](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/reference/troubleshooting/).

### DLP not triggering

* Verify DLP toggle is enabled for your gateway
* Ensure selected DLP profiles are appropriate for your test data
* Confirm confidence levels aren't set too high

### Unexpected blocking

* Review DLP logs to see which profiles triggered
* Consider lowering confidence levels for problematic profiles
* Test with different sample data to understand detection patterns
* Adjust profile selections if needed
