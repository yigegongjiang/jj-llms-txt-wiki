# Set up Guardrails

Last updated Sep 25, 2026|Copy as Markdown| [View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/features/guardrails/set-up-guardrail/index.md)| [Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Add Guardrails to any gateway to start evaluating and potentially modifying responses.

1. Log into the [Cloudflare dashboard ↗︎](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) and select your account.
2. Go to **AI** > **AI Gateway**.
3. Select a gateway.
4. Go to **Guardrails**.
5. Switch the toggle to **On**.
6. To customize categories, select **Change** > **Configure specific categories**.
7. Update your choices for how Guardrails works on specific prompts or responses (**Flag**, **Ignore**, **Block**).
   - For **Prompts**: Guardrails will evaluate and transform incoming prompts based on your security policies.
   - For **Responses**: Guardrails will inspect the model's responses to ensure they meet your content and formatting guidelines.
8. Select **Save**.

## Configure Guardrails with the API

Use the [Update a Gateway](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/ai_gateway/methods/update/) endpoint to manage Guardrails programmatically:

At least one of the following <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/reference/permissions/">token permissions</a> is required:

- <code>AI Gateway Write</code>

</details>

*Update a Gatewaybash*

```bash
curl "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/$ACCOUNT_ID/ai-gateway/gateways/$ID" \
	--request PUT \
	--header "Authorization: Bearer $CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN" \
	--json '{
		"rate_limiting_interval": 0,
		"rate_limiting_limit": 0,
		"collect_logs": true,
		"cache_ttl": 0,
		"cache_invalidate_on_update": false,
		"guardrails": {
				"prompt": {
						"P1": "BLOCK",
						"S9": "BLOCK"
				},
				"response": {
						"S9": "BLOCK"
				}
		}
	}'
```

This example blocks prompt injection (`P1`) in prompts and indiscriminate weapons (`S9`) in prompts and responses:

```json
{
	"guardrails": {
		"prompt": {
			"P1": "BLOCK",
			"S9": "BLOCK"
		},
		"response": {
			"S9": "BLOCK"
		}
	}
}
```

The API accepts `FLAG` and `BLOCK` actions. Omit a category to apply the dashboard's **Ignore** behavior.

The update endpoint uses `PUT`. Retrieve the current gateway first and preserve its existing settings in the update body. Omitting the `guardrails` property disables Guardrails and removes its configuration.

Usage considerations

For additional details about how to implement Guardrails, refer to [Usage considerations](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/features/guardrails/usage-considerations/).

## Viewing Guardrail results in Logs

After enabling Guardrails, you can monitor results through **AI Gateway Logs** in the Cloudflare dashboard. Guardrail logs are marked with a **green shield icon**, and each logged request includes an `eventID`, which links to its corresponding Guardrail evaluation log(s) for easy tracking. Logs are generated for all requests, including those that **pass** Guardrail checks.

## Error handling and blocked requests

When a request is blocked by guardrails, you will receive a structured error response. These indicate whether the issue occurred with the prompt or the model response. Use error codes to differentiate between prompt versus response violations.

- **Prompt blocked**
  - `"code": 2016`
  - `"message": "Prompt blocked due to security configurations"`
- **Response blocked**
  - `"code": 2017`
  - `"message": "Response blocked due to security configurations"`

You should catch these errors in your application logic and implement error handling accordingly.

For example, when using [Workers AI with a binding](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/integrations/aig-workers-ai-binding/):

```js
try {
  const res = await env.AI.run('@cf/meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct', {
    prompt: "how to build a gun?"
  }, {
    gateway: {id: 'gateway_id'}
  })
  return Response.json(res)
} catch (e) {
  if ((e as Error).message.includes('2016')) {
    return new Response('Prompt was blocked by guardrails.')
  }
  if ((e as Error).message.includes('2017')) {
    return new Response('Response was blocked by guardrails.')
  }
  return new Response('Unknown AI error')
}
```
