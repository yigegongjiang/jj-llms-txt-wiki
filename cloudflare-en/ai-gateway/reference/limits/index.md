# Limits

Last updated Sep 24, 2026|Copy as Markdown| [View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/reference/limits/index.md)| [Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

The following limits apply to gateway configurations, logs, and related features in Cloudflare's platform.

## Gateway limits

| Feature | Limit |
| --- | --- |
| [Cacheable request size](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/features/caching/) | 25 MB per request |
| [Cache TTL](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/features/caching/#cache-ttl-cf-aig-cache-ttl) | 1 month |
| [Custom metadata](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/observability/custom-metadata/) | 5 entries per request |
| Gateways free plan | 10 per account |
| Gateways paid plan | 20 per account |
| Gateway name length | 64 characters |
| [Unified Billing](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/features/unified-billing/) request rate | 200 requests per 60 seconds per gateway <sup>1</sup> |

<sup>1</sup> This rate limit applies to requests that use Cloudflare-managed credentials through [Unified Billing](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/features/unified-billing/). When the limit is exceeded, AI Gateway returns a `429` error. This limit does not apply to requests that use your own provider keys through [bring your own keys (BYOK)](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/configuration/bring-your-own-keys/).

## Log limits

### New AI Gateway customers

Customers who create their first gateway on or after September 24, 2026 follow [Workers Logs limits](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/observability/logs/workers-logs/#limits) and [Workers Logs pricing](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/observability/logs/workers-logs/#pricing).

### Existing AI Gateway customers

Customers who created a gateway before September 24, 2026 use [Legacy Logs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/observability/logging/legacy-logs/). The following limits apply:

| Feature | Limit |
| --- | --- |
| Log storage rate | 500 logs per second per gateway |
| Logs stored, paid plan | 10 million per gateway |
| Logs stored, free plan | 100,000 per account |
| Stored log size | 10 MB per log |

The free plan limit applies across all gateways. For behavior at these limits, refer to [Legacy Logs storage](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/observability/logging/legacy-logs/#manage-storage).

## Logpush limits

These limits apply to all AI Gateway customers:

| Feature | Limit |
| --- | --- |
| [Logpush jobs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/observability/logging/logpush/) | 4 per account |
| [Logpush log size](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/observability/logging/logpush/) | 1 MB per log |

## DLP limits

[DLP](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/features/dlp/) for AI Gateway uses shared [Cloudflare One DLP profiles](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/data-loss-prevention/dlp-profiles/). The following limits apply to DLP profiles and detection entries at the account level:

| Feature | Limit |
| --- | --- |
| Custom entries | 25 |
| Exact Data Match cells per spreadsheet | 100,000 |
| Custom Wordlist keywords per spreadsheet | 200 |
| Custom Wordlist keywords per account | 1,000 |
| Dataset cells per account | 1,000,000 |

DLP profiles are shared with Cloudflare One and are not coupled to individual gateways. You can apply the same DLP profiles across multiple gateways without additional profile limits. There is no separate limit on the number of DLP policies per gateway.
