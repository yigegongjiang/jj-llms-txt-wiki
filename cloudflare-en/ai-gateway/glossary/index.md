## Configuration hierarchy

Settings in AI Gateway can be configured at two levels: **Request** and **Gateway**. Since the same settings can be configured in multiple locations, the following hierarchy determines which value is applied:

1. **Request-level headers**: Headers included in individual requests take precedence over gateway-level settings.
2. **Gateway-level settings**: Act as the default if no headers are set at the request level.

This hierarchy ensures consistent behavior, prioritizing the most specific configurations. Use request-level headers for fine-tuned control, and gateway settings for general defaults.
