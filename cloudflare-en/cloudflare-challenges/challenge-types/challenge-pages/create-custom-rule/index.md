# Implement a Challenge Page via WAF custom rules

Last updated May 6, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-challenges/challenge-types/challenge-pages/create-custom-rule/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

You can implement a Challenge Page to your website or application by creating a [WAF custom rule](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/custom-rules/).

Challenges are triggered by a rule in the [Web Application Firewall (WAF)](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/), [Bot Management](https://developers.cloudflare.com/bots/), or [Rate limiting](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/rate-limiting-rules/).

* **Bot Management**: Challenge visitors that appear automated based on their [bot score](https://developers.cloudflare.com/bots/concepts/bot-score/) or a specific [detection ID](https://developers.cloudflare.com/bots/additional-configurations/detection-ids/).
* **Rate limiting**: Challenge visitors who exceed your configured [rate limits](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/rate-limiting-rules/).
