# Challenge solve issues

Last updated Jul 10, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-challenges/troubleshooting/challenge-solve-issues/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

## Challenge loops

You may encounter a challenge loop where the challenge keeps reappearing without being solved. This is in very specific cases where we detect strong bot signals. If you are a legitimate human, you can follow the troubleshooting guide below to resolve the issue or submit a feedback report. Challenge loops can happen for several reasons:

* **Network issues**: Poor or unstable network connections can prevent the challenge from being completed.
* **Browser configuration**: Some browser settings or extensions may block the scripts needed to execute the challenge.
* **Unsupported browsers**: Using a browser that is not supported by Turnstile.
* **JavaScript disabled**: Turnstile relies on JavaScript to function properly.
* **Detection errors**: If Turnstile suspects bot-like behavior, you may encounter repeated challenges for verification.

Most challenges are quick to complete and typically take only a few seconds. If it takes longer, ensure your network is stable and follow the [troubleshooting steps](#troubleshooting).

Note

If the issue persists, try switching to a different network or device to rule out any issues with your browser environment.

Ensure your browser is updated to the latest version to maintain compatibility.

## 401 response on a Private Access Token request

When a Challenge Page loads, the browser may request a [Private Access Token (PAT)](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-challenges/reference/private-access-tokens/) from a `/cdn-cgi/challenge-platform/.../pat/...` endpoint. On devices, browsers, or networks that cannot issue a token, this request returns an HTTP `401`.

This response is **expected** and does not mean the visitor was blocked or that the widget failed. Cloudflare falls back to a standard challenge and the visitor proceeds as normal. A `401` on this request — for example, one seen in browser developer tools or a HAR capture — is not, on its own, a sign of a misconfiguration, a false positive, or a block. For more details, refer to [Private Access Tokens](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-challenges/reference/private-access-tokens/).

## Failed subdomain network requests during Turnstile challenges

When looking at browser developer tools or capturing a HAR for Turnstile, it is not uncommon to notice certain requests to specific subdomains failing due to DNS host lookup errors. These subdomains live under the parent domain of `challenges.cloudflare.com` and the requests are part of Turnstile's normal execution. That said, these errors should not be perceived as failure root causes, as they are **non-blocking** to visitors.

Given that these DNS host lookup failures are **expected** and **non-fatal** for Turnstile's execution, avoid surfacing them as fatal execution errors, especially in the case of handler-based integrations of Turnstile such as WebView embeddings. For more fine-grained control, consider dropping network errors originating from requests to the `*.challenges.cloudflare.com` wildcard while preserving error visibility for the `challenges.cloudflare.com` apex.

## Troubleshooting

Follow the steps below to ensure that your environment is properly configured.

1. Verify your browser compatibility.  
  * Turnstile supports all major browsers, except Internet Explorer.
  * Ensure your browser is up to date. For more information, refer to our [Supported browsers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-challenges/reference/supported-browsers/).
  * Run a test on the [compatibility checking tool ↗](https://debug.challenges.cloudflare.com/).
2. Disable your browser extensions.  
  * Some browser extensions, such as ad blockers, may block the scripts Turnstile needs to operate.
  * Temporarily disable all extensions and reload the page.
3. Enable JavaScript.  
  * Turnstile requires JavaScript to run. Ensure it is enabled in your browser settings. Refer to your browser's documentation for instructions on enabling JavaScript.
4. Try Incognito or Private mode.  
  * Use your browser's incognito or private mode to rule out issues caused by extensions or cached data.
5. Test another browser or device.  
  * Switch to a different browser or device to see if the issue is specific to your current setup.
6. Avoid VPNs or proxies.  
  * Some virtual private networks (VPN) or proxies may interfere with Turnstile. Disable them temporarily to test.
7. Switch to a different network.  
  * Your current network may have restrictions causing Turnstile challenges to fail. Try switching to another network, such as a mobile hotspot.

If none of the above resolves your issue, contact the website administrator with the [error code](https://developers.cloudflare.com/turnstile/troubleshooting/client-side-errors/error-codes/) and Ray ID or submit a [feedback report](https://developers.cloudflare.com/turnstile/troubleshooting/feedback-reports/) through the Turnstile widget by selecting **Submit Feedback**.
