# Manage account secrets

Last updated Apr 16, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/secrets-store/manage-secrets/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Secrets can be API tokens, public/private keys, authorization keys, passwords, or even code variables. The only limitation is that a secret must be a string that does not exceed 1024 bytes.

Once a secret is added to the Secrets Store, it can no longer be decrypted or accessed via API or on the dashboard. Only the service associated with a given secret will be able to access it.

## Limits

Customers who create a secrets store in the open beta can have up to 100 secrets per account. Also, there can only be one store per account.

Production secrets

If you use [Wrangler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/secrets-store/manage-secrets/how-to/#manage-via-wrangler), there is a difference between production secrets and secrets that are only created locally (without the `--remote` flag). The limit of 100 secrets per account only considers production secrets.
