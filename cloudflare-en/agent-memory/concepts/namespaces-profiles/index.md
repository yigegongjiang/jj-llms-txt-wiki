# Namespaces and profiles

Last updated Jun 2, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-memory/concepts/namespaces-profiles/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Agent Memory uses a two-level isolation model: **namespaces** define memory domains, and **profiles** provide isolated memory stores for individual users, agents, teams, tenants, or application objects.

## Namespaces

A namespace is a top-level container that scopes a set of memory profiles. Use namespaces to separate applications, environments, tenants, or memory layers such as user, team, and organization memory.

## Profiles

A profile is an isolated memory store for a single entity. Each profile has its own stored memories and retrieval indexes.

## Sessions

A session groups memories that come from the same interaction or conversation. Sessions are optional, but they make it easier to identify, inspect, and manage memories created from a specific conversation.

Sessions are scoped to a profile. Two different profiles can use the same session ID without conflict.

## Isolation model

Conceptually, memories are scoped as `namespace > profile > memory`. No data crosses these boundaries:

```txt
Namespace: my-assistant-prod
  Profile: alice
    Memories
    Messages
  Profile: bob
    Memories
    Messages
```

A `recall()` on Alice's profile never returns memories from Bob's profile. Each profile is a self-contained memory system.
