# Agent Memory

Last updated Jun 2, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-memory/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Persistent, scoped memory for agents that need to remember users, organizations, and domain-specific context across conversations.

Note

Agent Memory is in private beta. To understand the memory model, refer to [How Agent Memory works](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-memory/concepts/how-agent-memory-works/).

Agent Memory gives agents durable memory across conversations without requiring you to build your own extraction, storage, search, and summarization pipeline. Ingest conversations to extract memories automatically, or explicitly remember information when your application already knows what to store.

Use Agent Memory to remember user preferences, company operating rules, support history, project state, or the state of a specific object.

**Agent Memory gives you:**

* Isolated profiles for users, agents, tenants, teams, or application entities
* Namespaces for separating applications, environments, or memory layers
* Automatic extraction of facts, events, instructions, and tasks from conversations
* APIs to add, list, recall, and delete memories
* Profile summaries for observing what Agent Memory remembers

## Features

[Scoped memory profiles](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-memory/concepts/namespaces-profiles/)

Store memories in isolated profiles for users, agents, teams, tenants, or application entities. Use namespaces to separate applications, environments, or memory layers.

Learn about profiles

[Automatic memory extraction](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-memory/api/workers-api/#ingest-conversations)

Ingest conversations to extract memories automatically, or explicitly add important information when your agent already knows what should be remembered.

Review the API

[Recall memories across agent executions](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-memory/api/workers-api/#recall-memories)

Retrieve relevant memory when an agent needs durable context that is not present in the current prompt, conversation, or execution.
