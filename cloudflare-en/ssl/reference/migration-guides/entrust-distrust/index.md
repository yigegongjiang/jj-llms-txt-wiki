# Entrust distrust by major browsers

Last updated Apr 17, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/reference/migration-guides/entrust-distrust/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Google Chrome and Mozilla have announced they will no longer trust certificates issued from Entrust's root CAs.

Since Entrust is not within the [certificate authorities](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/reference/certificate-authorities/) used by Cloudflare, this change may only affect customers who upload [custom certificates](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/edge-certificates/custom-certificates/) issued by Entrust.

## The decision

New Entrust certificates issued on **November 12, 2024 or after** will not be trusted on Chrome by default. And new Entrust certificates issued on **December 1, 2024 or after** will not be trusted on Mozilla by default.

Refer to the announcements ([Chrome ↗](https://security.googleblog.com/2024/06/sustaining-digital-certificate-security.html), [Mozilla ↗](https://groups.google.com/a/mozilla.org/g/dev-security-policy/c/jCvkhBjg9Yw?pli=1)) for a full list of roots that will be distrusted.

## Entrust's response

To prevent their customers from facing issues, Entrust has partnered with SSL.com, a different certificate authority, trusted by both Chrome and Mozilla.

This means that Entrust certificates will be issued using SSL.com roots.

## Cloudflare-managed certificates

Since Cloudflare also [partners with SSL.com](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/reference/certificate-authorities/), you can switch from uploading custom certificates to using Cloudflare-managed certificates. This change brings the following advantages:

* Use [Advanced certificates](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/edge-certificates/advanced-certificate-manager/) to have more control and flexibility while also benefitting from automatic renewals.
* Enable [Total TLS](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/edge-certificates/additional-options/total-tls/) to automatically issue certificates for your [proxied hostnames](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/proxy-status/).
* Use [Delegated DCV](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/edge-certificates/changing-dcv-method/methods/delegated-dcv/) to reduce manual intervention when renewing certificates for [partial (CNAME) setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/zone-setups/partial-setup/) zones.
* If you are a SaaS provider, extend the benefits of automatic renewals to your customers by specifying SSL.com as the certificate authority when [creating](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/custom%5Fhostnames/methods/create/) or [editing](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/custom%5Fhostnames/methods/edit/) your custom hostnames (API only).
