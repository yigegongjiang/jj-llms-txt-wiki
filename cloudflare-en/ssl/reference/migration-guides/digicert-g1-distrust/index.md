# DigiCert Legacy Root (G1) distrust by major browsers

Last updated Apr 17, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/reference/migration-guides/digicert-g1-distrust/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Browsers and operating systems are completing the removal of DigiCert's legacy G1 root certificates from their trust stores, effective **April 15, 2026**.

DigiCert announced this planned deprecation in 2023 and has been issuing certificates from their newer G2 roots since 2020.

Since DigiCert is not within the [certificate authorities](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/reference/certificate-authorities/) used by Cloudflare, this change may only affect customers who upload [custom certificates](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/edge-certificates/custom-certificates/) issued from DigiCert G1 roots.

## The change

The primary root being distrusted is **DigiCert Global Root CA**. The distrust also affects other legacy G1 intermediates cross-signed from this root.

DigiCert Global Root G2 and G3 remain fully trusted. Certificates that chain to G2 are unaffected.

Refer to [DigiCert's root and intermediate CA certificate updates ↗](https://knowledge.digicert.com/general-information/digicert-root-and-intermediate-ca-certificate-updates-2023) for the full list of affected roots.

## DigiCert's recommendation

DigiCert recommends reissuing any affected certificates from a G2 intermediate. This is a standard reissuance — you do not need to generate a new key in most cases.

## Cloudflare-managed certificates

Since Cloudflare does not use DigiCert roots, you can avoid this dependency entirely by switching to Cloudflare-managed certificates:

* Use [Advanced certificates](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/edge-certificates/advanced-certificate-manager/) for more control and flexibility with automatic renewals.
* Enable [Total TLS](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/edge-certificates/additional-options/total-tls/) to automatically issue certificates for your [proxied hostnames](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/proxy-status/).
* Use [Delegated DCV](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/edge-certificates/changing-dcv-method/methods/delegated-dcv/) to reduce manual intervention when renewing certificates for [partial (CNAME) setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/zone-setups/partial-setup/) zones.
