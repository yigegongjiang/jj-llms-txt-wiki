# ERR\_SSL\_PROTOCOL\_ERROR

Last updated Jun 11, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/troubleshooting/err-ssl-protocol-error/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

If visitors to your site experience SSL protocol errors such as:

* `ERR_SSL_PROTOCOL_ERROR` (Chrome)
* `Secure Connection Failed` or `PR_END_OF_FILE_ERROR` (Firefox)
* `Safari can't open the page because it couldn't establish a secure connection to the server` (Safari)

These errors indicate that the SSL/TLS handshake failed. This can happen for many reasons, including certificate issues, protocol incompatibilities, or network interference.

## Rule out common causes first

Before investigating protocol-specific issues, verify that the error is not caused by:

* **Certificate not yet active** \- If you recently added your domain, wait for your [Universal SSL certificate to activate](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/edge-certificates/universal-ssl/troubleshooting/).
* **Multi-level subdomain not covered** \- Universal SSL only covers one level of subdomains. Refer to [ERR\_SSL\_VERSION\_OR\_CIPHER\_MISMATCH](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/troubleshooting/version-cipher-mismatch/#multi-level-subdomains) for solutions.
* **Cipher suite mismatch** \- Older clients may not support modern cipher suites. Refer to [cipher suites](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/edge-certificates/additional-options/cipher-suites/) for configuration options.

## Test HTTP/3 (QUIC) compatibility

HTTP/3 uses the QUIC protocol over UDP, which some networks, firewalls, or devices do not fully support. If visitors experience intermittent SSL protocol errors, HTTP/3 may be the cause.

### When to suspect HTTP/3 issues

* Errors occur intermittently, not on every request
* The issue affects only some visitors (often those on corporate networks or certain ISPs)
* Visitors report the site works after refreshing multiple times
* The issue does not occur when using a VPN

### How to test

Temporarily disable HTTP/3 to determine if it is the cause:

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Protocol Optimization** page. [Go to **Settings** ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/:zone/speed/optimization)
2. Turn off **HTTP/3 (with QUIC)**.
3. Ask the affected visitor to test again.

If disabling HTTP/3 resolves the issue, the visitor's network likely blocks or mishandles UDP traffic on port 443\. **Re-enable HTTP/3 after testing** and work with the visitor to identify the specific network issue.

## Test TLS 1.3 compatibility

TLS 1.3 is the latest version of the TLS protocol and provides improved security and performance. However, some network security devices that perform SSL/TLS inspection may not fully support TLS 1.3.

### When to suspect TLS 1.3 issues

* Visitors using corporate networks with SSL inspection report connection issues
* Antivirus software with HTTPS scanning is installed on the visitor's device
* The error occurs consistently for specific visitors but not others

### How to test

Caution

Disabling TLS 1.3 reduces security for all visitors. Only disable it temporarily for diagnostic purposes.

Temporarily disable TLS 1.3 to determine if it is the cause:

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Edge Certificates** page. [Go to **Edge Certificates** ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/:zone/ssl-tls/edge-certificates)
2. Find **TLS 1.3** and turn it off.
3. Ask the affected visitor to test again.

If disabling TLS 1.3 resolves the issue, the visitor's network has a middlebox (firewall, proxy, or antivirus) that does not support TLS 1.3\. **Re-enable TLS 1.3 after testing** and ask the visitor to:

* Update their security software to a version that supports TLS 1.3
* Contact their IT department to update network security devices
* Temporarily disable HTTPS scanning in their antivirus software

If you cannot identify the root cause, [contact Cloudflare Support](https://developers.cloudflare.com/support/contacting-cloudflare-support/) with packet captures from the affected visitor showing the failed TLS handshake.

## ISP and network interference

Some Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and corporate networks deploy security features that can interfere with HTTPS connections:

* **Deep packet inspection (DPI)** \- Inspects encrypted traffic and may interfere with connections it cannot analyze
* **SSL/TLS interception proxies** \- Intercept and re-encrypt traffic, which can fail with newer protocols
* **Parental controls or content filters** \- May block or interfere with connections to certain sites
* **Carrier-grade NAT (CGNAT)** \- Can cause connection issues, especially with UDP-based protocols like QUIC

### How to identify network interference

Ask the affected visitor to:

1. **Try a different network** \- Use mobile data instead of Wi-Fi, or try a different ISP
2. **Use a VPN** \- If the site works through a VPN, the ISP or local network is likely interfering
3. **Disable local security software** \- Temporarily disable antivirus or firewall software to test
4. **Check with their ISP** \- Some ISPs have security features that can be disabled upon request

### If network interference is confirmed

If the issue is caused by the visitor's ISP or network:

* The visitor may need to contact their ISP to add the domain to an allowlist or disable specific security features
* For corporate networks, the IT department may need to update firewall or proxy rules
* As a site owner, you have limited options since the interference occurs outside of Cloudflare

## Collect diagnostic information

If the above steps do not resolve the issue, collect the following information from affected visitors:

1. **Cloudflare diagnostic data** \- Ask the visitor to access `https://your-domain.com/cdn-cgi/trace` and share the output
2. **Exact error message** \- The full error text and error code from the browser
3. **Browser and OS version** \- Including any security software installed
4. **Network information** \- Whether they are on a corporate network, using a VPN, or have any proxy configured

Check [Cloudflare Status ↗](https://www.cloudflarestatus.com/) to verify there are no ongoing incidents affecting SSL/TLS.

If the issue persists and affects many visitors, [contact Cloudflare Support](https://developers.cloudflare.com/support/contacting-cloudflare-support/) with the diagnostic information collected.
