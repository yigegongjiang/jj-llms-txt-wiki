# Methods

Last updated Apr 16, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/edge-certificates/changing-dcv-method/methods/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Before a certificate authority (CA) will issue a certificate for a domain, the requester must prove they have control over that domain. This process is known as domain control validation (DCV).

## Perform DCV

For details on each method available for DCV, refer to the following resources:

* [Delegated](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/edge-certificates/changing-dcv-method/methods/delegated-dcv/)
* [TXT](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/edge-certificates/changing-dcv-method/methods/txt/)
* [HTTP](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/edge-certificates/changing-dcv-method/methods/http/)

Note

For guidance on when you need to perform DCV, refer to [Domain Control Validation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/edge-certificates/changing-dcv-method/).

## Verify DCV status

To verify the [DCV status](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/reference/certificate-statuses/) of a certificate, either monitor the certificate's status on the [**Edge Certificates** ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/:zone/ssl-tls/edge-certificates) page or use the [Verification Status endpoint](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/ssl/subresources/verification/methods/get/).

A status of `active` means that the certificate has been deployed to Cloudflare’s global network and will be served as soon as HTTP traffic is proxied to Cloudflare.

## Update DCV methods

You cannot update the DCV method for an active certificate. To update the DCV method for a subdomain, wait until the DCV expires and then change the DCV method.
