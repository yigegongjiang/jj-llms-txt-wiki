# Remove key file password

Last updated Apr 16, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/edge-certificates/custom-certificates/remove-file-key-password/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

You cannot upload a custom certificate with a password-protected key file.

The process for removing the password depends on your operating system. The following examples remove the password from `example.com.key`.

Linux

1. Open a command console.
2. Go to the directory containing the `example.com.key` file.
3. Copy the original key.  
```sh  
cp example.com.key temp.key  
```
4. Run the following command (if using an ECDSA certificate, replace `rsa` with `ec`).  
```sh  
openssl rsa -in temp.key -out example.com.key  
```
5. When prompted in the console window, enter the original key password.
6. [Upload the file contents](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/edge-certificates/custom-certificates/uploading/#upload-a-custom-certificate) to Cloudflare.

Windows

1. Go to [https://indy.fulgan.com/SSL/ ↗](https://indy.fulgan.com/SSL/) and download the latest version of OpenSSL for your x86 or x86\_64 operating system.
2. Open the `.zip` file and extract it.
3. Select **openssl.exe**.
4. In the command window that appears, run:  
```sh  
rsa -in C:\Path\To\example.com.key -out key.pem  
```
5. Enter the original key password when prompted by the **openssl.exe** command window.
6. [Upload](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/edge-certificates/custom-certificates/uploading/#upload-a-custom-certificate) the contents of the `key.pem` file to Cloudflare.
