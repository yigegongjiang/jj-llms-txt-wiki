# Manage advanced certificates

Last updated Apr 16, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/edge-certificates/advanced-certificate-manager/manage-certificates/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

## Create a certificate

If you are using an existing [Universal SSL certificate](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/edge-certificates/universal-ssl/), Cloudflare will automatically replace this certificate once you finish ordering your advanced certificate.

Once you order a certificate, you can review the [certificate's status](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/reference/certificate-statuses/) on the [**Edge Certificates** ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/:zone/ssl-tls/edge-certificates) page or via the API with a [GET request](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/ssl/subresources/certificate%5Fpacks/methods/list/).

To create a new advanced certificate in the dashboard:

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Edge Certificates** page.  
[Go to **Edge Certificates** ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/:zone/ssl-tls/edge-certificates)
2. Select **Order Advanced Certificate**.
3. If Cloudflare does not have your billing information, you will need to enter that information.
4. Enter the following information:

  * Certificate authority
  * Certificate hostnames  
    * For hostnames longer than 64 characters, use the API.
  * Validation method
  * Certificate validity period
5. Select **Save**.

To create a new certificate using the API, send a [POST request](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/ssl/subresources/certificate%5Fpacks/methods/create/) to the Cloudflare API.

If you need certificates for hostnames longer than 64 characters ([RFC 5280 ↗](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5280.html)), set the `cloudflare_branding` option to `true`. This will add `sni.cloudflaressl.com` in the Common Name (CN) field and will include the long hostname as a part of the Subject Alternative Name (SAN).

Caution

The available options for **Validation method** and **Certificate Validity Period** may vary depending on the certificate authority you choose and the hostnames that you include in your Advanced certificate order.

## Delete a certificate

To delete an advanced certificate in the dashboard:

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Edge Certificates** page.  
[Go to **Edge Certificates** ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/:zone/ssl-tls/edge-certificates)
2. Select a certificate.
3. Select **Delete Certificate**.

To delete a certificate using the API, send a [DELETE request](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/ssl/subresources/certificate%5Fpacks/methods/delete/) to the Cloudflare API.

---

## Restart validation

To restart validation for a certificate in a `validation_timed_out` status, send a [PATCH request](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/ssl/subresources/certificate%5Fpacks/methods/edit/) to the API.

---

## Restrict cipher suites

Cipher suites are a combination of ciphers used to negotiate security settings during the [SSL/TLS handshake ↗](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/what-happens-in-a-tls-handshake/) (and therefore separate from the [SSL/TLS protocol](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/reference/protocols/)).

For more details, refer to [Customize cipher suites](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/edge-certificates/additional-options/cipher-suites/customize-cipher-suites/).

---

## Perform domain control validation (DCV)

Before a certificate authority (CA) will issue a certificate for a domain, the requester must prove they have control over that domain. This process is known as domain control validation (DCV).

  
Normally, you only need to update DCV if you have your application on a partial setup (Cloudflare does not run your authoritative nameservers).

For more information about DCV, refer to [DCV methods](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/edge-certificates/changing-dcv-method/).

---

## Set up alerts

You can configure alerts to receive notifications for changes in your certificates.

Advanced Certificate Alert

**Who is it for?**

Customers with [advanced certificates](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/edge-certificates/advanced-certificate-manager/) that want to be alerted on validation, issuance, renewal, and expiration of certificates.

**Other options / filters**

None.

**Included with**

When an advanced certificate is validated, issued, renewed, or expired.

**What should you do if you receive one?**

Action only needed if notification is about a certificate that failed to be issued. Refer to [SSL expired or SSL mismatch errors](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/troubleshooting/version-cipher-mismatch/) for more information.

Refer to [Cloudflare Notifications](https://developers.cloudflare.com/notifications/get-started/) for more information on how to set up an alert.

---

## Advanced certificate renewal

The certificate validity period you choose determines when the auto renewal will start for your certificate. For details, refer to [Validity period and renewal](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/reference/certificate-validity-periods/).
