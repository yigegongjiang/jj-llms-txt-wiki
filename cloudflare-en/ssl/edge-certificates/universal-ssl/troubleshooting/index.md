## Resolve a timed out state

If a certificate issuance times out, Cloudflare tells you where in the chain of issuance the timeout occurred: Initializing, Validation, Issuance, Deployment, or Deletion.

To resolve timeout issues, try one or more of the following options:

* Change the **Proxy status** of related DNS records to **DNS only** (gray-clouded) and wait at least a minute. Then, change the **Proxy status** back to **Proxied** (orange-clouded).
* [Disable Universal SSL](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/edge-certificates/universal-ssl/disable-universal-ssl/) and wait at least a minute. Then, re-enable Universal SSL.
* Send a PATCH request to the [validation endpoint](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/ssl/subresources/verification/methods/edit/) using the same [DCV method](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/edge-certificates/changing-dcv-method/) (API only). Make sure that the `--data` field is not empty in your request.
* Review your domain control validation (DCV). Changing the DCV method will restart certificate issuance.

## Delete certificates

You can [use the API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/ssl/subresources/certificate%5Fpacks/methods/delete/) to delete certificates that you no longer want listed on the Cloudflare dashboard.
