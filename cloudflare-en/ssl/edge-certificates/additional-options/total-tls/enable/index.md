# Enable

Last updated Apr 16, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/edge-certificates/additional-options/total-tls/enable/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

To enable [Total TLS](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/edge-certificates/additional-options/total-tls/) \- which issues individual certificates for your proxied hostnames - follow these instructions:

To enable Total TLS in the dashboard:

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Edge Certificates** page.  
[Go to **Edge Certificates** ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/:zone/ssl-tls/edge-certificates)
2. For **Total TLS**, switch the toggle to **On** and - if desired - choose an issuing **Certificate Authority**.

To enable Total TLS with the API, send a [PATCH](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/acm/subresources/total%5Ftls/methods/create/) request with the `enabled` parameter set to your desired setting (`true` or `false`).

You can also specify a desired certificate authority by adding a value to the `certificate_authority` parameter.

## Aspects to consider

* Total TLS certificates follow the Common Name (CN) restriction of 64 characters ([RFC 5280 ↗](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5280.html)). If you have a hostname that exceeds this length, you can create an [Advanced Certificate](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/edge-certificates/advanced-certificate-manager/manage-certificates/#create-a-certificate) via API to cover it.
