# Compliance standards

Last updated Jun 8, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/edge-certificates/additional-options/cipher-suites/compliance-status/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Consider the following recommendations on custom [cipher suites](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/edge-certificates/additional-options/cipher-suites/) for when your organization needs to comply with regulatory standards.

Refer to [Customize cipher suites](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/edge-certificates/additional-options/cipher-suites/customize-cipher-suites/) to learn how to specify cipher suites at zone level or per hostname.

Caution

Also [enable TLS 1.3](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/edge-certificates/additional-options/tls-13/#enable-tls-13) on your zone and, when opting for [PCI DSS](#pci-dss), make sure to up your [Minimum TLS version](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/edge-certificates/additional-options/minimum-tls/) to `1.2`. Refer to [Cipher suites](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/edge-certificates/additional-options/cipher-suites/) and [TLS protocols](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/reference/protocols/) to learn more.

## PCI DSS

Recommended cipher suites for compliance with the [Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) ↗](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/standards/pci-dss/). Enhances payment card data security.

Cipher suites list

`AEAD-AES128-GCM-SHA256`[1](#user-content-fn-1), `AEAD-AES256-GCM-SHA384`[2](#user-content-fn-2), `AEAD-CHACHA20-POLY1305-SHA256`[3](#user-content-fn-3), `ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256`, `ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256`, `ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384`, `ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384`, `ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305`, `ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305`

If you are customizing cipher suites via API, refer to [Steps and API examples](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/edge-certificates/additional-options/cipher-suites/customize-cipher-suites/api/#steps-and-api-examples) for a snippet you can copy with the formatted array.

## FIPS-140-3

Recommended cipher suites for compliance with the [Federal Information Processing Standard (140-3) ↗](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/140-3/final). Used to approve cryptographic modules.

Cipher suites list

`AES128-GCM-SHA256`, `AES128-SHA`, `AES128-SHA256`, `AES256-SHA`, `AES256-SHA256`, `DES-CBC3-SHA`, `ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256`, `ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-SHA`, `ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-SHA256`, `ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384`, `ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-SHA384`, `ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256`, `ECDHE-RSA-AES128-SHA`, `ECDHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256`, `ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384`, `ECDHE-RSA-AES256-SHA`, `ECDHE-RSA-AES256-SHA384`

If you are customizing cipher suites via API, refer to [Steps and API examples](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/edge-certificates/additional-options/cipher-suites/customize-cipher-suites/api/#steps-and-api-examples) for a snippet you can copy with the formatted array.
