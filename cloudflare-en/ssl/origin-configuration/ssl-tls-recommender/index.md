# SSL/TLS Recommender

Last updated Aug 14, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/origin-configuration/ssl-tls-recommender/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

The SSL/TLS Recommender helps you choose which [Encryption mode](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/origin-configuration/ssl-modes/) is best for your application.

Caution

Cloudflare is deprecating our SSL/TLS Recommender in favor of [Automatic SSL/TLS](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/origin-configuration/ssl-modes/#automatic-ssltls-default).

## Common tasks

### Enable SSL/TLS recommendations

To make sure you do not inadvertently block the **SSL/TLS Recommender**, review your settings to make sure your domain:

* Is accessible.
* Is not blocking requests from our bot (which uses a user agent of `Cloudflare-SSLDetector`).
* Does not have any active, SSL-specific [Page Rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/page-rules/) or [Configuration rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/configuration-rules/).

Then, you can enable the SSL/TLS recommender.

To enable SSL/TLS recommendations in the dashboard:

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **SSL/TLS Overview** page.  
[Go to **Overview** ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/:zone/ssl-tls)
2. For **SSL/TLS Recommender**, switch the toggle to **On**.

To adjust your SSL/TLS Recommender enrollment with the API, send a [PATCH](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/ssl/subresources/recommendations/methods/get/) request with the `enabled` parameter set to your desired setting (`true` or `false`).

### Manually trigger a new scan

Once you enable it, the recommender runs future scans periodically — typically every two days — and sends notifications if new recommendations become available.

To manually re-trigger a new scan, disable and then [re-enable SSL/TLS recommendations](#enable-ssltls-recommendations).

## How it works

Once enabled, the SSL/TLS Recommender runs an origin scan using the user agent `Cloudflare-SSLDetector` and ignores your `robots.txt` file (except for rules explicitly targeting the user agent).

Based on this initial scan, the Recommender may decide that you could use a stronger [SSL encryption mode](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/origin-configuration/ssl-modes/). It will never recommend a weaker option than what is currently configured.

If so, it will send the application owner an email with the recommended option and add a _Recommended by Cloudflare_ tag to that option on the **SSL/TLS** page. You are not required to use this recommendation.

If you do not receive an email, keep your current **SSL encryption mode**.
