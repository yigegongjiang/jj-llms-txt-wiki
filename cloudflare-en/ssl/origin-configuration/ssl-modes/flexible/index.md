# Flexible

Last updated Jul 9, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/origin-configuration/ssl-modes/flexible/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Setting your encryption mode to **Flexible** makes your site partially secure. Cloudflare allows HTTPS connections between your visitor and Cloudflare, but all connections between Cloudflare and your origin are made through HTTP. As a result, an SSL certificate is not required on your origin.

    accDescr: With an encryption mode of Flexible, your application encrypts traffic between the visitor and Cloudflare, but not between Cloudflare and your server.

## Use when

Choose this option when you cannot set up an SSL certificate on your origin or your origin does not support SSL/TLS.

## Required setup

### Prerequisites

Depending on your origin configuration, you may have to adjust settings to avoid [Mixed Content errors](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/troubleshooting/mixed-content-errors/) or [redirect loops](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/troubleshooting/too-many-redirects/).

### Process

To change your encryption mode in the dashboard:

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **SSL/TLS Overview** page.  
[Go to **Overview** ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/:zone/ssl-tls)
2. Choose an encryption mode.

To adjust your encryption mode with the API, send a [PATCH](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/zones/subresources/settings/methods/edit/) request with `ssl` as the setting name in the URI path, and the `value` parameter set to your desired setting (`off`, `flexible`, `full`, `strict`, or `origin_pull`).

## Limitations

Flexible mode is only supported for HTTPS connections on port 443 (default port). Other ports using HTTPS will fall back to [**Full** mode](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/origin-configuration/ssl-modes/full/).

If your application contains sensitive information (personalized data, user login), use [**Full**](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/origin-configuration/ssl-modes/full/) or [**Full (Strict)**](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/origin-configuration/ssl-modes/full-strict/) modes instead.

[Authenticated Origin Pull](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/origin-configuration/authenticated-origin-pull/) does not work when your [**SSL/TLS encryption mode**](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/origin-configuration/ssl-modes/) is set to **Off** or **Flexible**.
