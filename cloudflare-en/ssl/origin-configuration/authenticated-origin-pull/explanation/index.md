# About

## Simple explanation

When visitors request content from your domain, Cloudflare first attempts to serve content from the cache. If this attempt fails, Cloudflare sends a request — or an `origin pull` — back to your origin web server to get the content.

Authenticated Origin Pulls makes sure that all of these `origin pulls` come from Cloudflare. Put another way, Authenticated Origin Pulls ensures that any HTTPS requests outside of Cloudflare will not receive a response from your origin.

This block also applies for requests to [unproxied DNS records](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/proxy-status/#dns-only-records) in Cloudflare.

Caution

The Cloudflare-provided certificate used by [global AOP](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/origin-configuration/authenticated-origin-pull/set-up/global/) is not exclusive to your account. It only guarantees that a request is coming from the Cloudflare network.

For stricter security, set up [zone-level](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/origin-configuration/authenticated-origin-pull/set-up/zone-level/) or [per-hostname](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/origin-configuration/authenticated-origin-pull/set-up/per-hostname/) AOP with your own certificate and consider [other security measures for your origin](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/security/protect-your-origin-server/).

## Detailed explanation

Cloudflare enforces authenticated origin pulls by adding an extra layer of TLS client certificate authentication when establishing a connection between Cloudflare and the origin web server.

### Types of handshakes

For more details, refer to [What is a TLS handshake? ↗](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/what-happens-in-a-tls-handshake/).

**Standard TLS handshake**

**Client authenticated TLS handshake**

### Comparison diagrams

Without Authenticated Origin Pulls, Cloudflare performs standard TLS handshakes between a client device and Cloudflare and Cloudflare and your origin. This is true even if you have [**Full**](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/origin-configuration/ssl-modes/full/) or [**Full (strict)**](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/origin-configuration/ssl-modes/full-strict/) encryption modes enabled.

      D[External device] --Standard TLS Handshake ----> C

  
This lack of authentication means that - even if your origin is [protected behind Cloudflare](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/concepts/how-cloudflare-works/) \- attackers with your origin's IP address will still receive a response from your origin for HTTPS requests.

With Authenticated Origin Pulls, Cloudflare performs standard TLS handshakes between a client device and Cloudflare, but a client-authenticated TLS handshake between Cloudflare and your origin.

This additional layer of authentication ensures that any HTTPS requests outside of Cloudflare will not receive a response from your origin.
