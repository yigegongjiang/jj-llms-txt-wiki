## Extra fields

Most resource types only require `resource_type` and `resource_id`. Two resource types require an additional field in both request bodies and query parameters.

### `worker_version`

Include the `worker_id` field:

```bash
# GET
curl -X GET "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/$ACCOUNT_ID/tags?resource_type=worker_version&resource_id=$VERSION_ID&worker_id=$WORKER_ID" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN"

# PUT
curl -X PUT "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/$ACCOUNT_ID/tags" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "resource_type": "worker_version",
    "resource_id": "'"$VERSION_ID"'",
    "worker_id": "'"$WORKER_ID"'",
    "tags": {
      "version": "1.2.3",
      "environment": "staging"
    }
  }'
```

### `access_application_policy`

Include the `access_application_id` field:

```bash
# GET
curl -X GET "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/$ZONE_ID/tags?resource_type=access_application_policy&resource_id=$POLICY_ID&access_application_id=$APP_ID" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN"

# PUT
curl -X PUT "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/$ZONE_ID/tags" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "resource_type": "access_application_policy",
    "resource_id": "'"$POLICY_ID"'",
    "access_application_id": "'"$APP_ID"'",
    "tags": {
      "sensitivity": "high",
      "team": "security"
    }
  }'
```
