# Pricing

Last updated Aug 7, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2-data-catalog/platform/pricing/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

R2 Data Catalog charges based on two dimensions in addition to standard [R2 storage and operations](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/pricing/):

1. **Catalog operations**: Metadata operations such as creating tables, reading table metadata, and updating table properties.
2. **Compaction data processed**: The volume of data processed and objects compacted when [automatic table compaction](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2-data-catalog/table-maintenance/) is turned on.

All included usage is on a monthly basis.

### Catalog operations

Catalog operations are metadata requests made to the Iceberg REST catalog, such as creating a table, retrieving table metadata, updating table properties, and listing tables in a namespace. These operations do not scan or move data.

### Compaction

When you turn on [automatic compaction](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2-data-catalog/table-maintenance/), R2 Data Catalog periodically rewrites small data files into larger, optimized files. This improves query performance and reduces the number of files in your table. Compaction is billed on two sub-dimensions:

* **Data processed**: The total bytes read and rewritten during compaction.
* **Objects processed**: The number of data files compacted.

Compaction charges only apply when compaction is turned on for a table. If you have not turned on compaction, you will not incur any compaction charges.

Note

Current compaction pricing is based on binpacking, the simplest form of compaction. More compute-intensive compaction algorithms (such as sort or z-order) may be priced differently in the future.

### Snapshot Expiration

When you turn on [automatic snapshot expiration](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2-data-catalog/table-maintenance/#why-do-i-need-snapshot-expiration), R2 Data Catalog automatically deletes old snapshots and their associated data files after a specified retention period. Snapshot expiration is free of charge and does not incur any additional costs outside of the standard R2 storage and data catalog operations charges.

## Billing examples

### Example 1: Low-volume analytics table

A user maintains a single Iceberg table with 50 GB of data. They make 500,000 catalog operations per month and have compaction turned on, which processes 20 GB across 200,000 files.

| Dimension                   | Usage   | Included  | Billable | Cost      |
| --------------------------- | ------- | --------- | -------- | --------- |
| Catalog operations          | 500,000 | 1,000,000 | 0        | $0.00     |
| Compaction (data processed) | 20 GB   | 10 GB     | 10 GB    | $0.05     |
| Compaction (objects)        | 200,000 | 1,000,000 | 0        | $0.00     |
| **Total (Data Catalog)**    |         |           |          | **$0.05** |

Standard R2 storage charges ($0.015 / GB-month) apply separately for the 50 GB of data stored.

### Example 2: Streaming ingest at 20 MB/s

A user streams data into an Iceberg table at 20 MB/s using [Pipelines](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pipelines/). Over a month (\~30 days) this produces approximately 50,625 GB (\~49 TB) of data, 347,000 catalog operations, and compaction processes roughly 50,625 GB across 43,200 files.

| Dimension                   | Usage           | Included    | Billable        | Cost          |
| --------------------------- | --------------- | ----------- | --------------- | ------------- |
| R2 storage                  | 50,625 GB-month | 10 GB-month | 50,615 GB-month | $759.23       |
| Catalog operations          | 347,000         | 1,000,000   | 0               | $0.00         |
| Compaction (data processed) | 50,625 GB       | 10 GB       | 50,615 GB       | $253.08       |
| Compaction (objects)        | 43,200          | 1,000,000   | 0               | $0.00         |
| **Total**                   |                 |             |                 | **$1,012.31** |

For large-scale use cases, storage costs are typically the largest component of the bill.
