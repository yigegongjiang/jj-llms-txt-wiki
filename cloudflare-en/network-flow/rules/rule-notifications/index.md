# Configure rule notifications

Last updated Apr 17, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/network-flow/rules/rule-notifications/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Network Flow (formerly Magic Network Monitoring) can notify you by email, webhook, or PagerDuty when a rule is triggered. When a rule detects a traffic anomaly, notifications alert your team so you can respond — or, if you use Magic Transit with auto-advertisement, Cloudflare can begin mitigating the attack automatically.

For more information on the notification platform, refer to [Notifications documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/notifications/). You can also:

* [Configure Cloudflare notifications](https://developers.cloudflare.com/notifications/get-started/)
* [Configure PagerDuty](https://developers.cloudflare.com/notifications/get-started/configure-pagerduty/)
* [Configure webhooks](https://developers.cloudflare.com/notifications/get-started/configure-webhooks/)
* [Test a notification](https://developers.cloudflare.com/notifications/get-started/#test-a-notification)
* [Notification History](https://developers.cloudflare.com/notifications/notification-history/)

## Notification configuration fields

| Field                      | Description                                                       |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Notification name**      | A label to identify this notification in your notifications list. |
| **Description (optional)** | The description of the notification.                              |
| **Webhooks**               | One or more webhooks to deliver the notification to.              |
| **Notification email**     | One or more email addresses to deliver the notification to.       |

## Rule Auto-Advertisement notifications

Webhook, PagerDuty, and email notifications are sent following an auto-advertisement attempt for all prefixes inside the flagged rule.

You will receive the status of the advertisement for each prefix with the following available statuses:

* **Advertised**: The prefix was successfully advertised.
* **Already Advertised**: The prefix was advertised prior to the auto advertisement attempt.
* **Delayed**: The prefix cannot currently be advertised but will attempt advertisement. After the prefix can be advertised, a new notification is sent with the updated status.
* **Locked**: The prefix is locked and cannot be advertised.
* **Could not Advertise**: Cloudflare was unable to advertise the prefix. This status can occur for multiple reasons, but usually occurs when you are not allowed to advertise a prefix.
* **Error**: A general error occurred during prefix advertisement.

## Configure rule notifications

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Notifications** page.
