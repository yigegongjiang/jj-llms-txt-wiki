# WAF phases

Last updated Aug 3, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/reference/phases/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

The Web Application Firewall provides the following [phases](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/about/phases/) where you can create rulesets and rules:

* `http_request_firewall_custom`
* `http_ratelimit`
* `http_request_firewall_managed`

These phases exist both at the account level and at the zone level. Considering the available phases and the two different levels, rules will be evaluated in the following order:

| Security feature                                                                                | Scope   | Phase                            | Ruleset kind                 | Location in the dashboard                                                                                               |
