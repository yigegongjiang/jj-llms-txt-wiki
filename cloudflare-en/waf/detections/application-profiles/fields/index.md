# Fields

Last updated Sep 24, 2026|Copy as Markdown| [View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/detections/application-profiles/fields/index.md)| [Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Schema Profile detections populate these fields after an applicable profile becomes available:

| Field | Type | Source | Meaning | Available in |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `cf.schema_validation.learned.violated` | `Boolean` | Learned Schema Profile | `true` when an evaluated request violates the learned profile. | Security Analytics and Custom Rules |
| `cf.schema_validation.uploaded.violated` | `Boolean` | Uploaded schema | `true` when an evaluated request violates the supplied schema. | Security Analytics and Custom Rules |

## Violated parameters

The following fields identify the names of Schema Profile violations by request location.

| Field | Type | Source | Meaning | Available in |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `cf.schema_validation.learned.path.violated_parameters` | `Array<String>` | Learned Schema Profile | Names of violating path parameters. | Custom Rules |
| `cf.schema_validation.learned.query.violated_parameters` | `Array<String>` | Learned Schema Profile | Names of violating query parameters. | Custom Rules |
| `cf.schema_validation.learned.headers.violated_parameters` | `Array<String>` | Learned Schema Profile | Names of violating request headers. | Custom Rules |
| `cf.schema_validation.learned.cookies.violated_parameters` | `Array<String>` | Learned Schema Profile | Names of violating cookies. | Custom Rules |
| `cf.schema_validation.learned.body.violated_parameters` | `Array<String>` | Learned Schema Profile | JSON path of a request body violation. | Custom Rules |
| `cf.schema_validation.uploaded.path.violated_parameters` | `Array<String>` | Uploaded schema | Names of violating path parameters. | Custom Rules |
| `cf.schema_validation.uploaded.query.violated_parameters` | `Array<String>` | Uploaded schema | Names of violating query parameters. | Custom Rules |
| `cf.schema_validation.uploaded.headers.violated_parameters` | `Array<String>` | Uploaded schema | Names of violating request headers. | Custom Rules |
| `cf.schema_validation.uploaded.cookies.violated_parameters` | `Array<String>` | Uploaded schema | Names of violating cookies. | Custom Rules |
| `cf.schema_validation.uploaded.body.violated_parameters` | `Array<String>` | Uploaded schema | JSON path of a request body violation. | Custom Rules |

For body violations, the array contains the first detected violation's JSON path. A value of `$` identifies the body without a more specific path.

## Undeclared query parameters

These fields contain URL-decoded query parameter names presented in a request but not declared in the schema.

| Field | Type | Source | Meaning | Available in |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `cf.schema_validation.learned.query.undeclared_parameters` | `Array<String>` | Learned Schema Profile | Names of query parameters present in the request but not declared in the schema. | Custom Rules |
| `cf.schema_validation.uploaded.query.undeclared_parameters` | `Array<String>` | Uploaded schema | Names of query parameters present in the request but not declared in the schema. | Custom Rules |

## Violation details

Sampled violations in Profile Analysis contain four structured fields that report the first detected violation for the request:

| Field | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `location` | `String` | Request component containing the violation: `path`, `query`, `header`, `cookie`, or `body`. |
| `error_class` | `String` | Stable, broad category for grouping similar violations. |
| `error_detail` | `String` | Optional specific reason within the error class. |
| `target` | `String` | Optional parameter, header, cookie, or `$`-prefixed JSON body path associated with the violation. |

### Error classes

The `error_class` field can have the following values:

| Value | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `missing_required` | A required parameter, body, or header was absent. |
| `invalid_type` | A value had the wrong OpenAPI or JSON type. |
| `invalid_encoding` | Bytes or text did not use the expected encoding. |
| `invalid_syntax` | Request syntax was invalid, such as malformed JSON. |
| `invalid_media_type` | A media type did not match the schema. |
| `unsupported_media_type` | A media type or media type parameter is unsupported. |
| `duplicate_value` | A value that accepts one entry appeared more than once. |
| `too_many_values` | A collection contained more values than the validator accepts. |
| `constraint_violation` | A value violated an OpenAPI or JSON Schema constraint. |
| `body_size` | The request body could not be validated because of its size or truncation. |

### Error details

The `error_detail` field adds context when the error class alone is insufficient. The field is empty when the class, location, and target identify the failure.

| Detail family | Possible values |
| --- | --- |
| Expected type | <code>expected:array</code>, <code>expected:boolean</code>, <code>expected:integer</code>, <code>expected:null</code>, <code>expected:number</code>, <code>expected:object</code>, <code>expected:string</code>, <code>expected:one_of</code> |
| Encoding and syntax | <code>invalid_utf8</code>, <code>invalid_ascii</code>, <code>invalid_json</code>, <code>invalid_form_urlencoded</code> |
| Media type | <code>invalid_content_type</code>, <code>invalid_media_type</code>, <code>unsupported_media_type_parameter</code> |
| Schema constraint | <code>invalid_length</code>, <code>invalid_object_property_count</code>, <code>invalid_array_item_count</code>, <code>not</code>, <code>all_of</code>, <code>any_of</code>, <code>one_of</code>, <code>invalid_enum_variant</code>, <code>forbidden_value</code>, <code>missing_required_property</code>, <code>number_too_small</code>, <code>number_too_big</code>, <code>number_not_in_range</code>, <code>string_length_not_in_range</code>, <code>different_const_value</code>, <code>multiple_of</code>, <code>pattern_no_match</code>, <code>value_too_deep</code> |
| Format constraint | <code>format_violation:&lt;format&gt;</code>, where <code>&lt;format&gt;</code> identifies the OpenAPI format. Current formats include <code>uuid</code>, <code>email</code>, <code>date-time</code>, <code>date</code>, <code>time</code>, <code>hostname</code>, <code>ipv4</code>, <code>ipv6</code>, <code>uri</code>, <code>uri-reference</code>, <code>iri</code>, <code>iri-reference</code>, <code>int32</code>, <code>int64</code>, <code>uint64</code>, <code>byte</code>, <code>float</code>, and <code>double</code>. |

### Targets

The `target` value depends on the violation location:

| Location | Target |
| --- | --- |
| `path`, `query`, or `cookie` | Parameter name |
| `header` | Header name, such as `content-type` |
| `body` | `$`-prefixed JSON path, such as `$.items[0].quantity` |

The target is empty for failures that apply to the entire request body. It can also be empty when Cloudflare cannot safely report a target.

## Availability

Customers with API Security already have access to Schema Profiles through Schema Learning and Schema Validation. Cloudflare is opening a closed beta to invited Enterprise customers without API Security. Interested customers can contact their account team to express interest. Closed-beta access does not imply future plan availability or pricing.

## Evaluation

Cloudflare evaluates requests after the corresponding profile becomes available. The profile must apply to the request operation.

Requests without an applicable profile have **Not evaluated** status.

For request statuses and investigation steps, refer to [Analyze profile detections](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/detections/application-profiles/analyze-profile-detections/).
