# Traffic detections

Last updated Apr 16, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/detections/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Traffic detections check incoming requests for malicious or potentially malicious activity. Each enabled detection scores or classifies requests by populating one or more fields. These fields appear as filters in the [Security Analytics](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/analytics/security-analytics/) dashboard, and you can use them in rule expressions.

Detections are always on once enabled, even if you have not configured any security rules that use them. You can review detection results in [Security Analytics](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/analytics/security-analytics/) to identify traffic patterns and spot potentially malicious traffic. For example, you can analyze traffic based on [attack score](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/detections/attack-score/), [bot score](https://developers.cloudflare.com/bots/concepts/bot-score/), [content scan results](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/detections/malicious-uploads/), or the [presence of personally identifiable information (PII)](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/detections/ai-security-for-apps/) in large language model (LLM) prompts.

Cloudflare provides the following detections:

* [WAF attack score](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/detections/attack-score/)
* [Leaked credentials detection](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/detections/leaked-credentials/)
* [Malicious uploads detection](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/detections/malicious-uploads/)
* [AI Security for Apps](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/detections/ai-security-for-apps/)
* [Bot score](https://developers.cloudflare.com/bots/concepts/bot-score/)
* [Threat intelligence](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/detections/threat-intelligence/)

## Turn on a detection

To turn on a traffic detection:

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the Security **Settings** page.  
[Go to **Settings** ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/:zone/security/settings)
2. Filter by **Detection tools**.
3. Turn on the desired detections.

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/), and select your account and domain.
2. Go to **Security** \> **Settings**.
3. Under **Incoming traffic detections**, turn on the desired detections.

Enabled detections will run for all incoming traffic.

Notes

* On Free plans, the leaked credentials detection is enabled by default, and no action is required.
* Currently, you cannot manage the [bot score](https://developers.cloudflare.com/bots/concepts/bot-score/) and [attack score](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/detections/attack-score/) detections from the **Settings** page. Refer to the documentation of each feature for availability details.
