# Threat intelligence

Last updated Jun 15, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/detections/threat-intelligence/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

The threat intelligence detection matches incoming requests against indicators in the [Cloudforce One](https://developers.cloudflare.com/security-center/cloudforce-one/) threat intelligence database. The detection matches on client IP address. If the IP was involved in threat activity in the past seven days, Cloudflare populates [threat intelligence fields](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/detections/threat-intelligence/fields/) you can use in WAF rule expressions.

You can use these fields in [custom rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/custom-rules/) and [rate limiting rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/rate-limiting-rules/) to match on:

* Known threat actor names (`cf.intel.ip.attacker_names`)
* Industries the IP address has targeted (`cf.intel.ip.target_industries`)
* Source and target countries of threat activity (`cf.intel.ip.attacker_countries`, `cf.intel.ip.target_countries`)
* The dataset that flagged the IP address (`cf.intel.ip.datasets` — values: `ddos`, `waf`)

You can review matches in [Security Analytics](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/analytics/security-analytics/) to see which threat actors and campaigns are reaching your application.

Caution

IP addresses are often shared through NAT, proxies, and cloud providers. Test rules with the _Log_ action first and combine threat intelligence with other signals — such as [attack score](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/detections/attack-score/) — before you block.

## Data freshness

The threat intelligence database reflects a rolling seven-day window:

* An IP address flagged earlier in the window still matches, even if the threat is no longer active.
* An IP address ages out seven days after the last observed activity. Rules that matched it stop matching with no notification.

## Availability

Requires an active [Cloudforce One](https://developers.cloudflare.com/security-center/cloudforce-one/) subscription. Contact your account team for access.

The WAF must be enabled on your zone before threat intelligence fields can be used in rule expressions.
