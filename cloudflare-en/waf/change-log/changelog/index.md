**WAF Release - 2026-07-29**  

This release introduces new rules and updates existing threat signatures to provide targeted protections for vulnerabilities in Nuxt Server Island components and Alibaba Fastjson deserialization routines, alongside enhanced protections for cloud metadata Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) and obfuscated command injection attempts.

**Key Findings**

* Nuxt Server Island - RCE(GHSA-9473-5f9j-94wq): An unauthenticated vulnerability in Nuxt Server Islands where remote attackers can supply arbitrary component names or props to endpoints. Manipulating these parameters allows unauthenticated component Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server.
* Alibaba Fastjson JSONType Remote Code Execution: A unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability in Alibaba Fastjson (≤ 1.2.83) during JSON deserialization. Under default configurations, attackers can execute arbitrary system commands, bypassing traditional classpath and gadget-based defenses.
* Generic Protections (SSRF & Command Injection): Added improved detection logic targeting Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in cloud-hosted applications, alongside new rules targeting obfuscated command injection patterns across request parameters.

**WAF Release - 2026-07-21**  

This release introduces new rules for vulnerabilities in Adobe ColdFusion, Next.js, WordPress alongside updates to existing rules thereby providing enhanced generic protections against Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), Local File Inclusion (LFI), and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**WAF and framework adapter mitigations for Next.js vulnerabilities**

Multiple [security vulnerabilities ↗](https://nextjs.org/blog/july-2026-security-release) were disclosed and patched by the Next.js team through July 2026 security release. These include denial of service, middleware and proxy bypass, server-side request forgery, information disclosure, and cache poisoning across a range of severities.

Several of the disclosed vulnerabilities are not possible to block at WAF layer,we strongly recommend updating your application and its dependencies immediately. Patched versions are available through v16.2.11 (Active LTS) and v15.5.21 (Maintenance LTS) to address these issues.

**Use Cloudforce One threat intelligence in WAF rules**  

You can now match incoming requests against Cloudforce One threat intelligence in your WAF rules. A new detection looks up the client IP address of each request against the threat intelligence database. If the IP was involved in threat activity in the past seven days, Cloudflare populates `cf.intel.ip.*` fields that you can use in [custom rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/custom-rules/) and [rate limiting rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/rate-limiting-rules/).

The detection populates the following fields. Use the [any()](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/rules-language/functions/#any) function with the `[*]` wildcard to match array values:

* `cf.intel.ip.datasets` — the dataset that flagged the IP address (`ddos` or `waf`).
* `cf.intel.ip.target_industries` — industries the IP address has targeted.
* `cf.intel.ip.attacker_names` — known threat actors associated with the IP address.
* `cf.intel.ip.attacker_countries` — source countries of the threat activity.
* `cf.intel.ip.target_countries` — countries the IP address has targeted.

For example, the following custom rule expression blocks requests from IP addresses associated with DDoS activity that have targeted France:

```txt
any(cf.intel.ip.target_countries[*] == "FR") and any(cf.intel.ip.datasets[*] == "ddos")
```

These fields work with the Cloudflare API and Terraform. Matches are logged in [Security Analytics](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/analytics/security-analytics/).

The threat intelligence detection is available to customers with an active [Cloudforce One](https://developers.cloudflare.com/security-center/cloudforce-one/) subscription. For more information, refer to [Threat intelligence](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/detections/threat-intelligence/).

**WAF Release - 2026-06-09**  

This release introduces new detections for a critical SQL injection vulnerability in Drupal installations utilizing PostgreSQL (CVE-2026-9082), alongside targeted protection for an unsafe deserialization flaw in the Mirasvit Cache Warmer extension (CVE-2026-45247). Additionally, this release includes coverage for a prototype pollution vector in Axios (CVE-2026-40175) and a new generic rule designed to identify and block sophisticated SQL Injection (SQLi) bypass attempts leveraging obfuscated boolean logic.

**Key Findings**

* CVE-2026-9082: A database abstraction vulnerability affects Drupal sites configured with a PostgreSQL backend. Remote, unauthenticated attackers can exploit this flaw via crafted inputs to inject malicious SQL commands and access or manipulate backend data.
* CVE-2026-45247: A PHP Object Injection vulnerability exists in the Mirasvit Cache Warmer extension for Magento and Adobe Commerce. This flaw stems from unsafe deserialization of untrusted user input, enabling unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary code on the hosting server.
* CVE-2026-40175: A prototype pollution vulnerability affects the Axios HTTP client library. Attackers can exploit this to inject malicious properties into the global JavaScript object prototype, potentially causing application crashes (Denial of Service) or executing unauthorized code depending on the application structure.

**Impact**

Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary code, manipulate database contents, or induce application crashes, leading to severe operational disruption or complete server compromise. These newly deployed signatures intercept these advanced malicious payloads at the edge before they can interact with vulnerable software configurations.

**WAF Release - 2026-05-15 - Emergency**  

This emergency release introduces two new rules to detect nginx heap buffer overflow and heap spray exploitation attempts targeting the rewrite module's `is_args` stale-state bug (CVE-2026-42945).

**Key Findings**

CVE-2026-42945: nginx Heap Buffer Overflow via Stale `is_args` in Rewrite Module

Successful exploitation allows remote attackers to trigger a heap buffer overflow in nginx's rewrite module by sending crafted URIs containing escapable characters. A length/copy pass mismatch in `ngx_http_script_copy_capture_code()` causes the copy pass to write escaped data into an undersized buffer, leading to heap corruption. This enables denial of service (worker process crash) and, with heap feng shui techniques, potential remote code execution.

We strongly recommend upgrading to nginx 1.30.1 (or later) immediately to address the underlying vulnerability. If you cannot upgrade immediately, avoid `rewrite` directives with `?` in the replacement string followed by `set` or `if` referencing capture groups.

**WAF and framework adapter mitigations for React and Next.js vulnerabilities**  

Multiple security vulnerabilities were disclosed by the React team and Vercel affecting React Server Components and Next.js. These include denial of service, middleware and proxy bypass, server-side request forgery, cross-site scripting, and cache poisoning issues across a range of severity levels.

**We strongly recommend updating your application and its dependencies immediately.** Patched versions are available for React (`react-server-dom-webpack`, `react-server-dom-parcel`, and `react-server-dom-turbopack` `19.0.6`, `19.1.7`, and `19.2.6`) and Next.js (`15.5.16` and `16.2.5`).

#### WAF protections

Cloudflare WAF rules deployed in response to prior React Server Component CVEs ([CVE-2025-55184 ↗](https://github.com/facebook/react/security/advisories/GHSA-2m3v-v2m8-q956) and [CVE-2026-23864 ↗](https://github.com/facebook/react/security/advisories/GHSA-83fc-fqcc-2hmg)) already provide coverage for the newly disclosed denial-of-service vulnerabilities. These rules are enabled by default with a Block action for all customers using the Cloudflare Managed Ruleset, including Free plan customers using the Free Managed Ruleset.

| Ruleset                    | Rule description                                                                                            | Rule ID                          | Default action |

The existing rules detect the underlying attack patterns generically. As a result, they apply to the new [CVE-2026-23870 ↗](https://github.com/facebook/react/security/advisories/GHSA-rv78-f8rc-xrxh) denial-of-service vulnerability in Server Components and the corresponding Next.js advisory [GHSA-8h8q-6873-q5fj ↗](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/security/advisories/GHSA-8h8q-6873-q5fj).

Cloudflare is investigating whether WAF rules can be safely and effectively deployed for three of the high-severity advisories: [CVE-2026-23870 ↗](https://github.com/facebook/react/security/advisories/GHSA-rv78-f8rc-xrxh) / [GHSA-8h8q-6873-q5fj ↗](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/security/advisories/GHSA-8h8q-6873-q5fj), [GHSA-267c-6grr-h53f ↗](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/security/advisories/GHSA-267c-6grr-h53f), and [GHSA-mg66-mrh9-m8jx ↗](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/security/advisories/GHSA-mg66-mrh9-m8jx). If it is possible to create a managed WAF rule that mitigates these CVEs and does not potentially break application behavior, Cloudflare will add additional managed WAF rules. These rules will be announced through the [WAF changelog](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/change-log/changelog/). Because these vulnerabilities were shared with Cloudflare with minimal advance notice, we are still investigating what WAF mitigations are possible.

Several of the disclosed vulnerabilities are not possible to block in WAF. We strongly recommend updating your applications so they are not purely reliant on WAF mitigations.

Customers on Pro, Business, or Enterprise plans should ensure that [Managed Rules are enabled](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/get-started/#1-deploy-the-cloudflare-managed-ruleset).

#### Next.js adapters

**Vinext:** [Vinext ↗](https://github.com/cloudflare/vinext) is a Vite plugin that reimplements the Next.js API surface. Vinext's latest release is not vulnerable to any of the disclosed CVEs. Vinext's architecture differs from stock Next.js in ways that sidestep the affected code paths. For example, it does not implement the PPR resume protocol, does not expose Pages Router data-route endpoints, and strips internal headers such as `x-nextjs-data` at request boundaries. As an extra layer of defense, we added a React `19.2.6` or later requirement when running `vinext init` ([PR #1118 ↗](https://github.com/cloudflare/vinext/pull/1118), [PR #1112 ↗](https://github.com/cloudflare/vinext/pull/1112)) to prevent accidentally running a vulnerable version of React with Vinext.

**OpenNext on Cloudflare:** OpenNext is an adapter that lets you deploy Next.js apps to the Cloudflare Workers platform. OpenNext itself is not directly vulnerable to the React denial-of-service CVE, but users must update the Next.js version in their application. The OpenNext team has updated the adapter to further harden against these vectors and released a new version of the Cloudflare adapter. Test fixtures and examples have been updated to use patched versions ([PR #1255 ↗](https://github.com/opennextjs/opennextjs-cloudflare/pull/1255)).

**WAF Release - 2026-05-07 - Emergency**  

This emergency release introduces a new rule to detect Next.js App Router middleware and proxy bypass attempts via segment-prefetch routes (CVE-2026-44575).

**Key Findings**

CVE-2026-44575: Next.js Middleware / Proxy Bypass in App Router Applications via Segment-Prefetch Routes

Successful exploitation allows unauthenticated attackers to bypass middleware or proxy-based authorization checks in affected Next.js App Router applications. This leads to unauthorized access to protected content, potential exposure of sensitive application data, and compromise of application security boundaries.

We strongly recommend upgrading to Next.js 15.5.16 or 16.2.5 (or later) immediately to address the underlying vulnerability. If you cannot upgrade immediately, enforce authorization in the underlying route or page logic instead of relying solely on middleware.

**WAF Release - 2026-05-04**  

This week's release focuses on new detections to expand coverage across command injection, SQL injection, PHP object injection, remote code execution, and XSS attack vectors.

**Key Findings**

* Existing rule enhancements have been deployed to improve detection resilience against broad classes of web attacks and strengthen behavioral coverage.

**Continuous Rule Improvements**

We are continuously refining our managed rules to provide more resilient protection and deeper insights into attack patterns. To ensure an optimal security posture, we recommend consistently monitoring the Security Events dashboard and adjusting rule actions as these enhancements are deployed.

**WAF Release - 2026-04-30 - Emergency**  

This emergency release introduces a new rule to block a cPanel & WHM Authentication Bypass related to CVE-2026-41940.

**Key Findings**

* CVE-2026-41940: A critical authentication bypass vulnerability in cPanel & WHM allows unauthenticated remote attackers to bypass authentication mechanisms and gain unauthorized administrative access to the web hosting control panel. This vulnerability affects the session validation logic, enabling attackers to craft malicious requests that circumvent normal authentication checks.

**Impact**

Successful exploitation allows unauthenticated attackers to gain administrative control over affected cPanel & WHM installations. This leads to complete server compromise, potential theft or manipulation of hosted data, and significant service disruption across managed environments.

We strongly recommend applying official vendor patches for cPanel & WHM immediately to address the underlying vulnerability.

**WAF Release - 2026-04-21**  

This week's release introduces a new detection for a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in Apache ActiveMQ (CVE-2026-34197) and an updated signature for Magento 2 - Unrestricted File Upload. Alongside these detections, we are continuing our work on rule refinements to provide deeper security insights for our customers.

**Key Findings**

* Apache ActiveMQ (CVE-2026-34197): A vulnerability in Apache ActiveMQ allows an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code. This flaw occurs during the processing of specially crafted network packets, leading to potential full system compromise.
* Magento 2 - Unrestricted File Upload - 2: This is a follow-up enhancement to our existing protections for Magento and Adobe Commerce.

**Impact**

Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary code or gain full administrative control over affected servers. We strongly recommend applying official vendor patches for Apache ActiveMQ and Magento to address the underlying vulnerabilities.

**Continuous Rule Improvements**

We are continuously refining our managed rules to provide more resilient protection and deeper insights into attack patterns. To ensure an optimal security posture, we recommend consistently monitoring the Security Events dashboard and adjusting rule actions as these enhancements are deployed.

This week's release introduces a new detection for a critical Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in Mesop (CVE-2026-33057), alongside protections for high-impact vulnerabilities in Cisco Secure Firewall Management Center (CVE-2026-20079) and FortiClient EMS (CVE-2026-21643). Additionally, this release includes an update to our existing React Server DoS coverage to address recently identified resource exhaustion vectors (CVE-2026-23869).

**Key Findings**

* Cisco Secure FMC (CVE-2026-20079): A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Secure Firewall Management Center (FMC) that allows an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands or bypass security filters.
* FortiClient EMS (CVE-2026-21643): A critical vulnerability in the FortiClient EMS permitting unauthorized access or administrative configuration manipulation via crafted HTTP requests.
* Mesop (CVE-2026-33057): A vulnerability in the Mesop Python-based UI framework where unauthenticated attackers can execute arbitrary code by sending specially crafted, Base64-encoded payloads in the request body.

**Impact**

Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary code, gain administrative control over network management infrastructure, or trigger server-side resource exhaustion. Administrators are strongly encouraged to apply official vendor updates.

**Email obfuscation decode script is now non-render-blocking**  

The decode script injected by [Email Address Obfuscation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/tools/scrape-shield/email-address-obfuscation/) now loads with the `defer` attribute. This means the script no longer blocks page rendering. It downloads in parallel with HTML parsing and executes after the document is fully parsed, before the `DOMContentLoaded` event.

This improves page loading performance, contributing to better Core Web Vitals, for all zones with Email Address Obfuscation on. No action is required.

If you have custom JavaScript that depends on email addresses being decoded at a specific point during page load, note that the decode script now executes after HTML parsing completes rather than inline during parsing.

**WAF Release - 2026-04-07**  

This week's release introduces new detections for a critical Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in MCP Server (CVE-2026-23744), alongside targeted protection for an authentication bypass vulnerability in SolarWinds products (CVE-2025-40552). Additionally, this release includes a new generic detection rule designed to identify and block Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) injection attempts leveraging "OnEvent" handlers within HTTP cookies.

**Key Findings**

* MCP Server (CVE-2026-23744): A vulnerability in the Model Context Protocol (MCP) server implementation where malformed input payloads can trigger a memory corruption state, allowing for arbitrary code execution.
* SolarWinds (CVE-2025-40552): A critical flaw in the authentication module allows unauthenticated attackers to bypass security filters and gain unauthorized access to the management console due to improper identity token validation.
* XSS OnEvents Cookies: This generic rule identifies malicious event handlers (such as onload or onerror) embedded within HTTP cookie values.

**Impact**

Successful exploitation of the MCP Server and SolarWinds vulnerabilities could allow unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary code or gain administrative control, leading to a full system takeover. Additionally, the new generic XSS detection prevents attackers from leveraging browser event handlers in cookies to hijack user sessions or execute malicious scripts.

**WAF Release - 2026-03-30**  

This week's release introduces new detections for a critical authentication bypass vulnerability in Fortinet products (CVE-2025-59718), alongside three new generic detection rules designed to identify and block HTTP Parameter Pollution attempts. Additionally, this release includes targeted protection for a high-impact unrestricted file upload vulnerability in Magento and Adobe Commerce.

**Key Findings**

* CVE-2025-59718: An improper cryptographic signature verification vulnerability in Fortinet FortiOS, FortiProxy, and FortiSwitchManager. This may allow an unauthenticated attacker to bypass the FortiCloud SSO login authentication using a maliciously crafted SAML message, if that feature is enabled on the device.
* Magento 2 - Unrestricted File Upload: A critical flaw in Magento and Adobe Commerce allows unauthenticated attackers to bypass security checks and upload malicious files to the server, potentially leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE).

**Impact**

Successful exploitation of the Fortinet and Magento vulnerabilities could allow unauthenticated attackers to gain administrative control or deploy webshells, leading to complete server compromise and data theft.
