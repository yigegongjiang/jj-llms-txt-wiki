## 2026-09-07

  
**Enforce positive security with Application Profiles**  

Application Profiles add a positive-security layer to Cloudflare WAF. Instead of looking only for requests that resemble known attacks, Application Profiles learn what valid requests to your application look like and identify traffic that deviates from the expected structure.

The first available profile type, Schema Profiles, can learn path variables, query parameters, headers, cookies, JSON bodies, and form-encoded bodies. Profiles model field types and constraints such as numeric ranges, string lengths, and character classes. After a profile becomes available, an always-on detection classifies requests as conforming or non-conforming without blocking traffic.

Use **Profile Analysis** in [Security Analytics](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/analytics/security-analytics/) to review conformance trends and sampled violation details before enforcing a profile. When you are ready to mitigate traffic, use a [Custom Rule](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/custom-rules/) to scope enforcement by hostname, path, operation, or other security signals such as Attack Score.

Customers with API Security already have access to Schema Profiles through Schema Learning and Schema Validation. Cloudflare is also opening a closed beta to invited Enterprise customers without API Security. Contact your Cloudflare account team to express interest.

For more information, refer to [Application Profiles](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/detections/application-profiles/).

## 2026-08-20

  
**Leaked credentials detection now scans Authorization headers**  

[Leaked credentials detection](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/detections/leaked-credentials/) now scans the `Authorization` request header for Basic Authentication credentials. Previously, the detection only inspected request bodies, query strings, and headers for well-known web applications or custom detection locations, which meant credentials sent through HTTP Basic Authentication were not covered by default.

This new default scan location decodes the `Authorization: Basic <credentials>` header and compares the extracted username and password against Cloudflare's database of leaked credentials, the same way as other default scan locations. Matches populate the existing [leaked credentials fields](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/detections/leaked-credentials/#leaked-credentials-fields), such as `cf.waf.credential_check.password_leaked`, and trigger the [`Exposed-Credential-Check` managed transform header](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/transform/managed-transforms/reference/#add-leaked-credentials-checks-header) if configured, so you can reuse existing [custom rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/custom-rules/) and [rate limiting rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/rate-limiting-rules/) without changes.

This change was applied automatically for zones with leaked credentials detection enabled. No configuration changes are required.

**WAF Release - 2026-07-21**  

This release introduces new rules for vulnerabilities in Adobe ColdFusion, Next.js, WordPress alongside updates to existing rules thereby providing enhanced generic protections against Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), Local File Inclusion (LFI), and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**WAF and framework adapter mitigations for Next.js vulnerabilities**

Multiple [security vulnerabilities ↗︎](https://nextjs.org/blog/july-2026-security-release) were disclosed and patched by the Next.js team through July 2026 security release. These include denial of service, middleware and proxy bypass, server-side request forgery, information disclosure, and cache poisoning across a range of severities.

Several of the disclosed vulnerabilities are not possible to block at WAF layer,we strongly recommend updating your application and its dependencies immediately. Patched versions are available through v16.2.11 (Active LTS) and v15.5.21 (Maintenance LTS) to address these issues.

| Advisory | CVE | Severity | Issue | WAF Coverage |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Denial of Service in App Router using Server Actions](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/security/advisories/GHSA-m99w-x7hq-7vfj) | CVE-2026-64641 | High | Crafted requests targeting Next.js applications using App Router with at least one Server Action can lead to excessive CPU usage. The CPU usage blocks processing of further requests in the same process, leading to Denial of Service. | WAF rule Next.js - DoS - CVE-2026-64641 (...90dcdb0a) has been deployed to provide coverage. |
| [Middleware / Proxy bypass in App Router applications using Turbopack and single locale](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/security/advisories/GHSA-6gpp-xcg3-4w24) | CVE-2026-64642 | High | Next.js applications using App Router built with Turbopack and a single entry in config.i18n.locales are vulnerable to a middleware/proxy bypass. Accordingly, any authentication or security checks that a middleware/proxy may perform are bypassed. | This is a middleware bypass that unfortunately cannot be covered through Cloudflare WAF signature engine. |
| [Server-Side Request Forgery in rewrites via attacker-controlled destination hostname](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/security/advisories/GHSA-p9j2-gv94-2wf4) | CVE-2026-64645 | High | A rewrites() or redirects() rule that builds its external destination hostname from request-controlled input can be pointed at an arbitrary hostname, regardless of the rule's hostname suffix. For rewrites, this behavior enables Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF); for redirects, Open Redirect can be achieved. | Existing SSRF rules provide adequate coverage for this vulnerability, no tailored WAF rule was developed. |
| [Server-Side Request Forgery in Server Actions on custom servers](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/security/advisories/GHSA-89xv-2m56-2m9x) | CVE-2026-64649 | High | When a Server Action forwards or redirects a request, an attacker can cause the server to send that outbound request to a malicious host (Server-Side Request Forgery). This requires the attacker’s request to control Host-associated headers. | WAF rule Next.js - SSRF - CVE-2026-64649 (...930091a3) has been deployed to provide coverage. |
| [Denial of Service in the Image Optimization API using SVGs](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/security/advisories/GHSA-q8wf-6r8g-63ch) | CVE-2026-64644 | Medium | When self-hosting Next.js with the default image loader, the Image Optimization API can optimize remotely hosted images if configured (not enabled by default). If those images contain malicious content, the images can cause CPU exhaustion in the /\_next/image endpoint. | Malicious request is unfortunately indistinguishable from a legitimate image optimization request, so no WAF rule has been created to address this vulnerability. |
| [Unbounded Server Action payload in Edge runtime](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/security/advisories/GHSA-4c39-4ccg-62r3) | CVE-2026-64646 | Medium | A crafted request can lead to memory consumption on Server Actions in the Edge runtime. Next.js applications which use App Router and have at least one Server Action are affected. | Unfortunately there is no one size fits all rule that can be deployed through WAF in lieu of custom bodySizeLimit configurations, so no WAF rule has been created to address this vulnerability. |
| [Unauthenticated disclosure of internal Server Function endpoints](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/security/advisories/GHSA-955p-x3mx-jcvp) | CVE-2026-64643 | Medium | In Next.js applications using App Router, Server Actions (use server) or use cache endpoint IDs can be globally disclosed. An attacker can use this for reconnaissance and as part of a broader attack chain. | WAF rule Next.js - Information Disclosure - CVE-2026-64643 (...72952826) has been deployed to provide coverage. |
| [Cache confusion of response bodies for requests with bodies](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/security/advisories/GHSA-68g3-v927-f742) | CVE-2026-64648 | Medium | A server-side fetch with a request body may return a cached response body from a different request to the same URL but different body. This only applies for fetch calls of the shape fetch(new Request(init), aDifferentInit) | This is an application logic bug that unfortunately cannot be covered through Cloudflare WAF signature engine. |
| [Cache confusion of response bodies for requests with bodies containing invalid UTF-8 byte sequences](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/security/advisories/GHSA-4633-3j49-mh5q) | CVE-2026-64647 | Medium | A server-side fetch with a request body may return a cached response body from a different request to the same URL but different body. This only applies when receiving request bodies which contain invalid UTF-8 characters. | This is an application logic bug that unfortunately cannot be covered through Cloudflare WAF signature engine. |

**Use Cloudforce One threat intelligence in WAF rules**  

You can now match incoming requests against Cloudforce One threat intelligence in your WAF rules. A new detection looks up the client IP address of each request against the threat intelligence database. If the IP was involved in threat activity in the past seven days, Cloudflare populates `cf.intel.ip.*` fields that you can use in [custom rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/custom-rules/) and [rate limiting rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/rate-limiting-rules/).

The detection populates the following fields. Use the [`any()`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/rules-language/functions/#any) function with the `[*]` wildcard to match array values:

- `cf.intel.ip.datasets` — the dataset that flagged the IP address ( `ddos` or `waf`).
- `cf.intel.ip.target_industries` — industries the IP address has targeted.
- `cf.intel.ip.attacker_names` — known threat actors associated with the IP address.
- `cf.intel.ip.attacker_countries` — source countries of the threat activity.
- `cf.intel.ip.target_countries` — countries the IP address has targeted.

For example, the following custom rule expression blocks requests from IP addresses associated with DDoS activity that have targeted France:

```txt
any(cf.intel.ip.target_countries[*] == "FR") and any(cf.intel.ip.datasets[*] == "ddos")
```

These fields work with the Cloudflare API and Terraform. Matches are logged in [Security Analytics](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/analytics/security-analytics/).

The threat intelligence detection is available to customers with an active [Cloudforce One](https://developers.cloudflare.com/security-center/cloudforce-one/) subscription. For more information, refer to [Threat intelligence](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/detections/threat-intelligence/).

**WAF Release - 2026-06-09**  

This release introduces new detections for a critical SQL injection vulnerability in Drupal installations utilizing PostgreSQL (CVE-2026-9082), alongside targeted protection for an unsafe deserialization flaw in the Mirasvit Cache Warmer extension (CVE-2026-45247). Additionally, this release includes coverage for a prototype pollution vector in Axios (CVE-2026-40175) and a new generic rule designed to identify and block sophisticated SQL Injection (SQLi) bypass attempts leveraging obfuscated boolean logic.

**Key Findings**

- CVE-2026-9082: A database abstraction vulnerability affects Drupal sites configured with a PostgreSQL backend. Remote, unauthenticated attackers can exploit this flaw via crafted inputs to inject malicious SQL commands and access or manipulate backend data.
- CVE-2026-45247: A PHP Object Injection vulnerability exists in the Mirasvit Cache Warmer extension for Magento and Adobe Commerce. This flaw stems from unsafe deserialization of untrusted user input, enabling unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary code on the hosting server.
- CVE-2026-40175: A prototype pollution vulnerability affects the Axios HTTP client library. Attackers can exploit this to inject malicious properties into the global JavaScript object prototype, potentially causing application crashes (Denial of Service) or executing unauthorized code depending on the application structure.

**Impact**

Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary code, manipulate database contents, or induce application crashes, leading to severe operational disruption or complete server compromise. These newly deployed signatures intercept these advanced malicious payloads at the edge before they can interact with vulnerable software configurations.

**WAF Release - 2026-05-15 - Emergency**  

This emergency release introduces two new rules to detect nginx heap buffer overflow and heap spray exploitation attempts targeting the rewrite module's `is_args` stale-state bug (CVE-2026-42945).

**Key Findings**

CVE-2026-42945: nginx Heap Buffer Overflow via Stale `is_args` in Rewrite Module

Successful exploitation allows remote attackers to trigger a heap buffer overflow in nginx's rewrite module by sending crafted URIs containing escapable characters. A length/copy pass mismatch in `ngx_http_script_copy_capture_code()` causes the copy pass to write escaped data into an undersized buffer, leading to heap corruption. This enables denial of service (worker process crash) and, with heap feng shui techniques, potential remote code execution.

We strongly recommend upgrading to nginx 1.30.1 (or later) immediately to address the underlying vulnerability. If you cannot upgrade immediately, avoid `rewrite` directives with `?` in the replacement string followed by `set` or `if` referencing capture groups.
