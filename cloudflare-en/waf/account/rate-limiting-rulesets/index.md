# Rate limiting rulesets

Last updated Apr 16, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/account/rate-limiting-rulesets/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

[Rate limiting rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/rate-limiting-rules/) allow you to define a rate limit for requests matching an [expression](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/rules-language/expressions/), and the action to perform when that rate limit is reached. You can configure rate limiting rules for a single zone or at the account level.

Account-level rate limiting rulesets allow you to define rate limiting rules once and deploy them to multiple Enterprise zones. Instead of configuring the same rules in each zone, you create a ruleset at the account level and control which zones it applies to.

Note

This feature requires an Enterprise plan.

To apply a rate limiting ruleset at the account level:

1. Create a rate limiting ruleset with one or more rate limiting rules.
2. Deploy the ruleset to one or more zones on an Enterprise plan.
