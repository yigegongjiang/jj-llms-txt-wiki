# Custom rulesets (account level)

Last updated Aug 25, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/account/custom-rulesets/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Note

Custom rulesets at the account level require an Enterprise plan.

Custom rulesets are collections of custom rules that you can deploy at the account or [zone level](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/custom-rules/custom-rulesets/).

Like [custom rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/custom-rules/) at the zone level, custom rulesets allow you to control incoming traffic by filtering requests.

Account-level custom rulesets allow you to define a set of custom rules once and apply them across multiple Enterprise zones in your account. Instead of configuring each zone individually, you create a ruleset at the account level and use expressions to control which zones and traffic it applies to.

At the zone level, all customers can create and deploy custom rulesets. Custom rulesets at the account level require an Enterprise plan. For more details, refer to [Availability](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/custom-rules/#availability).
