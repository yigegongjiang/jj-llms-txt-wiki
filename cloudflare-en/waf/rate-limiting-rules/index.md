# Rate limiting rules

Last updated Apr 22, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/rate-limiting-rules/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Rate limiting rules allow you to define rate limits for requests matching an expression, and the action to perform when those rate limits are reached. Use rate limiting rules to prevent abuse of your websites and APIs — for example, to protect a login endpoint from brute-force attacks or to cap how many API calls a single client can make in a given time window.

Were you blocked from accessing a website?

If you are a visitor who received an error while trying to access a website, please refer to the [error 1015 documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/support/troubleshooting/http-status-codes/cloudflare-1xxx-errors/error-1015).

In the [new security dashboard](https://developers.cloudflare.com/security/), rate limiting rules are one of the available types of [security rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/security/rules/). Security rules perform security-related actions on incoming requests that match specified filters.

Some Enterprise customers can create [rate limiting rulesets](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/account/rate-limiting-rulesets/) at the account level that they can deploy to multiple Enterprise zones.

## Rule parameters

Like other rules evaluated by Cloudflare's [Ruleset Engine](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/), rate limiting rules have the following basic parameters:

* An [expression](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/rules-language/expressions/) that specifies the criteria you are matching traffic on using the [Rules language](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/rules-language/).
* An [action](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/rules-language/actions/) that specifies what to perform when there is a match for the rule and any additional conditions are met. In the case of rate limiting rules, the action occurs when the rate reaches the specified limit.

Besides these two parameters, rate limiting rules require the following additional parameters:

* **Characteristics**: The set of parameters that define how Cloudflare tracks the rate for this rule.
* **Period**: The period of time to consider (in seconds) when evaluating the rate.
* **Requests per period**: The number of requests over the period of time that will trigger the rate limiting rule.
* **Duration** (or mitigation timeout): Once the rate is reached, the rate limiting rule blocks further requests for the period of time defined in this field.
* **Action behavior**: By default, Cloudflare will apply the rule action for the configured duration (or mitigation timeout), regardless of the request rate during this period. Some Enterprise customers can configure the rule to [throttle requests](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/rate-limiting-rules/parameters/#with-the-following-behavior) over the maximum rate, allowing incoming requests when the rate is lower than the configured limit.

Refer to [Rate limiting parameters](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/rate-limiting-rules/parameters/) for more information on mandatory and optional parameters.

Refer to [How Cloudflare determines the request rate](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/rate-limiting-rules/request-rate/) to learn how Cloudflare uses the parameters above when determining the rate of incoming requests.

## Interaction with other app security features

If you are using several app security features like custom rules, Managed Rules, and Super Bot Fight Mode, it is important to understand how these features interact and the order in which they execute. Refer to [Security features interoperability](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/feature-interoperability/) for more information.

## Important remarks

* Rate limiting rules are evaluated in order, and some actions like _Block_ will stop the evaluation of other rules. For more details on actions and their behavior, refer to [Actions](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/rules-language/actions/).
* Rate limiting rules are not designed to allow a precise number of requests to reach your origin server. There may be a delay of up to a few seconds between detecting a request and updating rate counters. Due to this delay, excess requests could still reach the origin before Cloudflare enforces a mitigation action such as blocking or challenging. For more information on how counters work, including their per-data-center scope, refer to [Request rate calculation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/rate-limiting-rules/request-rate/).
* Applying rate limiting rules to verified bots might affect Search Engine Optimization (SEO). For more information, refer to [Improve SEO](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/performance/improve-seo/).
