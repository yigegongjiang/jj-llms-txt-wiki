# Configure payload logging via API

Last updated May 5, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/managed-rules/payload-logging/configure-api/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Use the [Rulesets API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/rulesets-api/) to configure payload logging for a managed ruleset via API.

## Configure and enable payload logging

1. Use the [Get a zone entry point ruleset](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/rulesets/subresources/phases/methods/get/) operation to obtain the following IDs:

  * The ID of the [entry point ruleset](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/about/rulesets/#entry-point-ruleset) of the `http_request_firewall_managed` [phase](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/about/phases/).
  * The ID of the `execute` rule deploying the WAF managed ruleset, for which you want to configure payload logging.
2. Use the [Update a zone ruleset rule](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/rulesets/methods/update/) operation to update the rule you identified in the previous step.  
Include a `matched_data` object in the rule's `action_parameters` object to configure payload logging. The `matched_data` object has the following structure:  
```json  
"action_parameters": {  
  // ...  
  "matched_data": {  
    "public_key": "<PUBLIC_KEY_VALUE>"  
  }  
}  
```  
Replace `<PUBLIC_KEY_VALUE>` with the public key you want to use for payload logging. You can generate a public key [in the command line](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/managed-rules/payload-logging/command-line/generate-key-pair/) or [in the Cloudflare dashboard](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/managed-rules/payload-logging/configure/).

Account-level configuration

To configure payload logging for a managed ruleset deployed at the account level (only available on Enterprise plans), use the following API operations instead:

* In step 1: [Get an account entry point ruleset](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/rulesets/subresources/phases/methods/get/)
* In step 2: [Update an account ruleset rule](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/rulesets/subresources/rules/methods/edit/)

### Example

This example configures payload logging for the [Cloudflare Managed Ruleset](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/managed-rules/reference/cloudflare-managed-ruleset/), which is already deployed for a zone with ID `$ZONE_ID`.

1. Invoke the [Get a zone entry point ruleset](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/rulesets/subresources/phases/methods/get/) operation to obtain the rules currently configured in the entry point ruleset of the `http_request_firewall_managed` phase.  
```bash  
curl "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/$ZONE_ID/rulesets/phases/http_request_firewall_managed/entrypoint" \
	--request GET \
	--header "Authorization: Bearer $CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN"  
```  
```json  
{  
	"result": {  
		"id": "060013b1eeb14c93b0dcd896537e0d2c", // entry point ruleset ID  
		"name": "default",  
		"description": "",  
		"source": "firewall_managed",  
		"kind": "zone",  
		"version": "3",  
		"rules": [  
			// (...)  
			{  
				"id": "1bdb49371c1f46958fc8b985efcb79e7", // `execute` rule ID  
				"version": "1",  
				"action": "execute",  
				"expression": "true",  
				"last_updated": "2024-01-20T14:21:28.643979Z",  
				"ref": "1bdb49371c1f46958fc8b985efcb79e7",  
				"enabled": true,  
				"action_parameters": {  
					"id": "efb7b8c949ac4650a09736fc376e9aee", // "Cloudflare Managed Ruleset" ID  
					"version": "latest"  
				}  
			}  
			// (...)  
		],  
		"last_updated": "2024-01-20T14:29:00.190643Z",  
		"phase": "http_request_firewall_managed"  
	},  
	"success": true,  
	"errors": [],  
	"messages": []  
}  
```
2. Save the following IDs for the next step:

  * The ID of the entry point ruleset: `060013b1eeb14c93b0dcd896537e0d2c`
  * The ID of the `execute` rule deploying the Cloudflare Managed Ruleset: `1bdb49371c1f46958fc8b985efcb79e7`  
To find the correct rule in the `rules` array, search for an `execute` rule containing the ID of the Cloudflare Managed Ruleset (...376e9aee) in `action_parameters` \> `id`.  
Note  
To get the IDs of existing WAF managed rulesets, refer to [Available managed rulesets](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/managed-rules/#available-managed-rulesets) or use the [List account rulesets](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/rulesets/methods/list/) operation.
3. Invoke the [Update a zone ruleset rule](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/rulesets/methods/update/) operation to update the configuration of the rule you identified. The rule will now include the payload logging configuration (`matched_data` object).  
```bash  
curl "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/$ZONE_ID/rulesets/060013b1eeb14c93b0dcd896537e0d2c/rules/1bdb49371c1f46958fc8b985efcb79e7" \
	--request PATCH \
	--header "Authorization: Bearer $CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN" \
	--json '{  
		"action": "execute",  
		"action_parameters": {  
				"id": "efb7b8c949ac4650a09736fc376e9aee",  
				"matched_data": {  
						"public_key": "Ycig/Zr/pZmklmFUN99nr+taURlYItL91g+NcHGYpB8="  
				}  
		},  
		"expression": "true"  
	}'  
```  
The response will include the complete ruleset after updating the rule.

For more information on deploying managed rulesets via API, refer to [Deploy a managed ruleset](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/managed-rulesets/deploy-managed-ruleset/) in the Ruleset Engine documentation.

## Disable payload logging

To disable payload logging for a managed ruleset:

1. Use the [Update a zone ruleset rule](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/rulesets/methods/update/) operation to update the rule deploying the managed ruleset (a rule with `"action": "execute"`).
2. Modify the rule definition so that there is no `matched_data` object in `action_parameters`.

For example, the following `PATCH` request updates the rule with ID `$RULE_ID` deploying the [Cloudflare Managed Ruleset](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/managed-rules/reference/cloudflare-managed-ruleset/) so that payload logging is disabled:

```bash
curl "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/$ZONE_ID/rulesets/$RULESET_ID/rules/$RULE_ID" \
	--request PATCH \
	--header "Authorization: Bearer $CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN" \
	--json '{
		"action": "execute",
		"action_parameters": {
				"id": "efb7b8c949ac4650a09736fc376e9aee"
		},
		"expression": "true"
	}'
```

For details on obtaining the entry point ruleset ID and the ID of the rule to update, refer to [Configure and enable payload logging](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/managed-rules/payload-logging/configure-api/#configure-and-enable-payload-logging).
