# Generate a key pair

Last updated May 5, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/managed-rules/payload-logging/command-line/generate-key-pair/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Generate a public/private key pair using the Cloudflare [matched-data-cli ↗](https://github.com/cloudflare/matched-data-cli) command-line tool. After generating a key pair, enter the generated public key in the payload logging configuration.

Do the following:

1. [Download ↗](https://github.com/cloudflare/matched-data-cli/releases) the `matched-data-cli` tool for your platform from the **Releases** page on GitHub, under **Assets**.
2. Extract the content of the downloaded `.tar.gz` file to a local folder.
3. Open a terminal and go to the local folder containing the `matched-data-cli` tool.  
```sh  
cd matched-data-cli  
```
4. Run the following command:  
```sh  
./matched-data-cli generate-key-pair  
```  
```json  
{  
	"private_key": "uBS5eBttHrqkdY41kbZPdvYnNz8Vj0TvKIUpjB1y/GA=",  
	"public_key": "Ycig/Zr/pZmklmFUN99nr+taURlYItL91g+NcHGYpB8="  
}  
```

After generating the key pair, copy the public key value and enter it in the payload logging configuration.

## Troubleshooting macOS errors

If you are using macOS, the operating system may block the `matched-data-cli` tool, depending on your security settings.

For instructions on how to execute unsigned binaries like the `matched-data-cli` tool in macOS, refer to the [Safely open apps on your Mac ↗](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102445#openanyway) page in Apple Support.
