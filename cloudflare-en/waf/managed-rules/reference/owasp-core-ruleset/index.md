# Cloudflare OWASP Core Ruleset

Last updated Jun 5, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/managed-rules/reference/owasp-core-ruleset/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

The Cloudflare OWASP Core Ruleset is Cloudflare's implementation of the [OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set ↗](https://owasp.org/www-project-modsecurity-core-rule-set/) (CRS) version 3.3.0.

The Cloudflare OWASP Core Ruleset is designed to work as a single entity to calculate a [threat score](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/managed-rules/reference/owasp-core-ruleset/concepts/#request-threat-score) and execute an action based on that score. When a rule in the ruleset matches a request, the threat score increases according to the rule score. If the final threat score is greater than the configured [score threshold](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/managed-rules/reference/owasp-core-ruleset/concepts/#score-threshold), Cloudflare executes the action configured in the last rule of the ruleset.

Caution

The Cloudflare OWASP Core Ruleset is prone to false positives and offers only marginal benefits when added on top of Cloudflare Managed Ruleset and WAF attack score. If you decide to deploy this managed ruleset, you will need to monitor and adjust its settings based on your traffic to prevent false positives.

## OWASP Top 10 versus Cloudflare Rulesets

The Cloudflare OWASP Core Ruleset is Cloudflare's implementation of the OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set version 3.3.0, which is different from the [OWASP Top 10 ↗](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/).

The [OWASP Top 10 ↗](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/) is a list of the most severe application security risks, designed to raise awareness among practitioners and developers. While some risks can be addressed by a web application firewall, others require different solutions or must be mitigated during application development. Specifically:

* Cryptographic Failures
* Insecure Design
* Identification and Authentication Failures
* Security Logging and Monitoring Failures

These risks depend more on how the application is built or how the entire monitoring pipeline is set up.

### Cloudflare products versus OWASP Top 10

While both the Cloudflare Managed Ruleset and OWASP CRS aim to mitigate several categories of the OWASP Top 10, their approaches differ. OWASP CRS v3.3 is a generalized, "scoring-based" open-source ruleset that often requires manual tuning. In contrast, the Cloudflare Managed Ruleset is a proprietary, signature-heavy engine backed by Cloudflare's massive global threat intelligence. Furthermore, Cloudflare rapidly deploys protections for new CVEs through its managed ruleset, whereas the OWASP CRS remains relatively static.

The following table outlines how Cloudflare products map to the OWASP categories.

| OWASP Top 10 category          | OWASP Core Rule Set (v3.3)                                                                           | Cloudflare Managed Ruleset                                                                                                                               | Other Cloudflare products                                                                                                                                                                     |
