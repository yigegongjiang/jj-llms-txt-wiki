# Configure exposed credentials checks via API

Last updated May 5, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/managed-rules/check-for-exposed-credentials/configure-api/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Deprecation notice

Exposed credentials check has been deprecated.

Switch from exposed credentials check to [leaked credentials detection](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/detections/leaked-credentials/) for improved security. To upgrade your current configuration, refer to the [upgrade guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/managed-rules/check-for-exposed-credentials/upgrade-to-leaked-credentials-detection/).

Configure exposed credentials checks using the [Rulesets API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/rulesets-api/). You can do the following:

* [Deploy the Cloudflare Exposed Credentials Check Managed Ruleset](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/managed-rules/reference/exposed-credentials-check/#configure-via-api).
* [Create custom rules that check for exposed credentials](#create-a-custom-rule-checking-for-exposed-credentials).

If you are using Terraform, refer to [Configure exposed credentials checks using Terraform](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/managed-rules/check-for-exposed-credentials/configure-terraform/).

## Create a custom rule checking for exposed credentials

Note

This feature requires [account-level WAF configuration](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/account/), which is available to Enterprise customers with a paid add-on.

You can create rules that check for exposed credentials using the [Rulesets API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/rulesets-api/). Include these rules in a custom ruleset, which you must create at the account level, and then deploy the custom ruleset to a phase.

A rule checking for exposed credentials has a match when both the rule expression and the result from the exposed credentials check are true.

To check for exposed credentials in a custom rule, include the `exposed_credential_check` object in the rule definition. This object must have the following properties:

* `username_expression` — Expression that selects the user ID used in the credentials check. This property can have up to 1024 characters.
* `password_expression` — Expression that selects the password used in the credentials check. This property can have up to 1024 characters.

Note

These properties have additional requirements:

* Each expression must evaluate to a string.
* You can only use the [upper()](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/rules-language/functions/#upper), [lower()](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/rules-language/functions/#lower), [url\_decode()](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/rules-language/functions/#url%5Fdecode), and [lookup\_json\_string()](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/rules-language/functions/#lookup%5Fjson%5Fstring) functions, and you cannot nest these functions.

You can use the `exposed_credential_check` object in rules with one of the following actions: `rewrite`, `log`, `block`, `js_challenge` (Non-Interactive Challenge), or `challenge` (Interactive Challenge). Cloudflare recommends that you only use exposed credentials checks with the following actions: `rewrite` and `log`.

To create and deploy a custom ruleset, follow the workflow described in [Work with custom rulesets](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/custom-rulesets/).

### Example A

This `POST` request example creates a new custom ruleset with a rule that checks for exposed credentials. The rule has a match if both the rule expression and the `exposed_credential_check` result are `true`. When there is a match, the rule will log the request with exposed credentials in the Cloudflare logs.

Required API token permissions

At least one of the following [token permissions](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/reference/permissions/) is required:
* `Account WAF Write`
* `Account Rulesets Write`

```bash
curl "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/$ACCOUNT_ID/rulesets" \
	--request POST \
	--header "Authorization: Bearer $CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN" \
	--json '{
		"name": "Custom Ruleset A",
		"kind": "custom",
		"description": "This ruleset includes a rule checking for exposed credentials.",
		"rules": [
				{
						"action": "log",
						"description": "Exposed credentials check on login.php page",
						"expression": "http.request.method == \"POST\" && http.request.uri == \"/login.php\"",
						"exposed_credential_check": {
								"username_expression": "url_decode(http.request.body.form[\"username\"][0])",
								"password_expression": "url_decode(http.request.body.form[\"password\"][0])"
						}
				}
		],
		"phase": "http_request_firewall_custom"
	}'
```

The response returns the created ruleset. Note the presence of the `exposed_credential_check` object on the rule definition.

```json
{
	"result": {
		"id": "<CUSTOM_RULESET_ID>",
		"name": "Custom Ruleset A",
		"description": "This ruleset includes a rule checking for exposed credentials.",
		"kind": "custom",
		"version": "1",
		"rules": [
			{
				"id": "<CUSTOM_RULE_ID>",
				"version": "1",
				"action": "log",
				"description": "Exposed credentials check on login.php page",
				"expression": "http.request.method == \"POST\" && http.request.uri == \"/login.php\"",
				"exposed_credential_check": {
					"username_expression": "url_decode(http.request.body.form[\"username\"][0])",
					"password_expression": "url_decode(http.request.body.form[\"password\"][0])"
				},
				"last_updated": "2021-03-19T10:48:04.057775Z",
				"ref": "<CUSTOM_RULE_REF>",
				"enabled": true
			}
		],
		"last_updated": "2021-03-19T10:48:04.057775Z",
		"phase": "http_request_firewall_custom"
	},
	"success": true,
	"errors": [],
	"messages": []
}
```

The example uses the `url_decode()` function because fields in the request body (available in `http.request.body.form`) are URL-encoded when the content type is `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.

After creating the custom ruleset, deploy it to a phase so that it executes. You will need the ruleset ID to deploy the custom ruleset. For more information, refer to [Deploy a custom ruleset](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/custom-rulesets/deploy-custom-ruleset/).

### Example B

This `POST` request example creates a new custom ruleset with a rule that checks for exposed credentials in JSON responses. The rule has a match if both the rule expression and the `exposed_credential_check` result are `true`. When there is a match, the rule will add an `Exposed-Credential-Check` HTTP header to the request with value `1`.

Required API token permissions

At least one of the following [token permissions](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/reference/permissions/) is required:
* `Account WAF Write`
* `Account Rulesets Write`

```bash
curl "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/$ACCOUNT_ID/rulesets" \
	--request POST \
	--header "Authorization: Bearer $CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN" \
	--json '{
		"name": "Custom Ruleset B",
		"kind": "custom",
		"description": "This ruleset includes a rule checking for exposed credentials.",
		"rules": [
				{
						"action": "rewrite",
						"action_parameters": {
								"headers": {
										"Exposed-Credential-Check": {
												"operation": "set",
												"value": "1"
										}
								}
						},
						"description": "Exposed credentials check on login endpoint with JSON body",
						"expression": "http.request.method == \"POST\" && http.request.uri == \"/login.php\" && any(http.request.headers[\"content-type\"][*] == \"application/json\")",
						"exposed_credential_check": {
								"username_expression": "lookup_json_string(http.request.body.raw, \"username\")",
								"password_expression": "lookup_json_string(http.request.body.raw, \"password\")"
						}
				}
		],
		"phase": "http_request_firewall_custom"
	}'
```

The response returns the created ruleset. Note the presence of the following elements in the rule definition:

* The `rewrite` action.
* The `action_parameters` object configuring the HTTP header added to requests with exposed credentials.
* The `exposed_credential_check` object.

```json
{
	"result": {
		"id": "<CUSTOM_RULESET_ID>",
		"name": "Custom Ruleset B",
		"description": "This ruleset includes a rule checking for exposed credentials.",
		"kind": "custom",
		"version": "1",
		"rules": [
			{
				"id": "<CUSTOM_RULE_ID>",
				"version": "1",
				"action": "rewrite",
				"action_parameters": {
					"headers": {
						"Exposed-Credential-Check": {
							"operation": "set",
							"value": "1"
						}
					}
				},
				"description": "Exposed credentials check on login endpoint with JSON body",
				"expression": "http.request.method == \"POST\" && http.request.uri == \"/login.php\" && any(http.request.headers[\"content-type\"][*] == \"application/json\")",
				"exposed_credential_check": {
					"username_expression": "lookup_json_string(http.request.body.raw, \"username\")",
					"password_expression": "lookup_json_string(http.request.body.raw, \"password\")"
				},
				"last_updated": "2022-03-19T12:48:04.057775Z",
				"ref": "<CUSTOM_RULE_REF>",
				"enabled": true
			}
		],
		"last_updated": "2022-03-19T12:48:04.057775Z",
		"phase": "http_request_firewall_custom"
	},
	"success": true,
	"errors": [],
	"messages": []
}
```

After creating the custom ruleset, deploy it to a phase so that it executes. You will need the ruleset ID to deploy the custom ruleset. For more information, refer to [Deploy a custom ruleset](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/custom-rulesets/deploy-custom-ruleset/).
