# Configure exposed credentials checks using Terraform

Last updated May 5, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/managed-rules/check-for-exposed-credentials/configure-terraform/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Deprecation notice

Exposed credentials check has been deprecated.

Switch from exposed credentials check to [leaked credentials detection](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/detections/leaked-credentials/) for improved security. To upgrade your current configuration, refer to the [upgrade guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/managed-rules/check-for-exposed-credentials/upgrade-to-leaked-credentials-detection/).

The following Terraform configuration example addresses a common use case of exposed credentials checks.

For more information, refer to the [Terraform Cloudflare provider documentation ↗](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/cloudflare/cloudflare/latest/docs).

If you are using the Cloudflare API, refer to [Configure exposed credentials checks via API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/managed-rules/check-for-exposed-credentials/configure-api/).

## Add a custom rule to check for exposed credentials

The following configuration creates a custom ruleset with a single rule that [checks for exposed credentials](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/managed-rules/check-for-exposed-credentials/configure-api/#create-a-custom-rule-checking-for-exposed-credentials).

You can only add exposed credential checks to rules in a custom ruleset (that is, a ruleset with `kind = "custom"`).

Note

Terraform code snippets below refer to the v4 SDK only.

```tf
resource "cloudflare_ruleset" "account_firewall_custom_ruleset_exposed_creds" {
  account_id  = "<ACCOUNT_ID>"
  name        = "Custom ruleset checking for exposed credentials"
  description = ""
  kind        = "custom"
  phase       = "http_request_firewall_custom"

  rules {
    ref         = "check_for_exposed_creds_add_header"
    description = "Add header when there is a rule match and exposed credentials are detected"
    expression  = "http.request.method == \"POST\" && http.request.uri == \"/login.php\""
    action      = "rewrite"
    action_parameters {
      headers {
        name      = "Exposed-Credential-Check"
        operation = "set"
        value     = "1"
      }
    }
    exposed_credential_check {
      username_expression = "url_decode(http.request.body.form[\"username\"][0])"
      password_expression = "url_decode(http.request.body.form[\"password\"][0])"
    }
  }
}
```

To create another rule, add a new `rules` object to the same `cloudflare_ruleset` resource.

The following configuration deploys the custom ruleset. It defines a dependency on the `account_firewall_custom_ruleset_exposed_creds` resource and obtains the ID of the created custom ruleset:

Note

Terraform code snippets below refer to the v4 SDK only.

```tf
resource "cloudflare_ruleset" "account_firewall_custom_entrypoint" {
  account_id  = "<ACCOUNT_ID>"
  name        = "Account-level entry point ruleset for the http_request_firewall_custom phase deploying a custom ruleset checking for exposed credentials"
  description = ""
  kind        = "root"
  phase       = "http_request_firewall_custom"

  depends_on = [cloudflare_ruleset.account_firewall_custom_ruleset_exposed_creds]

  rules {
    ref         = "deploy_custom_ruleset_example_com"
    description = "Deploy custom ruleset for example.com"
    expression  = "(cf.zone.name eq \"example.com\")"
    action      = "execute"
    action_parameters {
      id = cloudflare_ruleset.account_firewall_custom_ruleset_exposed_creds.id
    }
  }
}
```
