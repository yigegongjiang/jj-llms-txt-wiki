# Lists API endpoints

Last updated Apr 16, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/tools/lists/lists-api/endpoints/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

To invoke a [Lists API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/rules/subresources/lists/) operation, append the endpoint to the Cloudflare API base URL:

`https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/`

For authentication instructions, refer to the Cloudflare API's [Get started](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/get-started/) page.

For help with making API calls and paginating results, refer to [Make API calls](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/how-to/make-api-calls/).

Note

The Lists API endpoints require a value for `{account_id}`.

To retrieve a list of accounts to which you have access, use the [List Accounts](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/accounts/methods/list/) operation and note the IDs of the accounts you want to manage.

The Lists API supports the operations outlined below. Visit the associated links for examples.

## Manage lists

### Create a list

* **Operation**: [Create a list](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/rules/subresources/lists/methods/create/)
* **Method and endpoint**: `POST accounts/{account_id}/rules/lists`
* **Notes**: Creates an empty list.

### Get lists

* **Operation**: [Get lists](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/rules/subresources/lists/methods/list/)
* **Method and endpoint**: `GET accounts/{account_id}/rules/lists`
* **Notes**:  
  * Fetches all lists for the account.
  * This request does not fetch the items in the lists.

### Get a list

* **Operation**: [Get a list](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/rules/subresources/lists/methods/get/)
* **Method and endpoint**: `GET accounts/{account_id}/rules/lists/{list_id}`
* **Notes**:  
  * Fetches a list by its ID.
  * This request does not display the items in the list.

### Update a list

* **Operation**: [Update a list](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/rules/subresources/lists/methods/update/)
* **Method and endpoint**: `PUT accounts/{account_id}/rules/lists/{list_id}`
* **Notes**:  
  * Updates the `description` of a list.
  * You cannot edit the `name` or `kind`, and you cannot update items in a list. To update an item in a list, use the [Update all list items](#update-all-list-items) operation.

### Delete a list

* **Operation**: [Delete a list](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/rules/subresources/lists/methods/delete/)
* **Method and endpoint**: `DELETE accounts/{account_id}/rules/lists/{list_id}`
* **Notes**: Deletes the list, but only when no [filters](https://developers.cloudflare.com/firewall/api/cf-filters/) reference it.

## Manage items in a list

Nearly all the operations for managing items in a list are asynchronous. When you add or delete a large amount of items to or from a list, there may be a delay before the bulk operation is complete.

Asynchronous list operations return an `operation_id`, which you can use to monitor the status of an API operation. To monitor the status of an asynchronous operation, use the [Get bulk operation status](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/rules/subresources/lists/subresources/bulk%5Foperations/methods/get/) endpoint and specify the ID of the operation you want to monitor.

When you make requests to a list while a bulk operation on that list is in progress, the requests are queued and processed in sequence (first in, first out). Requests for successful asynchronous operations return an `HTTP 201` status code.

### Get list items

* **Operation**: [Get list items](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/rules/subresources/lists/subresources/items/methods/list/)
* **Method and endpoint**: `GET accounts/{account_id}/rules/lists/{list_id}/items[?search={query}]`
* **Notes**:  
  * Fetches items in a list (all items, by default).
  * Items are sorted in ascending order.
  * In the case of IP lists, CIDRs are sorted by IP address, then by the subnet mask.
  * To filter returned items, use the optional `search` query string parameter. For more information, refer to the [Get list items](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/rules/subresources/lists/subresources/items/methods/list/) API operation.

### Get a list item

* **Operation**: [Get a list item](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/rules/subresources/lists/subresources/items/methods/get/)
* **Method and endpoint**: `GET accounts/{account_id}/rules/lists/{list_id}/items/{item_id}`
* **Notes**: Fetches an item from a list by ID

### Create list items

* **Operation**: [Create list items](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/rules/subresources/lists/subresources/items/methods/create/)
* **Method and endpoint**: `POST accounts/{account_id}/rules/lists/{list_id}/items`
* **Notes**:  
  * Appends a new item or items to a list.
  * Replaces entries that already exist in the list, does not delete any items.
  * Overwrites the `comment` of the original item.
  * The response includes an `operation_id`.

### Update all list items

* **Operation**: [Update all list items](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/rules/subresources/lists/subresources/items/methods/update/)
* **Method and endpoint**: `PUT accounts/{account_id}/rules/lists/{list_id}/items`
* **Notes**:  
  * Deletes all current items in the list and replaces them with `items`.
  * When `items` is empty, deletes **all** items in the list.
  * The response includes an `operation_id`.

### Delete list items

* **Operation**: [Delete list items](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/rules/subresources/lists/subresources/items/methods/delete/)
* **Method and endpoint**: `DELETE accounts/{account_id}/rules/lists/{list_id}/items`
* **Notes**:  
  * Deletes specified list items.
  * The response includes an `operation_id`.
