Last updated Apr 16, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/tools/lists/managed-lists/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Cloudflare provides Managed Lists you can use in rule expressions. These lists are regularly updated.

Note

This feature requires an Enterprise plan.

## Managed IP Lists

Use Managed IP Lists to access Cloudflare's IP threat intelligence.

Cloudflare provides the following Managed IP Lists:
