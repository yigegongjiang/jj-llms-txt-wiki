# Use lists in expressions

Last updated Apr 16, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/tools/lists/use-in-expressions/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

In the Cloudflare dashboard, there are two options for editing [expressions](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/rules-language/expressions/):

* [Expression Builder](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/rules-language/expressions/edit-expressions/#expression-builder): Allows you to create expressions using drop-down lists, emphasizing a visual approach to defining an expression.
* [Expression Editor](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/rules-language/expressions/edit-expressions/#expression-editor): A text-only interface that supports advanced features, such as grouping symbols and functions for transforming and validating values.

## Use a list in the Expression Builder

To use a list in the Expression Builder:

1. From the **Operator** drop-down list, select _is in list_ or _is not in list_. Note that not all fields support these operators.

2. Select a list from the **Value** drop-down list. Depending on your plan, you may be able to select a [Managed IP List](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/tools/lists/managed-lists/#managed-ip-lists).
3. To commit your changes and enable the rule, select **Deploy**. If you are not ready to enable the rule, select **Save as Draft**.

## Use a list in the Expression Editor

To use a list in the Expression Editor, specify the `in` operator and use `$<list_name>` to specify the name of the list.

Examples:

* Expression matching requests from IP addresses that are in an IP list named `office_network`:  
```txt  
ip.src in $office_network  
```
* Expression matching requests with a source IP address different from IP addresses in the `office_network` IP list:  
```txt  
not ip.src in $office_network  
```
* Expression matching requests from IP addresses in the Cloudflare Open Proxies [Managed IP List](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/tools/lists/managed-lists/#managed-ip-lists):  
```txt  
ip.src in $cf.open_proxies  
```
