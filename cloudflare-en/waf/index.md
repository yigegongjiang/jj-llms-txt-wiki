# Cloudflare Web Application Firewall

Last updated Aug 19, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Get automatic protection from vulnerabilities and the flexibility to create custom rules.

Available on all plans

The Cloudflare Web Application Firewall (Cloudflare WAF) checks incoming web and API requests and filters undesired traffic based on sets of rules called rulesets. The WAF uses the [Rules language](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/rules-language/), a flexible expression syntax that lets you filter traffic by request properties such as IP address, URL path, headers, and body content.

## Features

[Application Profiles](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/detections/application-profiles/)

Compare requests with an application-specific expected structure. Review profile detections before mitigating violations with Custom Rules.

Use Application Profiles

[Custom rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/custom-rules/)

Create your own custom rules to protect your website and your APIs from malicious incoming traffic. Use advanced features like [WAF attack score](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/detections/attack-score/) and [malicious uploads detection](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/detections/malicious-uploads/) in your custom rules.

Use Custom rules

[Rate limiting rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/rate-limiting-rules/)

Define rate limits for incoming requests matching an expression, and the action to take when those rate limits are reached.

Use Rate limiting rules

[Managed rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/managed-rules/)

Enable the pre-configured managed rulesets to get immediate protection. These rulesets are [regularly updated](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/change-log/), offering advanced zero-day vulnerability protections, and you can adjust their behavior.

Use Managed rules

[Account-level configuration](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/account/)

Enterprise-only

Create and deploy rulesets to multiple Enterprise zones.

Use Account-level configuration

[Security Events](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/analytics/security-events/)

Review mitigated requests (rule matches) using an intuitive interface. Tailor your security configurations based on sampled logs.
