# Configure a rule with the Skip action

Last updated Aug 3, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/custom-rules/skip/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Use the _Skip_ action in a custom rule to skip one or more security features. A rule configured with the _Skip_ action is also known as a skip rule.

Skip rules allow specific requests to bypass security features that would otherwise block or challenge them. Use skip rules when legitimate traffic matches a security rule unintentionally. For example, to allow a trusted API client through [rate limiting rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/rate-limiting-rules/), or to exempt an internal monitoring service from [Managed Rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/managed-rules/).

You can skip [rate limiting rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/rate-limiting-rules/), [Managed Rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/managed-rules/), [Super Bot Fight Mode](https://developers.cloudflare.com/bots/get-started/super-bot-fight-mode/) rules, and several other security products. However, you cannot skip [Bot Fight Mode](https://developers.cloudflare.com/bots/get-started/bot-fight-mode/) (available on the Free plan).

For more information on the available options, refer to [Available skip options](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/custom-rules/skip/options/).

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Security rules** page.  
[Go to **Security rules** ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/:zone/security/security-rules)
2. [Create a custom rule](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/custom-rules/create-dashboard/) by selecting **Create rule** \> **Custom rules**, or edit an existing custom rule.
3. Define the rule name and the rule expression.
4. Under **Choose action**, select _Skip_ from the dropdown.

5. Configure the desired [skip options](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/custom-rules/skip/options/).
6. Save your changes.

Use the [Rulesets API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/rulesets-api/) to configure custom rules via API.

Refer to [API examples](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/custom-rules/skip/api-examples/) for examples of creating skip rules.
