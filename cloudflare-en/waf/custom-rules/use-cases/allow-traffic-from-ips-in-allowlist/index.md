# Allow traffic from IP addresses in allowlist only

Last updated Apr 16, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/custom-rules/use-cases/allow-traffic-from-ips-in-allowlist/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

This example blocks incoming requests from IP addresses that are not present in an allowlist (defined using an [IP list](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/tools/lists/custom-lists/#ip-lists)).

1. [Create an IP list](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/tools/lists/create-dashboard/) with the IP addresses for which you want to allow access.  
For example, create an IP list named `allowed_ips` with one or more IP addresses. For more information on the accepted IP address formats, refer to [IP lists](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/tools/lists/custom-lists/#ip-lists).
2. [Create a custom rule](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/custom-rules/create-dashboard/) blocking any requests from IPs not present in the list you created (`allowed_ips` in the current example).

  * **When incoming requests match**:

| Field             | Operator       | Value        |
| ----------------- | -------------- | ------------ |
| IP Source Address | is not in list | allowed\_ips |  
  If you are using the expression editor:  
  `(not ip.src in $allowed_ips)`
  * **Then take action**: _Block_
3. (Optional) Update your expression with any extra filters, like blocking non-allowlisted IPs only for specific URI paths:

| Field             | Operator       | Value        | Logic |
| ----------------- | -------------- | ------------ | ----- |
| IP Source Address | is not in list | allowed\_ips | And   |
| URI Path          | wildcard       | /admin/\*    |       |  
If you are using the expression editor:  
`(not ip.src in $allowed_ips and http.request.uri.path wildcard "/admin/*")`
