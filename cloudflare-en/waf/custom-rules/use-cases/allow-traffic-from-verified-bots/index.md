# Allow traffic from search engine bots

Last updated Apr 16, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/custom-rules/use-cases/allow-traffic-from-verified-bots/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

This example [custom rule](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/custom-rules/create-dashboard/) challenges requests from a list of countries, but allows traffic from search engine bots — such as Googlebot and Bingbot — and from other [verified bots](https://developers.cloudflare.com/bots/concepts/bot/verified-bots/).

The rule expression uses the [cf.client.bot](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/rules-language/fields/reference/cf.client.bot/) field to determine if the request originated from a known good bot or crawler.

* **When incoming requests match**:

| Field      | Operator | Value                 | Logic |
| ---------- | -------- | --------------------- | ----- |
| Country    | is in    | Mexico, United States | And   |
| Known Bots | equals   | false                 |       |  
If you are using the expression editor:  
`(ip.src.country in {"US" "MX"} and not cf.client.bot)`
* **Then take action**: _Managed Challenge_
