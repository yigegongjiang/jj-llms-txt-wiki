# Issue challenge for admin user in JWT claim based on attack score

Last updated May 5, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/custom-rules/use-cases/check-jwt-claim-to-protect-admin-user/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Note

To use claims inside a JSON Web Token (JWT), you must first set up a [token validation configuration](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api-shield/security/jwt-validation/api/) in API Shield.

This example configures additional protection for requests with a JSON Web Token (JWT) with a user claim of `admin`, based on the request's [attack score](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/detections/attack-score/).

[Create a custom rule](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/custom-rules/create-dashboard/) that issues a Managed Challenge if the user claim in a JWT is `admin` and the attack score is below 40.

* **When incoming requests match**  
Use the expression editor:  
`(lookup_json_string(http.request.jwt.claims["<TOKEN_CONFIGURATION_ID>"][0], "user") eq "admin" and cf.waf.score < 40)`
* **Then take action**: _Managed Challenge_

In this example, `<TOKEN_CONFIGURATION_ID>` is your [token configuration ID](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api-shield/security/jwt-validation/api/) found in JWT Validation and `user` is the JWT claim.
