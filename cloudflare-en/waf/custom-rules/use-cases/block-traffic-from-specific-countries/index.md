This example [custom rule](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/custom-rules/create-dashboard/) blocks requests based on country code using the [ip.src.country](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/rules-language/fields/reference/ip.src.country/) field.

* **When incoming requests match**:

| Field   | Operator | Value               |
| ------- | -------- | ------------------- |
| Country | is in    | Korea, North, Syria |  
If you are using the expression editor:  
`(ip.src.country in {"KP" "SY"})`
* **Then take action**: _Block_
