# Block Microsoft Exchange Autodiscover requests

Last updated May 5, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/custom-rules/use-cases/block-ms-exchange-autodiscover/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

In some cases, Microsoft Exchange Autodiscover service requests can be "noisy", triggering large numbers of `HTTP 404` (`Not found`) errors.

This example [custom rule](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/custom-rules/create-dashboard/) blocks requests for `autodiscover.xml` and `autodiscover.src`:

* **When incoming requests match**:  
Use the expression editor:  
`(ends_with(http.request.uri.path, "/autodiscover.xml") or ends_with(http.request.uri.path, "/autodiscover.src"))`
* **Then take action**: _Block_

Alternatively, customers on a Business or Enterprise plan can use the `matches` [comparison operator](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/rules-language/operators/#comparison-operators) for the same purpose. For this example, the expression would be the following:

```txt
(http.request.uri.path matches "/autodiscover.(xml|src)$")
```
