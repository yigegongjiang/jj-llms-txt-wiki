# Block traffic by geographical location

Last updated May 5, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/custom-rules/use-cases/block-by-geographical-location/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

This example [custom rule](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/custom-rules/create-dashboard/) blocks requests by autonomous system number (ASN), continent, or country of origin.

* **When incoming requests match**:

| Field     | Operator | Value        | Logic |
| --------- | -------- | ------------ | ----- |
| AS Num    | equals   | 131279       | Or    |
| Continent | equals   | Asia         | Or    |
| Country   | equals   | Korea, North |       |  
If you are using the expression editor:  
`(ip.src.asnum eq 131279) or (ip.src.continent eq "AS") or (ip.src.country eq "KP")`
* **Then take action**: _Block_
