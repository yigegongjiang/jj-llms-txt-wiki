# Build a sequence rule within custom rules

Last updated Apr 16, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/custom-rules/use-cases/sequence-custom-rules/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

You can build an [API sequence rule](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api-shield/security/sequence-mitigation/custom-rules/) via the Cloudflare dashboard.

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Security rules** page.  
[Go to **Security rules** ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/:zone/security/security-rules)
2. To create a new empty rule, select **Create rule** \> **Custom rules**.
3. Enter a descriptive name for the rule in **Rule name**.
4. Under **When incoming requests match**, use the **Field** drop-down list to filter by **Sequences** and select from:

  * Current Operation
  * Previous Operations
  * Elapsed time
5. Under **Value**, select the edit icon to use Builder and build a sequence on the side panel.
6. Under **Select a hostname for this sequence**, choose all or a specific hostname from the dropdown list. Optionally, you can use the search bar to search for a specific hostname.
7. From the **Methods** dropdown list, choose all methods or a specific request method.
8. Select the checkbox for each endpoint in the order that you want them to appear in the sequence.
9. Set the time to complete.
10. Select **Save**.
11. Under **Then take action**, select the rule action in the **Choose action** dropdown. For example, selecting _Block_ tells Cloudflare to refuse requests that match the conditions you specified.
12. (Optional) If you selected the _Block_ action, you can configure a custom response.
13. Under **Place at**, select the order of when the rule will fire.
14. To save and deploy your rule, select **Deploy**. If you are not ready to deploy your rule, select **Save as Draft**.

Note

The fields in the custom rule are populated as a grouped sequence based on the values that you entered on Builder.
