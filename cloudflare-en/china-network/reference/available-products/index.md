## Footnotes

1. [Turnstile](https://developers.cloudflare.com/turnstile/) is not available within Mainland China. [↩](#user-content-fnref-1)
2. [Origin Rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/origin-rules/) require that China Network is enabled on both the original zone (the one visitors are accessing) and the target zone. Otherwise, visitors will receive a [1016 error](https://developers.cloudflare.com/support/troubleshooting/http-status-codes/cloudflare-1xxx-errors/error-1016/) along with an [HTTP 530 status code](https://developers.cloudflare.com/support/troubleshooting/http-status-codes/cloudflare-5xx-errors/error-530/). [↩](#user-content-fnref-2)
3. R2 buckets cannot be created within Mainland China and [custom domains](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/buckets/public-buckets/#add-your-domain-to-cloudflare) are not supported within Mainland China. However, R2 can be extended into Mainland China through [Global Acceleration](https://developers.cloudflare.com/china-network/concepts/global-acceleration/). [↩](#user-content-fnref-3)
4. Image Resizing works [within Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/images/optimization/transformations/transform-via-workers/), but may not be available [through URL format](https://developers.cloudflare.com/images/optimization/features/). [↩](#user-content-fnref-4)
