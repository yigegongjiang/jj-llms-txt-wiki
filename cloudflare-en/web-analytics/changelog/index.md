## 2026-07-13

The beacon script is now injected with `type="module"` to intentionally exclude long EOL'd (End-of-Life'd) browsers like Internet Explorer from loading the script, given they don't support it anyway. [See FAQ entry for more information](https://developers.cloudflare.com/web-analytics/faq/#why-am-i-seeing-syntax-errors-from-the-beacon-script-in-internet-explorer).

## 2022-10-17

Updated to report new metrics such as time to first byte (TTFB), interaction to next paint (INP), and first contentful paint (FCP). Additionally, it reports `navigator.webdriver`, `server-timing` header (experimental), and protocol info (`nextHopProtocol`).

## 2021-12-14

Improved site filtering.

## 2021-11-16

When using the automatic installation feature of the JavaScript Beacon (available only to customers proxied through Cloudflare - also known as orange-clouded customers), [Subresource Integrity (SRI)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Subresource%5FIntegrity) is now enabled by default. SRI is a security feature that enables browsers to verify that resources they fetch are delivered without unexpected manipulation.

## 2021-09-01

Improved to report debugging information for Core Web Vitals.

## 2021-05-28
