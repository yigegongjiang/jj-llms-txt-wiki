## 2026-08-20

Updated Google's web-vitals library to version 6.1.0\. In order to improve the accuracy of tracking soft navigations (i.e. those used by Single Page Applications), we've introduced support for [Google's new Soft Navigations API](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/web-platform/soft-navigations) available in Chromium-based browsers (e.g. Chrome, Edge, Opera) and added an improved fallback for non-Chromium browsers (e.g. Safari and Firefox) using [the Navigation API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigation%5FAPI). For more information, see [Web Analytics for SPAs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/web-analytics/get-started/web-analytics-spa/).

## 2026-07-13

The beacon script is now injected with `type="module"` to intentionally exclude long EOL'd (End-of-Life'd) browsers like Internet Explorer from loading the script, given they don't support it anyway. [See FAQ entry for more information](https://developers.cloudflare.com/web-analytics/faq/#why-am-i-seeing-syntax-errors-from-the-beacon-script-in-internet-explorer).

## 2026-06-16

Updated Google's web-vitals library to version 5.3.0 and updated the JavaScript build output target to ES2015.

## 2026-05-15

Updated Google's web-vitals library to version 4.2.4 and captured Interaction to Next Paint (INP) sub-part metrics (Input Delay, Processing Duration, Presentation Delay)

## 2024-06-11

Enhanced to include reporting of Server-Timing headers.

## 2024-05-22

Introducing new metric fields, transferSize and decodedBodySize are included.

## 2024-04-17

Introducing new metric fields, deliveryType (dt) and navigationType (nt) are included.

## 2023-07-13

## 2023-04-19

## 2023-04-06

Updated webpack configuration to output code in ECMAScript 3 (ES3) format.

## 2023-03-23

Updated Google's web-vitals library (version 3.1.1) and removed experimental `server-timing` header.

## 2022-10-17

Updated to report new metrics such as time to first byte (TTFB), interaction to next paint (INP), and first contentful paint (FCP). Additionally, it reports `navigator.webdriver`, `server-timing` header (experimental), and protocol info (`nextHopProtocol`).

## 2021-12-14

Improved site filtering.

## 2021-11-16

When using the automatic installation feature of the JavaScript Beacon (available only to customers proxied through Cloudflare - also known as orange-clouded customers), [Subresource Integrity (SRI)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Subresource%5FIntegrity) is now enabled by default. SRI is a security feature that enables browsers to verify that resources they fetch are delivered without unexpected manipulation.

## 2021-09-01

Improved to report debugging information for Core Web Vitals.

## 2021-05-28

`startsWith` function replaced with `indexOf` function, which prevents rendering if multiple beacon scripts are loaded.

## 2021-05-12

Reporting endpoint changed from `/cdn-cgi/beacon/performance` to `/cdn-cgi/rum` (for Browser Insights only).
