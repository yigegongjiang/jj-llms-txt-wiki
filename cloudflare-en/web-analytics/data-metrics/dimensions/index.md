# Dimensions

Last updated Apr 30, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/web-analytics/data-metrics/dimensions/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Dimensions are the labels used to describe different types of metrics or data. For example, **Referer** is the data collected from external links referring visits to a page, while **Browser** shows which browsers accessed your website.

Below you can find a list of the different dimensions you can use to filter Web Analytics:

* **Country**: The visitor's country.
* **Host**: The domain of the site's URL.
* **Path**: The links within your site referring visits to a page.
* **Referer**: The external links referring visits to a page. You can access `referer host` data on the dashboard. Additionally, you can access data for the `referer path` from the GraphQL API.
* **Device type**: The device visitors use to access a page (for example, desktop, mobile, or tablet).
* **Browser**: The web browser (for example, Chrome, Safari) visitors use to access your website.
* **Operating system**: The operating system visitors use to access a page.
* **Site**: The website's domain name. Used for high-level segmentation of data. For example, you can use it for a particular zone or gray-clouded website.
* **Exclude Bots**: Exclude bot traffic from the dataset. With this dimension set to `Yes`, the resulting dataset will be a closer representation of real user traffic.
* **Navigation type**: Which method was used to load the HTML document. Refer to [Navigation types](#navigation-types) for a breakdown.

| Type                    | Cache hit? | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| Navigate                | ❌          | The visitor clicked a link or submitted a form but the document was either not found or stale in the browsers HTTP cache, so a network request was made to load the document.                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Navigate Cache          | ✅          | The visitor clicked a link or submitted a form and the document was found and fresh within the browsers HTTP cache, so no network request was necessary for the document.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Navigate Prefetch Cache | ✅          | The visitor clicked a link or submitted a form and the document has been prefetched into the browsers HTTP cache, so no network request was necessary for the document.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Prerender               | ✅          | The visitor clicked a link or submitted a form but the browser had already prerendered the page, so no network request was necessary for the document.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Reload                  | ❌          | The visitor reloaded the page but the document was either not found or stale in the browsers HTTP cache, so a network request was made to load the document.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Reload Cache            | ✅          | The visitor reloaded the page and the document was found and fresh within the browsers HTTP cache, so no network request was necessary for the document.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Back-forward            | ❌          | The visitor used the back/forward buttons/gestures in their browser but the previously-loaded document either not found or stale in the browsers HTTP cache OR a feature was used which prevents using the cache (refer to the explanation in [Back/forward cache ↗](https://web.dev/articles/bfcache)), so a network request was made to load the document. |
| Back-forward Cache      | ✅          | The visitor used the back/forward buttons/gestures in their browser and the document was found and fresh within the browsers HTTP cache, so no network request was necessary for the document.                                                                                                                                                               |
| Restore                 | ✅          | The browser was able to restore this page, for example when a tab has been paused due to inactivity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
