# Billing permissions

Last updated May 4, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/billing/understand/billing-permissions/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Access to billing features in the Cloudflare dashboard depends on the role assigned to each account member. This page maps each billing action to the required role.

## Roles and billing capabilities

| Manage account members and roles   | Yes                 | No            | No      |

Note

The Billing role can view and pay but cannot change subscriptions or plans. To both manage subscriptions and handle payments, a user needs the Super Administrator role.

## Assign the Billing role

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/).
2. Select your account.
3. Go to **Manage Account** \> **Members**.
4. Select **Invite** to add a new member, or select an existing member to edit their role.
5. Assign the **Billing** role.

For more detail on account roles, refer to [Manage account members](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/manage-members/manage/).

## API access for billing

API tokens used for billing endpoints require the `Billing Read` or `Billing Edit` permission. To create an API token with billing access:

1. Go to **My Profile** \> **API Tokens**.
2. Select **Create Token**.
3. Use the **Custom token** template.
4. Under **Permissions**, select **Account** \> **Billing** \> **Read** (or **Edit**).

For full API documentation, refer to the [Cloudflare API reference ↗](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/).
