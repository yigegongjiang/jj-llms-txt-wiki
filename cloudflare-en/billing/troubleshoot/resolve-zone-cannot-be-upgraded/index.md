# Resolve the zone cannot be upgraded error

Last updated May 29, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/billing/troubleshoot/resolve-zone-cannot-be-upgraded/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

When trying to upgrade a domain or purchase a subscription, you may see an error that contains one of the following phrases:

* "this zone cannot be upgraded"
* "there is a problem with your billing profile"

## Causes

* Your account may have an outstanding unpaid balance.
* Another account previously associated with the domain or zone may have an outstanding unpaid balance.

## Solution

This message appears when the account or domain involved has an outstanding unpaid balance. For a domain, this may also be triggered by a previous account that owned the domain.

1. Check each Cloudflare account you have access to for an outstanding balance. Refer to [Email address and password](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/user-profiles/change-password-or-email/) if you have forgotten these details.
2. To pay the balance, refer to [Pay an outstanding balance](https://developers.cloudflare.com/billing/manage/pay-invoices-overdue-balances/#pay-an-outstanding-balance).
3. Wait 24 hours after paying this balance.
4. Attempt the upgrade again.

As a reference, the full error messages you may see are:

* "Due to a Billing related issue, the zone cannot be upgraded at this time. Please visit the Billing section to ensure there is no outstanding balance."
* "Refer to [https://cfl.re/3VUQyyL ↗](https://cfl.re/3VUQyyL) for assistance. For security reasons, there is a problem with your billing profile."

## Verify the fix

After you pay the outstanding balance and wait 24 hours, return to the domain or subscription you were trying to purchase and retry the upgrade.
