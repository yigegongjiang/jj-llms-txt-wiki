# Getting started

Last updated May 27, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/sandbox/get-started/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Build your first application with Sandbox SDK - a secure code execution environment. In this guide, you'll create a Worker that can execute Python code and work with files in isolated containers.

What you're building

A simple API that can safely execute Python code and perform file operations in isolated sandbox environments.

## Prerequisites

1. Sign up for a [Cloudflare account ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up/workers-and-pages).
2. Install [Node.js ↗](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).

Node.js version manager

Use a Node version manager like [Volta ↗](https://volta.sh/) or [nvm ↗](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to avoid permission issues and change Node.js versions. [Wrangler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/), discussed later in this guide, requires a Node version of `16.17.0` or later.

### Ensure Docker is running locally

Sandbox SDK uses [Docker ↗](https://www.docker.com/) to build container images alongside your Worker.

You must have Docker running locally when you run `wrangler deploy`. For most people, the best way to install Docker is to follow the [docs for installing Docker Desktop ↗](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/). Other tools like [Colima ↗](https://github.com/abiosoft/colima) may also work.

You can check that Docker is running properly by running the `docker info` command in your terminal. If Docker is running, the command will succeed. If Docker is not running, the `docker info` command will hang or return an error including the message "Cannot connect to the Docker daemon".

## 1\. Create a new project

Create a new Sandbox SDK project:

npmyarnpnpm

```
npm create cloudflare@latest -- my-sandbox --template=cloudflare/sandbox-sdk/examples/minimal
```

```
yarn create cloudflare my-sandbox --template=cloudflare/sandbox-sdk/examples/minimal
```

```
pnpm create cloudflare@latest my-sandbox --template=cloudflare/sandbox-sdk/examples/minimal
```

This creates a `my-sandbox` directory with everything you need:

* `src/index.ts` \- Worker with sandbox integration
* `wrangler.jsonc` \- Configuration for Workers and Containers
* `Dockerfile` \- Container environment definition

```sh
cd my-sandbox
```

## 2\. Explore the template

The template provides a minimal Worker that demonstrates core sandbox capabilities:

```typescript
import { getSandbox, proxyToSandbox, type Sandbox } from "@cloudflare/sandbox";

export { Sandbox } from "@cloudflare/sandbox";

type Env = {
	Sandbox: DurableObjectNamespace<Sandbox>;
};

export default {
	async fetch(request: Request, env: Env): Promise<Response> {
		const url = new URL(request.url);

		// Get or create a sandbox instance. For user-facing apps,
		// derive this ID from the authenticated user.
		const sandbox = getSandbox(env.Sandbox, "my-sandbox");

		// Execute Python code
		if (url.pathname === "/run") {
			const result = await sandbox.exec('python3 -c "print(2 + 2)"');
			return Response.json({
				output: result.stdout,
				error: result.stderr,
				exitCode: result.exitCode,
				success: result.success,
			});
		}

		// Work with files
		if (url.pathname === "/file") {
			await sandbox.writeFile("/workspace/hello.txt", "Hello, Sandbox!");
			const file = await sandbox.readFile("/workspace/hello.txt");
			return Response.json({
				content: file.content,
			});
		}

		return new Response("Try /run or /file");
	},
};
```

**Key concepts**:

* `getSandbox()` \- Gets or creates a sandbox instance by ID. Use a stable ID to reconnect to the same sandbox. In user-facing apps, scope IDs to a single user.
* `sandbox.exec()` \- Execute shell commands in the sandbox and capture stdout, stderr, and exit codes.
* `sandbox.writeFile()` / `readFile()` \- Write and read files in the sandbox filesystem.

## 3\. Test locally

Start the development server:

```sh
npm run dev
# If you expect to have multiple sandbox instances, you can increase `max_instances`.
```

Note

First run builds the Docker container (2-3 minutes). Subsequent runs are much faster due to caching.

Test the endpoints:

```sh
# Execute Python code
curl http://localhost:8787/run

# File operations
curl http://localhost:8787/file
```

You should see JSON responses with the command output and file contents.

## 4\. Deploy to production

Deploy your Worker and container:

```sh
npx wrangler deploy
```

This will:

1. Build your container image using Docker
2. Push it to Cloudflare's Container Registry
3. Deploy your Worker globally

Wait for provisioning

After first deployment, wait 2-3 minutes before making requests. The Worker deploys immediately, but the container needs time to provision.

Check deployment status:

```sh
npx wrangler containers list
```

## 5\. Test your deployment

Visit your Worker URL (shown in deploy output):

```sh
# Replace with your actual URL
curl https://my-sandbox.YOUR_SUBDOMAIN.workers.dev/run
```

Your sandbox is now deployed and can execute code in isolated containers.

## Understanding the configuration

Your `wrangler.jsonc` connects three pieces together:

```jsonc
{
	"containers": [
		{
			"class_name": "Sandbox",
			"image": "./Dockerfile",
			"instance_type": "lite",
			"max_instances": 1,
		},
	],
	"durable_objects": {
		"bindings": [
			{
				"class_name": "Sandbox",
				"name": "Sandbox",
			},
		],
	},
	"migrations": [
		{
			"new_sqlite_classes": ["Sandbox"],
			"tag": "v1",
		},
	],
}
```

```toml
[[containers]]
class_name = "Sandbox"
image = "./Dockerfile"
instance_type = "lite"
max_instances = 1

[[durable_objects.bindings]]
class_name = "Sandbox"
name = "Sandbox"

[[migrations]]
new_sqlite_classes = [ "Sandbox" ]
tag = "v1"
```

* **containers** \- Defines the [container image, instance type, and resource limits](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/#containers) for your sandbox environment. If you expect to have multiple sandbox instances, you can increase `max_instances`.
* **durable\_objects** \- You need not be familiar with [Durable Objects](https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects) to use Sandbox SDK, but if you'd like, you can [learn more about Cloudflare Containers and Durable Objects](https://developers.cloudflare.com/containers/get-started/#each-container-is-backed-by-its-own-durable-object). This configuration creates a [binding](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/bindings#what-is-a-binding) that makes the `Sandbox` Durable Object accessible in your Worker code.
* **migrations** \- Registers the `Sandbox` class, implemented by the Sandbox SDK, with [SQLite storage backend](https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/best-practices/access-durable-objects-storage) (required once)

For detailed configuration options including environment variables, secrets, and custom images, see the [Wrangler configuration reference](https://developers.cloudflare.com/sandbox/configuration/wrangler/).
