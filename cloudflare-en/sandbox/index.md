Build secure, isolated code execution environments

Available on Workers Paid plan

Sandbox SDK 1.0 preview

These pages document the current stable `@cloudflare/sandbox` package. The next major release is **Sandbox SDK 1.0**, available as a preview on `@cloudflare/sandbox@next`.

We recommend starting new projects on the preview, and migrating existing apps when you can, so you are ready when 1.0 becomes the stable release. Refer to the [1.0 preview](https://developers.cloudflare.com/sandbox/1-0-preview/) section for install, concepts, API reference, and migration.

The Sandbox SDK enables you to run untrusted code securely in isolated environments. Built on [Containers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/containers/), Sandbox SDK provides a simple API for executing commands, managing files, running background processes, and exposing services — all from your [Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/) applications.

Sandboxes are ideal for building AI agents that need to execute code, interactive development environments, data analysis platforms, CI/CD systems, and any application that needs secure code execution at the edge. Each sandbox runs in its own isolated container with a full Linux environment, providing strong security boundaries while maintaining performance.

With Sandbox, you can execute Python scripts, run Node.js applications, analyze data, compile code, and perform complex computations — all with a simple TypeScript API and no infrastructure to manage.

```typescript
import { getSandbox } from '@cloudflare/sandbox';

export { Sandbox } from '@cloudflare/sandbox';

export default {
	async fetch(request: Request, env: Env): Promise<Response> {
		const sandbox = getSandbox(env.Sandbox, 'user-123');

		// Execute a command and get the result
		const result = await sandbox.exec('python --version');

		return Response.json({
			output: result.stdout,
			exitCode: result.exitCode,
			success: result.success
		});
	}
};
```

```typescript
import { getSandbox } from '@cloudflare/sandbox';

export { Sandbox } from '@cloudflare/sandbox';

export default {
	async fetch(request: Request, env: Env): Promise<Response> {
		const sandbox = getSandbox(env.Sandbox, 'user-123');

		// Create a Python execution context
		const ctx = await sandbox.createCodeContext({ language: 'python' });

		// Execute Python code with automatic result capture
		const result = await sandbox.runCode(`
import pandas as pd
data = {'product': ['A', 'B', 'C'], 'sales': [100, 200, 150]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
df['sales'].sum()  # Last expression is automatically returned
	`, { context: ctx });

			return Response.json({
				result: result.results?.[0]?.text,
				logs: result.logs
			});
		}
	};
```

```typescript
import { getSandbox } from '@cloudflare/sandbox';

export { Sandbox } from '@cloudflare/sandbox';

export default {
	async fetch(request: Request, env: Env): Promise<Response> {
		const sandbox = getSandbox(env.Sandbox, 'user-123');

		// Create a project structure
		await sandbox.mkdir('/workspace/project/src', { recursive: true });

		// Write files
		await sandbox.writeFile(
			'/workspace/project/package.json',
			JSON.stringify({ name: 'my-app', version: '1.0.0' })
		);

		// Read a file back
		const content = await sandbox.readFile('/workspace/project/package.json');

		return Response.json({ content });
	}
};
```

```typescript
import { getSandbox } from '@cloudflare/sandbox';

export { Sandbox } from '@cloudflare/sandbox';

export default {
	async fetch(request: Request, env: Env): Promise<Response> {
		const sandbox = getSandbox(env.Sandbox, 'user-123');

		// Watch for file changes in real-time
		const watcher = await sandbox.watch('/workspace/src', {
			include: ['*.js', '*.ts'],
			onEvent: (event) => {
				console.log(`${event.type}: ${event.path}`);
				if (event.type === 'modify') {
					// Trigger rebuild or hot reload
					console.log('Code changed, recompiling...');
				}
			},
			onError: (error) => {
				console.error('Watch error:', error);
			}
		});

		// Stop watching when done
		setTimeout(() => watcher.stop(), 60000);

		return Response.json({ message: 'File watcher started' });
	}
};
```

```typescript
import { getSandbox } from '@cloudflare/sandbox';

export { Sandbox } from '@cloudflare/sandbox';

export default {
	async fetch(request: Request, env: Env): Promise<Response> {
		const url = new URL(request.url);

		// Terminal WebSocket connection
		if (url.pathname === '/ws/terminal') {
			const sandbox = getSandbox(env.Sandbox, 'user-123');
			return sandbox.terminal(request, { cols: 80, rows: 24 });
		}

		return Response.json({ message: 'Terminal endpoint' });
	}
};
```

```typescript
import { getSandbox } from '@cloudflare/sandbox';

export { Sandbox } from '@cloudflare/sandbox';

export default {
	async fetch(request: Request, env: Env): Promise<Response> {
		// Connect to WebSocket services in sandbox
		if (request.headers.get('Upgrade')?.toLowerCase() === 'websocket') {
			const sandbox = getSandbox(env.Sandbox, 'user-123');
			return await sandbox.wsConnect(request, 8080);
		}

		return Response.json({ message: 'WebSocket endpoint' });
	}
};
```
