# Backups

Last updated Sep 1, 2026|Copy as Markdown| [View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/sandbox/api/backups/index.md)| [Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Create point-in-time snapshots of sandbox directories and restore them from R2.

For setup, restore workflows, and generated-cache exclusions, refer to [Backup and restore](https://developers.cloudflare.com/sandbox/guides/backup-restore/). For overlay semantics, refer to [Directory backups](https://developers.cloudflare.com/sandbox/concepts/backup-restore/).

## Methods

### `createBackup()`

Create a snapshot of a directory and upload it to R2.

```ts
await sandbox.createBackup(options: BackupOptions): Promise<DirectoryBackup>
```

**Parameters**:

- `options` - Backup configuration (see [`BackupOptions`](#backupoptions)):
  - `dir` (required) - Absolute path to back up. Must be under `/workspace`, `/home`, `/tmp`, `/var/tmp`, or `/app`.
  - `name` (optional) - Human-readable name. Maximum 256 characters. Control characters are rejected.
  - `ttl` (optional) - Time-to-live in seconds. Default: `259200` (3 days). Must be a positive number.
  - `gitignore` (optional) - When `true`, exclude paths matching `.gitignore` rules if `dir` is inside a git repository. Default: `false`. If the directory is not in a git repository, no git exclusions apply. If `git` is not installed, the SDK logs a warning and continues without git-based exclusions.
  - `excludes` (optional) - Glob patterns to omit from the archive. Passed to `mksquashfs` as wildcard excludes. `**` globstars are normalized automatically. Default: `[]`.
  - `localBucket` (optional) - When `true`, use the `BACKUP_BUCKET` R2 binding instead of presigned URLs. Intended for `wrangler dev`. Default: `false`.
  - `compression` (optional) - Archive compression. Default format: `lz4`. Default threads: `8`. Format must be `gzip`, `lz4`, or `zstd`. `threads` must be a positive integer.
  - `multipart` (optional) - Use parallel multipart upload for large archives. Default: `true`.

**Returns**: `Promise<DirectoryBackup>` containing:

- `id` - Unique backup identifier (UUID)
- `dir` - Directory that was backed up
- `localBucket` (optional) - Whether the backup used local R2 binding mode

```js
import { getSandbox } from "@cloudflare/sandbox";

const sandbox = getSandbox(env.Sandbox, "my-sandbox");

const backup = await sandbox.createBackup({ dir: "/workspace" });
await sandbox.restoreBackup(backup);
```

```ts
import { getSandbox } from "@cloudflare/sandbox";

const sandbox = getSandbox(env.Sandbox, "my-sandbox");

const backup = await sandbox.createBackup({ dir: "/workspace" });
await sandbox.restoreBackup(backup);
```

**How it works**:

In production:

1. The container creates a compressed squashfs archive.
2. The container uploads the archive to R2 with a presigned URL.
3. Metadata is stored alongside the archive in R2.
4. The local archive is deleted.

With `localBucket: true`:

1. The container creates a compressed squashfs archive.
2. The archive is uploaded through the `BACKUP_BUCKET` R2 binding.
3. Metadata is stored alongside the archive in R2.
4. The local archive is deleted.

**Throws**:

- `InvalidBackupConfigError` - If `dir` is not an allowed absolute path, the `BACKUP_BUCKET` binding is missing, or (in production) R2 presigned URL credentials are not configured
- `BackupCreateError` - If archive creation or the upload to R2 fails

R2 binding required

Configure a `BACKUP_BUCKET` R2 binding in `wrangler.jsonc` before using backup methods. Production also requires `R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`, and `BACKUP_BUCKET_NAME`. Refer to [Backup and restore](https://developers.cloudflare.com/sandbox/guides/backup-restore/#prerequisites).

Path permissions

`mksquashfs` must read every file and subdirectory in `dir`. Restrictive permissions fail with `BackupCreateError`. Refer to [Fix path permissions](https://developers.cloudflare.com/sandbox/guides/backup-restore/#fix-path-permissions).

Partial writes

Partially written files may not be captured consistently. Completed writes are included.

### `restoreBackup()`

Restore a previously created backup.

```ts
await sandbox.restoreBackup(backup: DirectoryBackup): Promise<RestoreBackupResult>
```

**Parameters**:

- `backup` - Handle returned by `createBackup()`. Contains `id` and `dir`. Restore writes into `backup.dir`, which may differ from the original backup path. (see [`DirectoryBackup`](#directorybackup))

**Returns**: `Promise<RestoreBackupResult>` containing:

- `success` - Whether the restore succeeded
- `dir` - Directory that was restored
- `id` - Backup ID that was restored

```js
await sandbox.restoreBackup(backup);
```

```ts
await sandbox.restoreBackup(backup);
```

**How it works**:

In production:

1. Metadata is downloaded from R2 and the TTL is checked, with a 60-second buffer. An expired backup throws.
2. The container downloads the archive from R2 with a presigned URL.
3. The container mounts the archive with FUSE overlayfs.

With `localBucket: true`:

1. Metadata is downloaded from the `BACKUP_BUCKET` binding and the TTL is checked.
2. The archive is downloaded from the R2 binding.
3. The archive is extracted with `unsquashfs`.

**Throws**:

- `InvalidBackupConfigError` - If `backup.id` is missing or not a UUID, or `backup.dir` is invalid
- `BackupNotFoundError` - If the metadata or archive is not in R2
- `BackupExpiredError` - If the TTL has elapsed
- `BackupRestoreError` - If the container fails to restore

Copy-on-write

In production, the backup is a read-only lower layer and new writes go to a writable upper layer. In local development, the directory is replaced. For overlay constraints, refer to [Directory backups](https://developers.cloudflare.com/sandbox/concepts/backup-restore/).

Ephemeral mount

In production, the FUSE mount is lost when the sandbox sleeps or restarts. Restore again from the handle. Stop processes that write to the target directory before restoring.

## Behavior

- Concurrent backup and restore operations on the same sandbox are serialized.
- `DirectoryBackup` is serializable. Store it in KV, D1, or Durable Object storage.
- Overlapping backups are independent. Restoring a parent directory overwrites subdirectory mounts. Restore the parent first when restoring both.
- `ttl` is enforced at restore time only. Expired objects remain in R2 until you delete them or an [R2 lifecycle rule](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/buckets/object-lifecycles/) removes them.
- Backup objects use `backups/{id}/data.sqsh` and `backups/{id}/meta.json`.

## Types

### `BackupOptions`

```ts
interface BackupCompressionOptions {
	format?: "gzip" | "lz4" | "zstd";
	threads?: number;
}

	gitignore?: boolean;
	excludes?: string[];
	localBucket?: boolean;
	compression?: BackupCompressionOptions;
	multipart?: boolean;
}
```

- `gitignore` (optional) - When `true`, exclude `.gitignore` matches if `dir` is inside a git repository. Default: `false`.
- `excludes` (optional) - Glob patterns to omit. Example: `['node_modules/.cache', '*.log']`. Refer to [Exclude generated caches](https://developers.cloudflare.com/sandbox/guides/backup-restore/#exclude-generated-caches).
- `localBucket` (optional) - Use the `BACKUP_BUCKET` binding instead of presigned URLs. Default: `false`.
