# Cloudflare WAN

Last updated Apr 21, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-wan/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Connect and secure your entire corporate network through Cloudflare, replacing MPLS circuits and hub-and-spoke routing with cloud-native networking.

Enterprise-only

Cloudflare WAN (formerly Magic WAN) connects your data centers, offices, and cloud resources through Cloudflare's global network. Instead of backhauling traffic through a central data center or maintaining dedicated MPLS circuits at every site, your traffic routes through the nearest Cloudflare data center where security policies apply inline.

Cloudflare WAN provides secure, performant [routing ↗](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-routing/) for your entire corporate network. [Cloudflare Network Firewall](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-network-firewall/) integrates with Cloudflare WAN, enabling you to enforce network firewall policies at Cloudflare's global network, across traffic from any entity within your network.

You connect your sites to Cloudflare through on-ramps — tunnels or direct connections from your network to Cloudflare. Cloudflare WAN supports any device that uses anycastGRE or IPsec tunnels. To make it easier to onboard your cloud resources, you can use [Multi-Cloud Networking](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-wan/configuration/multi-cloud-networking/), which automates creating on-ramps from your cloud networks. Refer to [On-ramps](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-wan/on-ramps/) for a full list of supported on-ramps.

## Cloudflare WAN and Cloudflare One

Cloudflare WAN is a standalone WAN-as-a-Service (WANaaS) product. It provides site-to-site connectivity over Cloudflare's global network, with packet-level security through [Cloudflare Network Firewall](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-network-firewall/). Cloudflare WAN supports IPsec tunnels, GRE tunnels, [Cloudflare Network Interconnect](https://developers.cloudflare.com/network-interconnect/), and the [Cloudflare One Appliance](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-wan/configuration/appliance/) for connecting your sites.

[Cloudflare One](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/) is the full SASE (Secure Access Service Edge) platform. It extends Cloudflare WAN with identity-aware security services:

* **[Cloudflare One Client (WARP)](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/cloudflare-one-client/)** — deploys on user devices to route traffic through Cloudflare with identity context.
* **[Cloudflare Tunnel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-tunnel/)** — creates outbound-only connections from your infrastructure to Cloudflare, with no inbound ports required.
* **[Cloudflare Gateway](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/traffic-policies/)** — applies secure web gateway (SWG) policies to filter and inspect Internet-bound traffic.
* **[Cloudflare Access](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/access-controls/)** — enforces Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) policies based on user identity, device posture, and context.

If your requirements are limited to site-to-site connectivity and network-layer security, Cloudflare WAN provides what you need. When you need user-level security policies, identity-based access controls, or secure Internet egress, you can add Cloudflare One capabilities to your existing deployment.

Cloudflare One builds on the same network infrastructure as Cloudflare WAN, so there is no migration required.

For more information about Cloudflare One, refer to the [Cloudflare One documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/).

## Features

[Connect your network automatically](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-wan/configuration/appliance/)

Use Cloudflare One Appliance to automatically connect and steer any IP traffic.

Use Cloudflare One Appliance

[Connect your network manually](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-wan/configuration/third-party/)

Set up Cloudflare WAN with your existing routers and firewalls. If you do not have Cloudflare One Appliance, start here to configure IPsec or GRE tunnels from a third-party device.

Use a third-party device

[Automatic cloud on-ramps](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-wan/configuration/multi-cloud-networking/)

Automate resource discovery, and reduce management burden when connecting to your public cloud.

Automate your cloud on-ramps

[Zero Trust integration](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-wan/zero-trust/)

Learn how you can use Cloudflare WAN with other Cloudflare Zero Trust products.

Integrate with other Zero Trust products

[BGP peering (beta)](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-wan/configuration/how-to/configure-routes/#configure-bgp-routes)

Use Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) peering between your networks and Cloudflare to automatically announce and withdraw routes as your network changes, rather than managing static routes manually.

Use BGP peering (beta)

[WAN transformation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-wan/wan-transformation/)

Replace MPLS circuits and hub-and-spoke routing with cloud-native networking. Compare WAN approaches and plan an incremental migration.

Plan your migration

[Virtual networks](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-wan/reference/virtual-networks/)

Understand how virtual networks provide routing isolation within your Cloudflare account, keeping traffic separated between environments, partners, or applications.
