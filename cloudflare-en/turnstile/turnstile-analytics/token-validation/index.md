# Token validation

Last updated May 5, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/turnstile/turnstile-analytics/token-validation/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

After a visitor successfully completes a Turnstile challenge, a token is generated and validated via the Siteverify API. Token validation data shows how many tokens your server validated successfully versus how many failed. A high rate of invalid tokens may indicate bot activity, expired tokens, or implementation issues.

For example, the token validation values in your analytics may look like this:

## Metrics

* **Siteverify requests**: The total number of requests made to the Siteverify API in the given timeframe.
* **Valid tokens**: The number of Siteverify requests with `success:true` responses.
* **Invalid tokens**: The number of Siteverify requests with `success:false` responses.

### Call Siteverify

It is important to [call the Siteverify API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/turnstile/get-started/server-side-validation/). Without calling Siteverify API to validate the tokens, your website or application is not protected. Skipping token validation means you cannot confirm the visitor's legitimacy.

* Tokens can only be redeemed once. Even valid tokens will return `success:false` if they are reused, preventing token theft and replay attacks.
* Tokens expire after five minutes. Validation must occur within this window to be effective.
* Tokens can be invalid. Bots might complete challenges, but Cloudflare can detect bot-like signals and mark the token as invalid.
