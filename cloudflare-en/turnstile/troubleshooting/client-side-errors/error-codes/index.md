## Troubleshooting

You can troubleshoot these error codes using the following recommendations:

1. Verify your browser compatibility.  
  * Turnstile supports all major browsers, except Internet Explorer.
  * Ensure your browser is up to date. For more information, refer to our [Supported browsers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-challenges/reference/supported-browsers/).
  * Run a test on the [compatibility checking tool ↗](https://debug.challenges.cloudflare.com/).
2. Disable your browser extensions.  
  * Some browser extensions, such as ad blockers, may block the scripts Turnstile needs to operate.
  * Temporarily disable all extensions and reload the page.
3. Enable JavaScript.  
  * Turnstile requires JavaScript to run. Ensure it is enabled in your browser settings. Refer to your browser's documentation for instructions on enabling JavaScript.
4. Try Incognito or Private mode.  
  * Use your browser's incognito or private mode to rule out issues caused by extensions or cached data.
5. Test another browser or device.  
  * Switch to a different browser or device to see if the issue is specific to your current setup.
6. Avoid VPNs or proxies.  
  * Some virtual private networks (VPN) or proxies may interfere with Turnstile. Disable them temporarily to test.
7. Switch to a different network.  
  * Your current network may have restrictions causing Turnstile challenges to fail. Try switching to another network, such as a mobile hotspot.

:::caution\[Error code `401`\]

Turnstile may occasionally generate a `401` Unauthorized error in your browser console during a security check. This is not typically a problem with your implementation. This error often occurs when the widget attempts to request a [Private Access Token](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-challenges/reference/private-access-tokens/) that your device or browser does not support yet.

You can generally safely ignore the `401` error, as it is an expected part of Turnstile's underlying Challenge Platform workflow. If the widget is successfully resolving and you are receiving a token, no action is required.
