# Content Security Policy

Last updated May 5, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/turnstile/reference/content-security-policy/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

If your website uses a [Content Security Policy (CSP) ↗](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP) header, you must configure it to allow Turnstile's scripts and iframes. Without the correct CSP directives, Turnstile may fail to load.

Cloudflare recommends using the nonce-based approach documented with [CSP3 ↗](https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-csp/#framework-directive-source-list). Include your nonce in the `api.js` script tag and Turnstile will propagate it to dynamically loaded resources. Turnstile works with [strict-dynamic ↗](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy#strict-dynamic).

Alternatively, add the following values to your CSP header:

* **script-src**: `https://challenges.cloudflare.com`
* **frame-src**: `https://challenges.cloudflare.com`

We recommend validating your CSP with [Google's CSP Evaluator ↗](https://csp-evaluator.withgoogle.com/).

Note

You cannot set your own CSP and/or Referer-Policy via meta tags or [Transform rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/transform/) in challenge pages.

## Pre-clearance support

If you are using [Turnstile in pre-clearance mode](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-challenges/concepts/clearance/#pre-clearance-support-in-turnstile), Turnstile sets the `cf_clearance` cookie by doing a fetch request to a special endpoint in [/cdn-cgi/](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/reference/cdn-cgi-endpoint/) of your domain.

For this request to succeed, your `connect-src` directive must include `'self'`.
