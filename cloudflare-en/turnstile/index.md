# Cloudflare Turnstile

Last updated Aug 14, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/turnstile/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Cloudflare's smart CAPTCHA alternative.

Turnstile can be embedded into any website without sending traffic through Cloudflare and works without showing visitors a CAPTCHA.

Cloudflare issues challenges through the [Challenge Platform](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-challenges/), which is the same underlying technology powering [Turnstile](https://developers.cloudflare.com/turnstile/).

In contrast to our Challenge page offerings, Turnstile allows you to run challenges anywhere on your site in a less-intrusive way without requiring the use of Cloudflare's CDN.

## How Turnstile works

![Turnstile Overview](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/image/onerror=redirect,width=3757,height=2700,format=webp/_astro/turnstile-overview.BlA8uXVD.png) 

Turnstile adapts the challenge outcome to the individual visitor or browser. First, we run a series of small non-interactive JavaScript challenges to gather signals about the visitor or browser environment.

These challenges include proof-of-work (computational puzzles), proof-of-space, probing for web APIs, and various other challenges for detecting browser-quirks and human behavior. As a result, we can fine-tune the difficulty of the challenge to the specific request and avoid showing a visual or interactive puzzle to a user.

Turnstile performs client-side security challenges on behalf of the website operator to distinguish human visitors from automated traffic. To do so, Turnstile processes only the data strictly necessary to provide this security function. Turnstile does not access, store, or transmit user communications, form entries, or other page inputs.

Note

For detailed information on Turnstile's data privacy practices, refer to the [Turnstile Privacy Addendum ↗](https://www.cloudflare.com/turnstile-privacy-policy/).

### Widget types

Turnstile [widget types](https://developers.cloudflare.com/turnstile/concepts/widget/) include:

* **Managed** (recommended): Automatically decides whether to show a checkbox based on visitor risk level.
* **Non-interactive**: Visitors never need to interact with the widget.
* **Invisible**: The widget is completely hidden from the visitor.
