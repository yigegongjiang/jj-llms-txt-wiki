# Cloudflare Turnstile

Last updated May 20, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/turnstile/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Cloudflare's smart CAPTCHA alternative.

Turnstile can be embedded into any website without sending traffic through Cloudflare and works without showing visitors a CAPTCHA.

Cloudflare issues challenges through the [Challenge Platform](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-challenges/), which is the same underlying technology powering [Turnstile](https://developers.cloudflare.com/turnstile/).

In contrast to our Challenge page offerings, Turnstile allows you to run challenges anywhere on your site in a less-intrusive way without requiring the use of Cloudflare's CDN.

## How Turnstile works

![Turnstile Overview](https://developers.cloudflare.com/_astro/turnstile-overview.BlA8uXVD_2tsm0o.webp) 

Turnstile adapts the challenge outcome to the individual visitor or browser. First, we run a series of small non-interactive JavaScript challenges to gather signals about the visitor or browser environment.

These challenges include proof-of-work (computational puzzles), proof-of-space, probing for web APIs, and various other challenges for detecting browser-quirks and human behavior. As a result, we can fine-tune the difficulty of the challenge to the specific request and avoid showing a visual or interactive puzzle to a user.

Note

For detailed information on Turnstile's data privacy practices, refer to the [Turnstile Privacy Addendum ↗](https://www.cloudflare.com/turnstile-privacy-policy/).

### Widget types

Turnstile [widget types](https://developers.cloudflare.com/turnstile/concepts/widget/) include:

* **Managed** (recommended): Automatically decides whether to show a checkbox based on visitor risk level.
* **Non-interactive**: Visitors never need to interact with the widget.
* **Invisible**: The widget is completely hidden from the visitor.
