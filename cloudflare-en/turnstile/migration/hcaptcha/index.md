# Migrate from hCaptcha

Last updated May 5, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/turnstile/migration/hcaptcha/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

If you are using hCaptcha today, you can switch seamlessly to Cloudflare Turnstile by following the step-by-step guide below to assist with the upgrade process.

To complete the migration, you must obtain the [sitekey and secret key](https://developers.cloudflare.com/turnstile/get-started/widget-management/).

## Client-side integration

1. Update the client-side integration by inserting the Turnstile script snippet in your HTML's `<head>` element:  
```html  
<script src="https://challenges.cloudflare.com/turnstile/v0/api.js" async defer></script>  
```
2. Locate the `hcaptcha.render()` calls and replace the sitekey with your Turnstile sitekey and the API.  
```js  
  // before  
  hcaptcha.render(element, {  
      sitekey: "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"  
  })  
  // after  
  turnstile.render(element, {  
      sitekey: "1x00000000000000000000AA"  
  })  
```

Note

Turnstile supports:

* the `render()` call
* hCaptcha invisible mode with the `execute()` call

## Server-side integration

1. Update the server-side integration by replacing the Siteverify URL.  
Replace: `https://hcaptcha.com/siteverify` with the following:  
```txt  
https://challenges.cloudflare.com/turnstile/v0/siteverify  
```
2. Replace the `h-captcha-response` input name with the following:  
```txt  
cf-turnstile-response  
```
