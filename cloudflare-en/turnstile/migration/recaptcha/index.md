# Migrate from reCAPTCHA

Last updated May 5, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/turnstile/migration/recaptcha/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

If you are using reCAPTCHA today, you can switch seamlessly to Cloudflare Turnstile by following the step-by-step guide below to assist with the upgrade process.

To complete the migration, you must obtain the [sitekey and secret key](https://developers.cloudflare.com/turnstile/get-started/widget-management/).

Note

Turnstile migration is currently compatible up to reCAPTCHA v2.

## Client-side integration

1. Update the client-side integration by inserting the Turnstile script snippet in your HTML's `<head>` element.  
```html  
<script  
	src="https://challenges.cloudflare.com/turnstile/v0/api.js?compat=recaptcha"  
	async  
	defer  
></script>  
```  
Note  
Adding `?compat=recaptcha` runs Turnstile in compatibility mode, which enables the following features:

  * implicit rendering for reCAPTCHA
  * `g-recaptcha-response` input name for forms
  * register the Turnstile API as `grecaptcha`
2. Locate the `grecaptcha.render()` calls and replace the sitekey with your Turnstile sitekey.  
Note  
Turnstile supports:

  * the `render()` call
  * reCAPTCHA v2 invisible mode with the `execute()` call

## Server-side integration

Update the server-side integration by replacing the Siteverify URL.

Replace `https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api/siteverify` with the following:

```txt
https://challenges.cloudflare.com/turnstile/v0/siteverify
```

Differences to reCAPTCHA's Siteverify

reCAPTCHA supports `GET` requests using query parameters, such as `GET /siteverify?response=<response>&secret=<secret>`.

Turnstile's Siteverify endpoint does _not_ support this and only accepts `POST` requests with a FormData or JSON body.

Refer to [server-side validation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/turnstile/get-started/server-side-validation/) for more information.
