# Remove Cloudflare branding with Offlabel

Last updated May 20, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/turnstile/additional-configuration/offlabel/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Offlabel is an Enterprise-only feature that removes Cloudflare branding and logo from Turnstile widgets. When enabled, widgets display without any visual references to Cloudflare.

When Offlabel is enabled:

* The Cloudflare logo and color schemes are removed from all widget states.
* The widget maintains the same functionality, behavior, and WCAG 2.2 AA accessibility compliance.
* All security features remain unchanged.

The widget will display with a clean, unbranded appearance that integrates seamlessly with your website's design.

## Implementation

### Enable Offlabel

After your account team enables the Offlabel entitlement, you can activate it for specific widgets using the Cloudflare API.

```bash
curl -X PUT "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/$ACCOUNT_ID/challenges/widgets/$WIDGET_ID" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
    "offlabel": true
}'
```

### Create new widgets with Offlabel

You can enable Offlabel when creating new widgets.

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/$ACCOUNT_ID/challenges/widgets" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
    "name": "Branded Widget",
    "domains": ["example.com"],
    "mode": "managed",
    "offlabel": true
}'
```

### Verification

Confirm Offlabel is enabled by checking your widget configuration.

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/$ACCOUNT_ID/challenges/widgets/$WIDGET_ID" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN"
```

The response will include `"offlabel": true` when the feature is active.

### Link to Cloudflare's Turnstile Privacy Policy

As a condition of enabling offlabel, you must reference Cloudflare's [Turnstile Privacy Addendum ↗](https://www.cloudflare.com/turnstile-privacy-policy/) in one of two ways:

1. Link to it in your own privacy policy.
2. Configure the widget to display a link to Cloudflare's privacy policy using the [JavaScript Render Parameters](https://developers.cloudflare.com/turnstile/get-started/client-side-rendering/widget-configurations/#complete-configuration-reference).
