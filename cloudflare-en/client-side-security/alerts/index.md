# Alerts

Last updated May 7, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/client-side-security/alerts/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Note

New resource alerts require a Business plan or higher. Code change and malicious resource alerts require Client-Side Security Advanced. For details, refer to [Alert types](https://developers.cloudflare.com/client-side-security/alerts/alert-types/).

Once you have activated client-side security's resource monitoring, you can set up one or more alerts informing you of relevant client-side changes on your zones. 

You can configure unscoped or scoped alerts:

* **Unscoped alert**: Covers all zones in your Cloudflare account. Unscoped alerts are triggered either daily, hourly, or immediately, depending on the [alert type](https://developers.cloudflare.com/client-side-security/alerts/alert-types/).
* **Scoped alert**: Covers one or more specific zones. Requires [content security rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/client-side-security/rules/) configured in those zones. Scoped alerts are triggered immediately and only notify you about resources that are covered by your rules. [Rule violations](https://developers.cloudflare.com/client-side-security/rules/violations/) do not trigger these alerts. For more information, refer to [Scoped alerts](#scoped-alerts).

For alerts sent at regular intervals, you might experience a delay between adding a new script and receiving an alert.

For instructions on configuring alerts, refer to [Configure an alert](https://developers.cloudflare.com/client-side-security/alerts/configure/).

## Scoped alerts

Note

Only available to customers with Client-Side Security Advanced.

If you have configured [content security rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/client-side-security/rules/) in a zone, you can filter alert notifications according to those rules. These alerts are called scoped alerts.

When you create a scoped alert using the **Policies of these zones** alert filter, you will only receive the most relevant notifications based on the rules you configured.

For each scoped alert, Cloudflare does the following:

1. Check which content security rules are enabled in a zone, either in allow or in log mode.
2. For every enabled rule, compare the URL of the new or changed resource against the allowed sources in the rule.
3. If the resource is allowed by the rule, check if the new or modified resource should trigger the current alert.
4. If the alert should trigger, send an alert notification to the configured destinations.

When you create a scoped alert you will not receive notifications for resources that are not allowed by a content security rule (either [in allow or in log mode](https://developers.cloudflare.com/client-side-security/rules/#rule-actions)). These are [rule violations](https://developers.cloudflare.com/client-side-security/rules/violations/) that you can review in the dashboard, through GraphQL, or via Logpush.

Note

Scoped alerts only fire if the zone has at least one enabled content security rule.

For unscoped alerts, you will receive notifications for all resources detected across your zones. Some of these resources may also violate your configured content security rules.
