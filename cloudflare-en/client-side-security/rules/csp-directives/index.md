# Supported CSP directives

Last updated May 5, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/client-side-security/rules/csp-directives/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

[Content security rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/client-side-security/rules/) support most Content Security Policy (CSP) directives, covering both monitored and unmonitored resources. You can use a content security rule to control other types of resources besides scripts and their connections, even though Cloudflare is not monitoring these resources.

Each CSP directive can contain multiple values, including:

* Schemes
* Hostnames
* URIs
* Special keywords between single quotes (for example, `'none'`)
* Hashes between single quotes (for example, `'sha384-oqVuAfXRKap7fdgcCY5uykM6+R9GqQ8K/uxy9rx7HNQlGYl1kPzQho1wx4JwY8wC'`)

Hostname and URI values support a `*` wildcard for the leftmost subdomain.

The following table lists the supported CSP directives and special values you can use in content security rules:

| Directive                 | Name in the dashboard     | Supported special values                         | Monitored                                                                                            |
