# Client-side security

Last updated Jul 14, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/client-side-security/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Ensures the safety and privacy of your website visitors' browsing environment.

Available on all plans

Websites load third-party scripts for analytics, ads, chat widgets, and payment forms. If an attacker compromises one of these scripts, they can steal visitor data directly from the browser, an attack known as a [client-side supply chain attack ↗](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/what-is-a-supply-chain-attack/). Client-side security (formerly Page Shield) gives you visibility into these resources and alerts you when something changes or looks malicious.

Client-side security monitors scripts, connections, and cookies loaded by your website visitors. You can set up alert notifications and create content security rules to control which resources are allowed on your pages.
