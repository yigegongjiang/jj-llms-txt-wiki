To download and install `cloudflared` manually, use one of the following links.

### Docker

A Docker image of `cloudflared` is [available on DockerHub ↗](https://hub.docker.com/r/cloudflare/cloudflared).

## Deprecated releases

Cloudflare supports versions of `cloudflared` that are within one year of the most recent release. Breaking changes unrelated to feature availability may be introduced that will impact versions released more than one year ago. For example, as of January 2023 Cloudflare will support `cloudflared` version 2023.1.1 to cloudflared 2022.1.1.
