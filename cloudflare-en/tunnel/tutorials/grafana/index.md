# Monitor Cloudflare Tunnel with Grafana

Last updated May 5, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/tunnel/tutorials/grafana/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

[Grafana ↗](https://grafana.com/) is a dashboard tool that visualizes data stored in other databases. You can use Grafana to convert your [tunnel metrics](https://developers.cloudflare.com/tunnel/monitoring/#metrics) into actionable insights.

It is not possible to push metrics directly from `cloudflared` to Grafana. Instead, `cloudflared` runs a [Prometheus ↗](https://prometheus.io) metrics endpoint, which a Prometheus server periodically scrapes. Grafana then uses Prometheus as a data source to present metrics to the administrator.

This tutorial covers how to create the metrics endpoint, set up the Prometheus server, and view the data in Grafana.

## Before you begin

* You will need a Cloudflare Tunnel. To create a tunnel, refer to our [getting started guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/tunnel/setup/).

## Create the metrics endpoint

If your tunnel was created via the CLI, run the following command on the `cloudflared` server (`192.168.1.1`):

```sh
cloudflared tunnel --metrics 192.168.1.1:60123 run my-tunnel
```

If your tunnel was created via the dashboard, the [\--metrics](https://developers.cloudflare.com/tunnel/advanced/run-parameters/#metrics) flag must be added to your `cloudflared` system service configuration. Refer to [Add tunnel run parameters](https://developers.cloudflare.com/tunnel/advanced/run-parameters/#add-run-parameters-to-tunnel-service) for instructions on how to do this.

## Set up Prometheus

On the Prometheus and Grafana server (`192.168.1.2`):

1. [Download ↗](https://prometheus.io/download/) Prometheus.
2. Extract Prometheus:  
```sh  
tar xvfz prometheus-*.tar.gz  
cd prometheus-*  
```
3. Open `prometheus.yml` in a text editor and add the `cloudflared` job to the end of the file:  
```yml  
# my global config  
global:  
  scrape_interval: 15s # Set the scrape interval to every 15 seconds. Default is every 1 minute.  
  evaluation_interval: 15s # Evaluate rules every 15 seconds. The default is every 1 minute.  
  # scrape_timeout is set to the global default (10s).  
# Alertmanager configuration  
alerting:  
  alertmanagers:
    - static_configs:
        - targets:  
          # - alertmanager:9093  
# Load rules once and periodically evaluate them according to the global 'evaluation_interval'.  
rule_files:  
  # - "first_rules.yml"  
  # - "second_rules.yml"  
# A scrape configuration containing exactly one endpoint to scrape:  
# Here it's Prometheus itself.  
scrape_configs:  
  # The job name is added as a label `job=<job_name>` to any timeseries scraped from this config.
  - job_name: "prometheus"  
    # metrics_path defaults to '/metrics'  
    # scheme defaults to 'http'.  
    static_configs:
      - targets: ["localhost:9090"] ## Address of Prometheus dashboard

  - job_name: "cloudflared"  
    static_configs:
      - targets: ["198.168.1.1:60123"] ## cloudflared server IP and the --metrics port configured for the tunnel  
```
4. Start Prometheus:  
```sh  
./prometheus --config.file="prometheus.yml"  
```  
You can optionally configure Prometheus to run as a service so that it does not need to be manually started if the machine reboots.
5. Open a browser and go to `http://localhost:9090/`. You should be able to access the Prometheus dashboard.
6. To verify that Prometheus is fetching tunnel metrics, enter `cloudflared_tunnel_total_requests` into the expression console and select **Execute**.

Refer to [Available metrics](https://developers.cloudflare.com/tunnel/monitoring/#metrics) to check what other metrics are available.

## Connect Grafana to Prometheus

1. [Download ↗](https://grafana.com/grafana/download) and install Grafana.
2. Start Grafana as a system service:  
```sh  
sudo systemctl daemon-reload  
sudo systemctl start grafana-server  
```
3. Verify that Grafana is running:  
```sh  
sudo systemctl status grafana-server  
```
4. Open a browser and go to `http://localhost:3000/`. The default HTTP port that Grafana listens to is `3000` unless you have configured a different port.
5. On the sign-in page, enter your Grafana credentials.  
To test without an account, you can enter `admin` for both the username and password and skip the password change step.
6. In Grafana, go to **Connections** \> **Data sources**.
7. Select **Add a new data source** and select **Prometheus**.
8. In the **Prometheus server URL** field, enter the IP address and port of your Prometheus dashboard (`http://localhost:9090`).
9. Select **Save & test**.

## Build Grafana dashboard

1. In Grafana, go to **Dashboards** \> **New** \> **New dashboard**.
2. Select **Add visualization**.
3. Select **Prometheus**.
4. In the metrics field, enter `cloudflared_tunnel_total_requests` and select **Run queries**. You will see a graph showing the number of requests as a function of time.

You can add operations to the queries to modify what is displayed. For example, you could show all tunnel requests over a recent period of time, such as a day, rather than all tunnel requests since metrics began reporting.
