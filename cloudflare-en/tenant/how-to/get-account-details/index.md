# Get account details

Last updated Apr 21, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/tenant/how-to/get-account-details/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

An [**Account**](https://developers.cloudflare.com/tenant/glossary/#account) will contain various settings, resources, and subscriptions to products for users. Each Tenant can have multiple associated accounts.

To retrieve a list of accounts associated with a Tenant details, send a `GET` request to the `/tenants/{tenant_id}/accounts` endpoint. You can find the Tenant tag and all Tenants associated with the user with the [**Tenant Details**](https://developers.cloudflare.com/tenant/how-to/get-tenant-details/) API. The Tenant Accounts API also requires pagination passed as query parameters:

* `page` number

  * Page number of accounts list response, indexed from 1
* `per_page` number

  * Number of accounts to display per page
* `order` string

  * (optional) Order by a specific column, has to be a valid top-level key from the response
  * `direction` number

    * (optional) 0 for ascending or 1 for descending, is 0 by default

```bash
curl "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/tenants/{tenant_id}/accounts?page=1&per_page=10" \
--header "X-Auth-Email: <EMAIL>" \
--header "X-Auth-Key: <API_KEY>"
```

A successful request will return an HTTP status of `200` and a response body containing account information and feature flags for all accounts managed by the Tenant.
