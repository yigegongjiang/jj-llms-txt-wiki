# Manage accounts

Last updated Jun 29, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/tenant/how-to/manage-accounts/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Each customer or team that uses Cloudflare should have their own account. This ensures proper security and access of resources. Each account acts as a container of zones and other resources. Depending on your needs, you may even provision multiple accounts for a single customer or team.

When you create an account with the Tenant API, your Cloudflare user owns that account from creation, ongoing management, and finally deletion.

## Create account

Each customer or team that uses Cloudflare should have their own account. This ensures proper security and access of resources. Each account acts as a container of zones and other resources. Depending on your needs, you may even provision multiple accounts for a single customer or team.

When you create an account with the Tenant API, your Cloudflare user owns that account from creation, ongoing management, and finally deletion.

To create an account under your tenant using the dashboard:

1. Log into the [Cloudflare dashboard ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com).
2. Go to **Tenants** \> **Managed Accounts**.
3. Select **Create Account**.
4. Enter the **Account Name**, **Account Description**, and **Tenant Unit**.
5. Choose the appropriate account subscription.
6. Select **Add Account**.

To create an account using the API, make a `POST` request to the `/accounts` endpoint and include the following values:

* `name` string

  * The name of the account that is displayed in the Cloudflare dashboard.
* `type` enum

  * Valid values are `standard` (default) and `enterprise`. For self-serve customers, use `standard`. For enterprise customers, use `enterprise`.
* `unit` object

  * Information related to the tenant unit.
  * `id` string

    * (optional) ID of the unit to create this account on. Needs to be specified if user administers multiple tenants. Unit ID is the `unit_tag` from your [tenant details](https://developers.cloudflare.com/tenant/how-to/get-tenant-details/).

### Know-Your-Customer (optional)

All KYC parameters are text fields, have a 120 character limit, and are optional unless enforced by the Tenant.

* `business_name` string

  * (optional) The name of the business associated with this account.
* `business_address` string

  * (optional) The address of the business associated with this account.
* `business_email` string

  * (optional) The email of the business associated with this account.
* `business_phone` string

  * (optional) The phone number of the business associated with this account.
* `external_metadata` string

  * (optional) External metadata for this account.

```bash
curl "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts" \
--header "X-Auth-Email: <EMAIL>" \
--header "X-Auth-Key: <API_KEY>" \
--header "Content-Type: application/json" \
--data '{
  "name": "<ACCOUNT_NAME>",
  "type": "standard"
}'
```

A successful request will return an HTTP status of `200` and the following response body:

```json
{
  "result": {
    "id": "2bab6ace8c72ed3f09b9eca6db1396bb",
    "name": "<ACCOUNT_NAME>",
    "type": "standard",
    "settings": {
      "enforce_twofactor": false
    }
  },
  "success": true,
  "errors": [],
  "messages": []
}
```

A request with a unit ID:

```bash
curl "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts" \
--header "X-Auth-Email: <EMAIL>" \
--header "X-Auth-Key: <API_KEY>" \
--header "Content-Type: application/json" \
--data '{
  "name": "<ACCOUNT_NAME>",
  "type": "standard",
  "unit": {
    "id": "1a2b3c4d5e6f7g8h"
  }
}'
```

A request with a unit ID and KYC:

```bash
curl "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts" \
--header "X-Auth-Email: <EMAIL>" \
--header "X-Auth-Key: <API_KEY>" \
--header "Content-Type: application/json" \
--data '{
  "name": "<ACCOUNT_NAME>",
  "type": "standard",
  "business_name": "Cloudflare",
  "business_email": "email@business.com",
  "business_address": "San Francisco",
  "business_phone": "1234567890",
  "external_metadata": "{'\''testKey'\'': '\''testValue'\''}",
  "unit": {
    "id": "1a2b3c4d5e6f7g8h"
  }
}'
```

## View accounts

When you create an account with the Tenant API, your Cloudflare user owns that account from creation, ongoing management, and finally deletion.

To view any accounts owned by your tenant using the dashboard:

1. Log into the [Cloudflare dashboard ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com).
2. Go to **Tenants** \> **Managed Accounts**.

To fetch any accounts owned by your tenant using the API, send a [GET](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/accounts/methods/list/) request to the `/accounts` endpoint.

You will get back a list of all the accounts you have created plus any accounts your user already had access to.

```bash
curl https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts \
--header "X-Auth-Email: <EMAIL>" \
--header "X-Auth-Key: <API_KEY>"
```

```json
{
	"result": [
		{
			"id": "a34bd6cc645a31486aa2ef71f1b9afb6",
			"name": "My Personal Account",
			"settings": {
				"enforce_twofactor": false
			}
		},
		{
			"id": "1b16db169c9cb7853009857198fae1b9",
			"name": "Created Account",
			"settings": {
				"enforce_twofactor": false
			}
		}
	],
	"result_info": {
		"page": 1,
		"per_page": 20,
		"total_pages": 1,
		"count": 2,
		"total_count": 2
	},
	"success": true,
	"errors": [],
	"messages": []
}
```

## Update account

To update an account, send a [PUT](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/accounts/methods/update/) request to the `/accounts/{account_id}` endpoint.

## Delete account

To delete an account you have created, send a `DELETE` request to the `/accounts/{account_id}` endpoint.

Account deletion is permanent and will delete any zones or other resources under the account.

Some resources require manual deletion

The following resources are **not** automatically deleted when you delete an account and must be removed manually beforehand:

* **Logpush jobs**: Will continue delivering logs after account deletion.
* **Zero Trust Gateway configurations**: May continue resolving DNS queries after account deletion.

To ensure complete cleanup, delete these resources before deleting the account by calling the following endpoints in sequence:

1. Delete Zero Trust Gateway configuration:  
```bash  
curl --request DELETE \  
https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/{account_id}/gateway \
--header "X-Auth-Email: <EMAIL>" \
--header "X-Auth-Key: <API_KEY>"  
```
2. Delete Access organization:  
```bash  
curl --request DELETE \  
https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/{account_id}/access/organizations \
--header "X-Auth-Email: <EMAIL>" \
--header "X-Auth-Key: <API_KEY>"  
```
3. Then delete the account (see below).

```bash
curl --request DELETE \
https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/{account_id} \
--header "X-Auth-Email: <EMAIL>" \
--header "X-Auth-Key: <API_KEY>"
```

A successful request will return the id to confirm the operation:

```json
{
	"result": {
		"id": "1b16db169c9cb7853009857198fae1b9"
	},
	"success": true,
	"errors": [],
	"messages": []
}
```
