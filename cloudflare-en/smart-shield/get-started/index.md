# Get started

Last updated Jun 16, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/smart-shield/get-started/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Smart Shield reduces the load on your origin server and improves content delivery by consolidating requests through Cloudflare's caching infrastructure. It is available to all customers as an opt-in configuration.

## Before you begin

* You must have a Cloudflare account and [onboard your domain](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/manage-domains/add-site/).
* Verify that DNS records for the domain you want to protect are set to [proxied](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/proxy-status/). Smart Shield operates within Cloudflare's reverse proxy, so traffic from DNS-only records is not routed through it.

## Steps

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/), and select your account and domain.
2. Go to **Speed** \> **Smart Shield**.
3. (Optional) Explore the different [available packages](#packages-and-availability).
4. Select **Get started for free** or choose a different package and select **Continue** to proceed to the guided onboarding flow.

After setup, you can monitor origin performance and cache effectiveness through the [Observatory](https://developers.cloudflare.com/speed/observatory/) dashboard.

## Packages and availability

Pro, Business, and Enterprise customers have access to [Health Checks](https://developers.cloudflare.com/smart-shield/configuration/health-checks/) for monitoring origin availability across all packages.

Enterprise customers have access to all Smart Shield packages, including Smart Shield Advanced.

### Smart Shield

The base package for reducing origin load through caching and connection optimization.

* Includes [Smart Tiered Cache](https://developers.cloudflare.com/smart-shield/configuration/smart-tiered-cache/) and [Connection Reuse](https://developers.cloudflare.com/smart-shield/concepts/connection-reuse/).

### Smart Shield + Argo

Adds network path optimization on top of the base package. Use when visitors are geographically distant from the origin server.

* Includes [Smart Tiered Cache](https://developers.cloudflare.com/smart-shield/configuration/smart-tiered-cache/), [Connection Reuse](https://developers.cloudflare.com/smart-shield/concepts/connection-reuse/), and [Argo Smart Routing](https://developers.cloudflare.com/smart-shield/configuration/argo/).

### Smart Shield Advanced

The full package with additional caching customization through regional and persistent storage options.

* Includes [Smart Tiered Cache](https://developers.cloudflare.com/smart-shield/configuration/smart-tiered-cache/), [Connection Reuse](https://developers.cloudflare.com/smart-shield/concepts/connection-reuse/), [Argo Smart Routing](https://developers.cloudflare.com/smart-shield/configuration/argo/), [Regional Tiered Cache](https://developers.cloudflare.com/smart-shield/configuration/regional-tiered-cache/), and [Cache Reserve](https://developers.cloudflare.com/smart-shield/configuration/cache-reserve/).

Enterprise customers have access to [Regional Tiered Cache](https://developers.cloudflare.com/smart-shield/configuration/regional-tiered-cache/) as part of their plan, regardless of which Smart Shield package they use.

Enterprise customers also have the option to configure [Dedicated CDN Egress IPs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/smart-shield/configuration/dedicated-egress-ips/), allowing you to increase origin security by only allowing traffic from a small list of IP addresses. If you are interested, reach out to your account team.

Free, Pro, and Business customers can purchase Smart Shield and Smart Shield + Argo packages.
