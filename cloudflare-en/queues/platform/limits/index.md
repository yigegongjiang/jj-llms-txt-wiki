The following limits apply to both Workers Paid and Workers Free plans with the exception of **Message Retention**, which is non-configurable at 24 hours for the Workers Free plan.

1 1 KB is measured as 1000 bytes. Messages can include up to \~100 bytes of internal metadata that counts towards total message limits.

2 Exceeding the maximum message throughput will cause the `send()` and `sendBatch()` methods to throw an exception with a `Too Many Requests` error until your producer falls below the limit.

3 Messages in a queue that reach the maximum message retention are deleted from the queue. Queues does not delete messages in the same queue that have not reached this limit.

4 Individual queues that reach this limit will receive a `Storage Limit Exceeded` error when calling `send()` or `sendBatch()` on the queue.

5 Refer to [Workers limits](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/limits/#cpu-time).

### Increasing Queue Consumer Worker CPU Limits

[Queue consumer Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/queues/reference/how-queues-works/#consumers) are Worker scripts, and share the same [per invocation CPU limits](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/limits/#account-plan-limits) as any Workers do. Note that CPU time is active processing time: not time spent waiting on network requests, storage calls, or other general I/O.

By default, the maximum CPU time per consumer Worker invocation is set to 30 seconds, but can be increased by setting `limits.cpu_ms` in your Wrangler configuration:

```jsonc
{
  // ...rest of your configuration...
  "limits": {
    "cpu_ms": 300000, // 300,000 milliseconds = 5 minutes
  },
  // ...rest of your configuration...
}
```

```toml
[limits]
cpu_ms = 300_000
```

To learn more about CPU time and limits, [review the Workers documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/limits/#cpu-time).

## Wall time limits by invocation type

Wall time (also called wall-clock time) is the total elapsed time from the start to end of an invocation, including time spent waiting on network requests, I/O, and other asynchronous operations. This is distinct from [CPU time](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/limits/#cpu-time), which only measures time the CPU spends actively executing your code.

The following table summarizes the wall time limits for different types of Worker invocations across the developer platform:

| Invocation type                                                                                     | Wall time limit | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

A Worker that is still streaming a response body remains active. [waitUntil()](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/context/#waituntil) extends execution for up to 30 seconds after the response or disconnect. |
| [Cron Triggers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/cron-triggers/)             | 15 minutes      | Scheduled Workers have a maximum wall time of 15 minutes per invocation.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| [Queue consumers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/queues/configuration/javascript-apis/#consumer) | 15 minutes      | Each consumer invocation has a maximum wall time of 15 minutes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| [Durable Object alarm handlers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/api/alarms/)      | 15 minutes      | Alarm handler invocations have a maximum wall time of 15 minutes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| [Durable Objects](https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/) (RPC / HTTP)                  | Unlimited       | No hard limit while the caller stays connected to the Durable Object. Durable Objects remain active while a request, RPC call, response stream, WebSocket, or pending I/O is in flight.                                                                                              |
| [Workflows](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workflows/) (per step)                                | Unlimited       | Each step can run for an unlimited wall time. Individual steps are subject to the configured [CPU time limit](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/limits/#cpu-time).                                                                                                  |
