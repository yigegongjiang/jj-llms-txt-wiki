# Event subscriptions

Last updated Apr 21, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/queues/event-subscriptions/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Event subscriptions allow you to receive messages when events occur across your Cloudflare account. Cloudflare products (e.g., [KV](https://developers.cloudflare.com/kv/), [Workers AI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai), [Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers)) can publish structured events to a queue, which you can then consume with Workers or [HTTP pull consumers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/queues/configuration/pull-consumers/) to build custom workflows, integrations, or logic.

## What is an event?

An event is a structured record of something happening in your Cloudflare account – like a Workers AI batch request being queued, a Worker build completing, or an R2 bucket being created. When you subscribe to these events, your queue will automatically start receiving messages when the events occur.
