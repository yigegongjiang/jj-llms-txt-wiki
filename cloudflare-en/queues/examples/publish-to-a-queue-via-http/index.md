# Publish to a Queue via HTTP

Publish to a Queue directly via HTTP.

Last updated Apr 21, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/queues/examples/publish-to-a-queue-via-http/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

The following example shows you how to publish messages to a Queue from any HTTP client, using a Cloudflare API token to authenticate.

This allows you to write to a Queue from any service or programming language that supports HTTP, including Go, Rust, Python or even a Bash script.

## Prerequisites

* A [queue created](https://developers.cloudflare.com/queues/get-started/#3-create-a-queue) via the [Cloudflare dashboard ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com) or the [wrangler CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/).
* A Cloudflare API token with the `Queues Edit` permission.

### 1\. Send a test message

To make sure you successfully authenticate and write a message to your queue, use `curl` on the command line:

```sh
# Make sure to replace the placeholder with your shared secret
curl -XPOST -H "Authorization: Bearer <paste-your-api-token-here>" "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/<paste-your-account-id-here>/queues/<paste-your-queue-id-here>/messages" --data '{ "body": { "greeting": "hello" } }'
```

```sh
{"success":true}
```

This will issue a HTTP POST request, and if successful, return a HTTP 200 with a `success: true` response body.

* If you receive a HTTP 403, this is because your API token is invalid or does not have the `Queues Edit` permission.

For full documentation about the HTTP Push API, refer to the [Cloudflare API documentation ↗](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/queues/subresources/messages/).
