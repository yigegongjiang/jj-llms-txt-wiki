# Use Queues from Durable Objects

Publish to a queue from within a Durable Object.

Last updated Apr 21, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/queues/examples/use-queues-with-durable-objects/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

The following example shows you how to write a Worker script to publish to [Cloudflare Queues](https://developers.cloudflare.com/queues/) from within a [Durable Object](https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/).

Prerequisites:

* A [queue created](https://developers.cloudflare.com/queues/get-started/#3-create-a-queue) via the Cloudflare dashboard or the [wrangler CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/).
* A [configured **producer** binding](https://developers.cloudflare.com/queues/configuration/configure-queues/#producer-worker-configuration) in the Cloudflare dashboard or Wrangler file.
* A [Durable Object namespace binding](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/#durable-objects).

Configure your Wrangler file as follows:

```jsonc
{
	"$schema": "./node_modules/wrangler/config-schema.json",
	"name": "my-worker",
	"queues": {
		"producers": [
			{
				"queue": "my-queue",
				"binding": "YOUR_QUEUE"
			}
		]
	},
	"durable_objects": {
		"bindings": [
			{
				"name": "YOUR_DO_CLASS",
				"class_name": "YourDurableObject"
			}
		]
	},
	"migrations": [
		{
			"tag": "v1",
			"new_sqlite_classes": [
				"YourDurableObject"
			]
		}
	]
}
```

```toml
"$schema" = "./node_modules/wrangler/config-schema.json"
name = "my-worker"

[[queues.producers]]
queue = "my-queue"
binding = "YOUR_QUEUE"

[[durable_objects.bindings]]
name = "YOUR_DO_CLASS"
class_name = "YourDurableObject"

[[migrations]]
tag = "v1"
new_sqlite_classes = [ "YourDurableObject" ]
```

The following Worker script:

1. Creates a Durable Object stub, or retrieves an existing one based on a userId.
2. Passes request data to the Durable Object.
3. Publishes to a queue from within the Durable Object.

Extending the `DurableObject` base class makes your `Env` available on `this.env` and the Durable Object state available on `this.ctx` within the [fetch() handler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/best-practices/create-durable-object-stubs-and-send-requests/) in the Durable Object.

```ts
import { DurableObject } from "cloudflare:workers";

interface Env {
  YOUR_QUEUE: Queue;
  YOUR_DO_CLASS: DurableObjectNamespace<YourDurableObject>;
}

export default {
  async fetch(req, env, ctx): Promise<Response> {
    // Assume each Durable Object is mapped to a userId in a query parameter
    // In a production application, this will be a userId defined by your application
    // that you validate (and/or authenticate) first.
    const url = new URL(req.url);
    const userIdParam = url.searchParams.get("userId");

    if (userIdParam) {
      // Get a stub that allows you to call that Durable Object
      const durableObjectStub = env.YOUR_DO_CLASS.getByName(userIdParam);

      // Pass the request to that Durable Object and await the response
      // This invokes the constructor once on your Durable Object class (defined further down)
      // on the first initialization, and the fetch method on each request.
      // We pass the original Request to the Durable Object's fetch method
      const response = await durableObjectStub.fetch(req);

      // This would return "wrote to queue", but you could return any response.
      return response;
    }
    return new Response("userId must be provided", { status: 400 });
  },
} satisfies ExportedHandler<Env>;

export class YourDurableObject extends DurableObject<Env> {
  async fetch(req: Request): Promise<Response> {
    // Error handling elided for brevity.
    // Publish to your queue
    await this.env.YOUR_QUEUE.send({
      id: this.ctx.id.toString(), // Write the ID of the Durable Object to your queue
      // Write any other properties to your queue
    });

    return new Response("wrote to queue");
  }
}
```
