# Send messages from the dashboard

Use the dashboard to send messages to a queue.

Last updated Apr 21, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/queues/examples/send-messages-from-dash/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Sending messages from the dashboard allows you to debug Queues or queue consumers without a producer Worker.

To send messages from the dashboard:

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Queues** page.  
[Go to **Queues** ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/workers/queues)
2. Select the queue to send a message to.
3. Select the **Messages** tab.
4. Select **Send**.
5. Choose your message **Content Type**: _Text_ or _JSON_.
6. Enter your message. Alternatively, drag a file over the textbox to upload a file as a message.
7. Select **Send**.

Your message will be sent to the queue.

Refer to the [Get Started guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/queues/get-started/) to learn how to send messages to a queue from a Worker.
