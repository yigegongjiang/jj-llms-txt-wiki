# Cloudflare Security Center

Last updated May 5, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/security-center/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Cloudflare Security Center brings together your Cloudflare security products, threat intelligence from Cloudflare's global network, and configuration analysis into a unified security intelligence solution. Security Center enables you to strengthen your security posture by:

* **Mapping your attack surface** — identifying the Internet-facing assets (domains, DNS records, and IP addresses) associated with your Cloudflare account
* **Providing asset inventory and discovery** — listing the infrastructure Cloudflare detects across your account so you can review what is exposed
* **Identifying potential security risks, misconfigurations, and vulnerabilities** — running automated scans that compare your current Cloudflare configuration against ideal settings
* **Helping you mitigate these risks** — connecting each finding to the relevant Cloudflare product setting so you can resolve issues from the dashboard

## Main features

* **[Security Insights](https://developers.cloudflare.com/security/security-insights/)**: Review and manage potential security risks and vulnerabilities associated with your IT infrastructure. Security Insights scans your Cloudflare account settings — including DNS records, SSL/TLS certificates, WAF configurations, and Access configurations — and reports findings with severity levels.
* **[Infrastructure](https://developers.cloudflare.com/security-center/infrastructure/)**: Review and manage your IT infrastructure. The Infrastructure tab displays the domains, IP addresses, and other assets associated with your Cloudflare account.
* **[Investigate](https://developers.cloudflare.com/security-center/investigate/)**: Investigate threats using data from Cloudflare's global network. Look up any IP address, domain, or hostname to view its category, country of origin, and passive DNS records.
* **[Security Reports](https://developers.cloudflare.com/analytics/account-and-zone-analytics/app-security-reports/)** (beta): Gain visibility into requests blocked or challenged by Cloudflare application security products, including [HTTP DDoS Protection](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ddos-protection/managed-rulesets/http/), [WAF](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/), and [Bot Management](https://developers.cloudflare.com/bots/).
* **[Brand Protection](https://developers.cloudflare.com/security-center/brand-protection/)** (beta): Search for newly registered domains that may be attempting to impersonate your brand. Brand Protection monitors for typosquatting, homoglyph attacks, and service concatenation.
