You can manage your [security.txt ↗](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security.txt) file via the dashboard or the [API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/security%5Ftxt/).

To manage your security.txt file via the Cloudflare dashboard:

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/), select your account and domain.

From here, you can create and manage your `security.txt` file to provide the security research team with a standardized way to report vulnerabilities.

  * A URL link: The URL link must start with `https://` (for example, `https://example.com`).  
Select **Add more** to add multiple contacts.
* **(Required) Expires at**: Enter the expiration date and time of the `security.txt` file.
* **Encryption**: A link to a key which security researchers can use to communicate with you.
* **Acknowledgements**: A link to your acknowledgements page.
* **Canonical**: Links to your `security.txt` file.
* **Hiring**: A link to your security-related job openings.
* **Policy**: A link to a policy describing what security researchers should do when searching for or reporting security issues.
