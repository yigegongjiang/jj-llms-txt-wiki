# Objects

Last updated Apr 30, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/objects/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Objects are individual files or data that you store in an R2 bucket. Each object is identified by its key, a string like `images/photo.png`.

## Prefixes and folders

R2 uses a flat storage structure. There are no real directories or folders. The `/` character in an object key is used as a delimiter to group objects by prefix.

The R2 dashboard groups objects that share a common prefix into folders when the **View prefixes as directories** checkbox is selected. For example, objects with keys `logs/jan.csv` and `logs/feb.csv` appear under a `logs/` folder. These folders are a visual grouping and do not exist as separate resources in your bucket.
