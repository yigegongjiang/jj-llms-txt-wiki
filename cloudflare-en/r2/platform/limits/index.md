Limits specified in MiB (mebibyte), GiB (gibibyte), or TiB (tebibyte) are storage units of measurement based on base-2\. 1 GiB (gibibyte) is equivalent to 230 bytes (or 10243 bytes). This is distinct from 1 GB (gigabyte), which is 109 bytes (or 10003 bytes).

Need a higher limit?

To request an adjustment to a limit, complete the [Limit Increase Request Form ↗](https://forms.gle/eX6pXvit1wBv77Yw5). If the limit can be increased, Cloudflare will contact you with next steps.

## Rate limiting on managed public buckets through `r2.dev`

Managed public bucket access through an `r2.dev` subdomain is not intended for production usage and has a variable rate limit applied to it. The `r2.dev` endpoint for your bucket is designed to enable testing.

* If you exceed the rate limit (hundreds of requests/second), requests to your `r2.dev` endpoint will be temporarily throttled and you will receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response.
* Bandwidth (throughput) may also be throttled when using the `r2.dev` endpoint.

For production use cases, connect a [custom domain](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/buckets/public-buckets/#custom-domains) to your bucket. Custom domains allow you to serve content from a domain you control (for example, `assets.example.com`), configure fine-grained caching, set up redirect and rewrite rules, mutate content via [Cloudflare Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/), and get detailed URL-level analytics for content served from your R2 bucket.

## Cloudflare REST API

The [Cloudflare REST API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/r2/) is rate limited to 1,200 requests per five minutes across all R2 REST API operations on your account.

For high-throughput object operations, use the [S3-compatible API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/api/s3/api/) or [Workers API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/api/workers/workers-api-reference/) instead. The Cloudflare REST API is best suited for lower-volume management and configuration operations.

## Footnotes

1. Bucket management operations include creating, deleting, listing, and configuring buckets. This limit does _not_ apply to reading or writing objects to a bucket. [↩](#user-content-fnref-1)
2. The object size limit is 5 GiB less than 5 TiB, so 4.995 TiB. [↩](#user-content-fnref-2)
3. Max upload size applies to uploading a file via one request, uploading a part of a multipart upload, or copying into a part of a multipart upload. If you have a Worker, its inbound request size is constrained by [Workers request limits](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/limits#request-limits). The max upload size limit does not apply to subrequests. [↩](#user-content-fnref-3)
4. The max upload size is 5 MiB less than 5 GiB, so 4.995 GiB. [↩](#user-content-fnref-4)
5. Concurrent writes to the same object name (key) at a higher rate return HTTP 429 (rate limited) responses. [↩](#user-content-fnref-5)
