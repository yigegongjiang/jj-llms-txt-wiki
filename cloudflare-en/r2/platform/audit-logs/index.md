# Audit Logs

Last updated Apr 21, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/platform/audit-logs/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

[Audit logs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/account/account-security/review-audit-logs/) provide a comprehensive summary of changes made within your Cloudflare account, including those made to R2 buckets. This functionality is available on all plan types, free of charge, and is always enabled.

## Viewing audit logs

To view audit logs for your R2 buckets, go to the **Audit logs** page.

[Go to **Audit logs** ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/audit-log) 

For more information on how to access and use audit logs, refer to [Review audit logs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/account/account-security/review-audit-logs/).

Note

Logs for data access operations, such as `GetObject` and `PutObject`, are not included in audit logs. To log HTTP requests made to public R2 buckets, use the [HTTP requests](https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/logpush/logpush-job/datasets/zone/http%5Frequests/) Logpush dataset.
