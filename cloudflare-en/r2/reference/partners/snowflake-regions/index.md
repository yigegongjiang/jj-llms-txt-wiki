# Snowflake

Last updated Aug 18, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/reference/partners/snowflake-regions/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

This page details which R2 location or jurisdiction is recommended based on your Snowflake region.

You have the following inputs to control the physical location where objects in your R2 buckets are stored (for more information refer to [data location](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/reference/data-location/)):

* [**Location hints**](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/reference/data-location/#location-hints): Specify a geophrical area (for example, Asia-Pacific or Western Europe). R2 makes a best effort to place your bucket in or near that location to optimize performance. You can confirm bucket placement after creation by navigating to the **Settings** tab of your bucket and referring to the **Bucket details** section.
* [**Jurisdictions**](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/reference/data-location/#jurisdictional-restrictions): Enforce that data is both stored and processed within a specific jurisdiction (for example, US, EU, or FedRAMP environments). Use jurisdictions when you need to ensure data is stored and processed within a jurisdiction to meet data residency requirements, including local regulations such as the [GDPR ↗](https://gdpr-info.eu/) or [FedRAMP ↗](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-achieves-fedramp-authorization/).
