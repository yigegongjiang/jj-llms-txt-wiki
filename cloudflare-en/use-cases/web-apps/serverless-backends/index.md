# Build serverless backends

Last updated Apr 24, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/use-cases/web-apps/serverless-backends/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Running backend code on traditional servers requires provisioning capacity, managing scaling, and accepting cold starts. Cloudflare Workers runs your server-side code at the edge with fast startup, automatic scaling, and global distribution across 300+ locations.

## Solutions

### Workers

Build and deploy serverless applications on Cloudflare's global network. [Learn more about Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/).

* **Global deployment** \- Code runs at the Cloudflare location nearest to each user automatically
* **Fast startup** \- V8 isolates start in milliseconds with no warm-up period, avoiding the cold start delays of container-based platforms
* **Auto-scaling** \- Handle traffic spikes without provisioning or configuration

### Cron Triggers

Schedule Workers to run on a recurring basis. [Learn more about Cron Triggers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/cron-triggers/).

* **Scheduled tasks** \- Run Workers on a fixed schedule for background jobs and periodic tasks

### Queues

Reliable message queuing and background processing for Workers. [Learn more about Queues](https://developers.cloudflare.com/queues/).

* **Async processing** \- Reliably process background jobs and webhooks without blocking request handling
