# Connect your internal network services

Last updated Apr 24, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/use-cases/apis/internal-services/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Internal services and microservices often need to communicate without exposing endpoints to the public Internet. Cloudflare Tunnel creates outbound-only connections with no inbound firewall rules, while Access enforces Zero Trust policies for every request between services.

## Solutions

### Cloudflare Tunnel

Connect infrastructure to Cloudflare without opening inbound firewall ports. [Learn more about Cloudflare Tunnel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-tunnel/).

* **No public exposure** \- Internal Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) remain private; Tunnel establishes an outbound-only connection with no inbound firewall rules needed

### Access

Zero Trust access control for applications and infrastructure. [Learn more about Access](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/access-controls/policies/).

* **Zero Trust policies** \- Verify identity and enforce per-service policies for every request between services
* **Centralized policy management** \- Manage access rules for all internal services from a single control plane

### Service Tokens

Non-interactive credentials for machine-to-machine authentication. [Learn more about Service Tokens](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/access-controls/service-credentials/service-tokens/).

* **Service-to-service auth** \- Authenticate internal services with non-interactive credentials managed in Cloudflare One
