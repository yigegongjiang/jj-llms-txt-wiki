# Protect your APIs

Last updated Apr 24, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/use-cases/apis/protect-apis/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

APIs are exposed to abuse, injection attacks, and unauthorized access. Cloudflare provides defense in depth with API Shield schema validation, per-endpoint rate limiting, mutual TLS (mTLS) client authentication, and security rules.

## Solutions

### API Shield

Discover, secure, and monitor your APIs. [Learn more about API Shield](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api-shield/).

* **Schema validation** \- Reject requests that do not conform to your OpenAPI specification before they reach your origin

### Rate Limiting

Limit request rates based on flexible matching criteria. [Learn more about Rate Limiting](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/rate-limiting-rules/).

* **Rate limiting** \- Prevent abuse and volumetric attacks with per-IP or per-API-key request limits

### mTLS

Mutual TLS client certificate authentication. [Learn more about mTLS](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/client-certificates/).

* **Client authentication** \- Require mutual TLS certificates for machine-to-machine communication

### Application Security

Get automatic protection from vulnerabilities and create your own custom rules. [Learn more about Application Security](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/).

* **Attack protection** \- Application security's managed rulesets block SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and other injection attacks

### Access

Zero Trust access control for applications and infrastructure. [Learn more about Access](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/access-controls/policies/).

* **Identity providers** \- Integrate with Okta, Azure AD, Google Workspace, and other identity providers (IdPs) to gate API access
* **Service tokens** \- Issue long-lived credentials for machine-to-machine authentication between services

### Workers

Build and deploy serverless applications on Cloudflare's global network. [Learn more about Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/).

* **JWT validation** \- Verify and decode JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) at the edge before requests reach your backend
* **Custom auth logic** \- Build any authentication scheme — API keys, Hash-based Message Authentication Code (HMAC) signatures, custom headers — directly at the edge
