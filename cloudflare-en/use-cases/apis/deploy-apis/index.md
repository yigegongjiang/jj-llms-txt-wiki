# Deploy APIs at the edge

Last updated Apr 24, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/use-cases/apis/deploy-apis/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Deploying APIs on traditional infrastructure means managing servers, configuring regions, and provisioning for traffic spikes. Cloudflare Workers runs your API handlers in 300+ locations worldwide with automatic scaling and fast startup times.

## Solutions

### Workers

Build and deploy serverless applications on Cloudflare's global network. [Learn more about Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/).

* **Global deployment** \- API handlers run in 300+ Cloudflare locations worldwide with no regional configuration
* **Auto-scaling** \- Handle traffic spikes without provisioning servers or setting capacity limits

### Queues

Reliable message queuing and background processing for Workers. [Learn more about Queues](https://developers.cloudflare.com/queues/).

* **Async processing** \- Offload webhook delivery and background jobs without blocking the API response

### D1 and Durable Objects

Serverless SQL database built on SQLite, with global read replication ([learn more about D1](https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/)). Stateful objects with strongly consistent storage and coordination ([learn more about Durable Objects](https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/)).

* **Integrated storage** \- Structured Query Language (SQL) database and strongly consistent state storage available as Worker bindings
