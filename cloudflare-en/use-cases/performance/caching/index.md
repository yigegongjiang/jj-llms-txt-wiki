# Cache content globally

Last updated Apr 24, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/use-cases/performance/caching/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Every request that reaches your origin server adds latency and costs. Cloudflare Cache serves static and dynamic content globally, reducing round-trip times for visitors and offloading traffic from your origin.

## Solutions

### Cache

Cache content at Cloudflare's global network of edge locations. [Learn more about Cache](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cache/).

* **Global distribution** \- Content cached in 300+ edge locations so visitors are served from the location nearest to them
* **Reduced latency** \- Cache hits are served directly from the edge, eliminating round-trips to your origin
* **Customizable cache rules** \- Create rules that change how Cloudflare caches content, or transforms requests
* **Origin offload** \- Regional cache tiers intercept repeated requests before they reach your origin server
* **Persistent caching** \- Long-tail content that would normally expire is kept in durable storage, reducing origin fetches for infrequently accessed assets

## Get started

1. [Configure Cache Rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cache/how-to/cache-rules/)
2. [Enable Tiered Cache](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cache/how-to/tiered-cache/)
