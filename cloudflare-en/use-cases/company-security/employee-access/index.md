# Access internal applications securely

Last updated Apr 24, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/use-cases/company-security/employee-access/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Traditional VPNs grant broad network access, create bottlenecks, and are difficult to scale. Cloudflare replaces VPNs with Zero Trust access — verifying identity and device posture on every request — using Cloudflare Tunnel, Access, and the Cloudflare One client.

## Solutions

### Cloudflare One

Secure your organization with a cloud security platform that replaces legacy perimeters with Cloudflare's global network. [Learn more about Cloudflare One](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/).

* **Zero Trust access** \- Verify identity and device posture on every request before granting access to internal applications
* **Granular policies** \- Control access by user, group, device posture, and location with per-application rules

### Cloudflare Tunnel

Connect infrastructure to Cloudflare without opening inbound firewall ports. [Learn more about Cloudflare Tunnel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-tunnel/).

* **No network exposure** \- Internal apps remain private; Tunnel creates an outbound-only connection with no inbound firewall changes

### Cloudflare One client

Securely route traffic through Cloudflare's network. [Learn more about Cloudflare One client](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/cloudflare-one-client/).

* **Better performance** \- Lower latency than traditional VPN architectures, as traffic routes through Cloudflare's global network rather than backhauling to a central data center
