# Store media at scale

Last updated Apr 24, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/use-cases/media-streaming/store-media/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Media files are large, and egress fees from traditional cloud storage can be significant at scale. Cloudflare R2 provides S3-compatible object storage with zero egress fees, and Workers lets you build custom processing pipelines for validation, transformation, and routing.

## Solutions

### R2

S3-compatible object storage with zero egress fees. [Learn more about R2](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/).

* **Zero egress fees** \- No charges for data transferred out, regardless of volume
* **S3 compatibility** \- Use any S3-compatible tool, SDK, or library without code changes
* **Direct uploads** \- Issue presigned URLs so clients upload directly to R2 without routing through your servers

### Workers

Build and deploy serverless applications on Cloudflare's global network. [Learn more about Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/).

* **Custom processing pipelines** \- Build media transformation, validation, and routing logic that runs at the edge
