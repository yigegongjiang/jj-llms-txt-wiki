# Cache and accelerate media delivery

Last updated Apr 24, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/use-cases/media-streaming/cache-delivery/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Streaming video and serving images to a global audience requires low-latency delivery from locations close to each viewer. Cloudflare Cache serves media globally, and Argo Smart Routing ensures cache misses take the fastest path back to your origin.

## Solutions

### Cache

Cache content at Cloudflare's global network of edge locations. [Learn more about Cache](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cache/).

* **Global edge caching** \- Media content served from 300+ edge locations to reduce latency for global audiences
* **Origin offload** \- Cached content is served directly from the edge, reducing origin bandwidth and compute costs
* **Tiered caching** \- Regional cache tiers absorb repeated requests before they reach the origin, further reducing load

### Argo Smart Routing

Route traffic through the fastest paths across Cloudflare's network. [Learn more about Argo Smart Routing](https://developers.cloudflare.com/argo-smart-routing/).

* **Smart routing** \- Requests that miss cache are routed through the fastest available network paths to origin
