# Media and streaming

Last updated Apr 24, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/use-cases/media-streaming/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Deliver video, images, and rich media at scale with encoding, optimization, and global distribution. Cloudflare Stream handles video upload, encoding, and adaptive bitrate delivery. Images transforms and optimizes images on-the-fly. R2 stores media files with zero egress fees. Cache serves content from 300+ edge locations. Hotlink Protection and signed URLs secure media from unauthorized access.

* [Optimize and transform images for the web](https://developers.cloudflare.com/use-cases/media-streaming/image-optimization/)
* [Store media at scale](https://developers.cloudflare.com/use-cases/media-streaming/store-media/)
* [Cache and accelerate media delivery](https://developers.cloudflare.com/use-cases/media-streaming/cache-delivery/)

## Architecture patterns

### Video platform

Build a complete video hosting and delivery solution:

* **Stream** handles upload, encoding, and adaptive bitrate delivery
* **Stream Live** enables live streaming with automatic recording
* **Signed URLs** protect content with token authentication

### Image optimization pipeline

Serve optimized images without pre-generating variants:

1. **R2** stores original high-resolution images
2. **Images** transforms images on-the-fly based on URL parameters
3. **Workers** applies custom logic for format selection and caching

### User-generated content

Handle media uploads from users at scale:

1. **R2** receives uploads directly via presigned URLs
2. **Workers** validates and processes uploaded content
3. **Stream** or **Images** optimizes media for delivery

## Prerequisites

### Create a new application

* A [Cloudflare account ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up). Stream and R2 are account-level offerings. You do not need a domain added to Cloudflare to upload, encode, or store media.
* For Image Transformations: enable the feature per domain from the [Transformations page ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/images/transformations) in the dashboard. Refer to [Image Transformations](https://developers.cloudflare.com/images/optimization/transformations/overview/).

### Use an existing application

* A [Cloudflare account ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up).
* A domain [added to Cloudflare](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/manage-domains/add-site/) with DNS records proxied through Cloudflare. This is required for CDN caching, image optimization (Polish), and cache rules.
* For Image Transformations on an existing domain: enable the feature from the [Transformations page ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/images/transformations) in the dashboard. Refer to [Image Transformations](https://developers.cloudflare.com/images/optimization/transformations/overview/).
