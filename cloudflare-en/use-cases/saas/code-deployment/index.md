# Enable customer code deployment

Last updated Apr 24, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/use-cases/saas/code-deployment/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

SaaS platforms often need to let customers run their own code — custom logic, integrations, webhooks — without compromising tenant isolation or platform stability. Cloudflare Workers for Platforms runs each customer's code in a separate V8 isolate with dispatch routing based on hostname, path, or header.

## Solutions

### Workers for Platforms

Deploy isolated Workers execution environments for your customers. [Learn more about Workers for Platforms](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-for-platforms/workers-for-platforms/).

* **Tenant isolation** \- Each customer's code runs in a separate V8 isolate with no shared memory between tenants
* **Custom logic** \- Customers can deploy their own Workers to extend or customize your platform's behavior
* **Dispatch routing** \- Route incoming requests to the correct customer Worker based on hostname, path, or header
* **Observability** \- Tail Workers capture logs and errors across all tenant code from a single integration
