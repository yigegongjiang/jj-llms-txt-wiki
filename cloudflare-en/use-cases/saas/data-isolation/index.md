# Store and isolate customer data

Last updated Apr 24, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/use-cases/saas/data-isolation/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Multi-tenant platforms need to store customer data with appropriate isolation — per-tenant databases, separate object storage, or row-level separation. Cloudflare provides serverless storage options that support tenant isolation at the database, bucket, or key-prefix level.

## Solutions

### D1

Serverless SQL database built on SQLite, with global read replication. [Learn more about D1](https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/).

* **Database per tenant** \- Create isolated D1 databases per customer for complete data separation, or use row-level isolation in a shared database

### R2

S3-compatible object storage with zero egress fees. [Learn more about R2](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/).

* **Object storage** \- Store customer files and assets per tenant using prefix or bucket-level isolation, with no egress fees

### Durable Objects

Stateful objects with strongly consistent storage and coordination. [Learn more about Durable Objects](https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/).

* **Real-time coordination** \- Manage stateful workflows and provide strong consistency for multi-tenant operations

### KV

Globally distributed key-value storage for low-latency reads. [Learn more about KV](https://developers.cloudflare.com/kv/).

* **Edge configuration** \- Store per-tenant settings, feature flags, and session data at the edge for low-latency reads
