# TypeScript Client SDK

Last updated Aug 26, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/flagship/sdk/client-provider/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

The `FlagshipClientProvider` implements the OpenFeature web provider interface for browser applications. It pre-fetches a declared set of flag values on initialization and resolves evaluations synchronously from an in-memory cache.

This makes the provider suitable for client-side rendering where synchronous access to flag values is required.

Caution

We do not recommend using the client provider in public-facing apps right now. It requires a Cloudflare API token, which would be exposed in client-side code and visible to anyone who inspects your application. We are working on a safer solution for client-side flag evaluation — in the meantime, use the [Worker binding](https://developers.cloudflare.com/flagship/binding/) or the [TypeScript server SDK](https://developers.cloudflare.com/flagship/sdk/server-provider/).

## prefetchFlags

`prefetchFlags` is a required array of flag keys that the provider fetches during initialization and on every context change. Only flags listed in this array are available for synchronous evaluation — any flag key not included returns a `FLAG_NOT_FOUND` error at resolution time.

**Fetch behavior:**

* **On initialization** — all flags in `prefetchFlags` are fetched in parallel and stored in an in-memory cache. The provider transitions to `READY` once all fetches complete (individual failures are non-fatal).
* **On context change** — the cache is invalidated and all flags are re-fetched for the new context. This is required by the [static context paradigm ↗](https://openfeature.dev/specification/glossary/#static-context-paradigm) used by the OpenFeature web SDK, where context is set globally and providers are expected to re-evaluate when it changes.
* **At resolution time** — evaluations are served synchronously from the cache. No network request is made during `getBooleanValue`, `getStringValue`, etc.

## Setup

The following example initializes the provider with a set of pre-fetched flags and evaluates them in a browser application.

```js
import { OpenFeature } from "@openfeature/web-sdk";
import { FlagshipClientProvider } from "@cloudflare/flagship/web";

await OpenFeature.setProviderAndWait(
	new FlagshipClientProvider({
		appId: "<APP_ID>",
		accountId: "<ACCOUNT_ID>",
		authToken: "<API_TOKEN>",
		prefetchFlags: ["promo-banner", "dark-mode", "max-uploads"],
	}),
);

// Set evaluation context globally. The provider re-fetches all prefetchFlags
// whenever the context changes.
await OpenFeature.setContext({ targetingKey: "user-42", plan: "enterprise" });

const client = OpenFeature.getClient();

// Synchronous — served from the in-memory cache.
const showBanner = client.getBooleanValue("promo-banner", false);

if (showBanner) {
	document.getElementById("banner").style.display = "block";
}
```

```ts
import { OpenFeature } from "@openfeature/web-sdk";
import { FlagshipClientProvider } from "@cloudflare/flagship/web";

await OpenFeature.setProviderAndWait(
	new FlagshipClientProvider({
		appId: "<APP_ID>",
		accountId: "<ACCOUNT_ID>",
		authToken: "<API_TOKEN>",
		prefetchFlags: ["promo-banner", "dark-mode", "max-uploads"],
	}),
);

// Set evaluation context globally. The provider re-fetches all prefetchFlags
// whenever the context changes.
await OpenFeature.setContext({ targetingKey: "user-42", plan: "enterprise" });

const client = OpenFeature.getClient();

// Synchronous — served from the in-memory cache.
const showBanner = client.getBooleanValue("promo-banner", false);

if (showBanner) {
	document.getElementById("banner").style.display = "block";
}
```

Note

`getBooleanValue` on the client provider is synchronous and does not require `await`, unlike the [TypeScript server SDK](https://developers.cloudflare.com/flagship/sdk/server-provider/).

## Configuration options

| Option        | Type        | Required | Description                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------- | ----------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| appId         | string      | Yes      | The Flagship app ID from the Cloudflare dashboard.                                                                                           |
| accountId     | string      | Yes      | Your Cloudflare account ID.                                                                                                                  |
| authToken     | string      | Yes      | A Cloudflare [API token](https://developers.cloudflare.com/flagship/api-tokens/) with Flagship Evaluate or Flagship App Evaluate permission. |
| fetchOptions  | RequestInit | No       | Custom fetch options applied to HTTP requests.                                                                                               |
| timeout       | number      | No       | Request timeout in milliseconds. Defaults to 5000.                                                                                           |
| retries       | number      | No       | Retry attempts on transient errors. Defaults to 1 and is capped at 10.                                                                       |
| retryDelay    | number      | No       | Delay between retries in milliseconds. Defaults to 1000 and is capped at 30000.                                                              |
| prefetchFlags | string\[\]  | Yes      | Flag keys to fetch on initialization and on every context change. Flags not in this list return FLAG\_NOT\_FOUND at evaluation time.         |

## When to use the client provider

Use the client provider in browser applications, single-page apps, or any client-side JavaScript environment.

Evaluations are synchronous, so they do not block rendering. Flag values are fetched once during initialization and re-fetched whenever the evaluation context changes. To force a refresh, update the context via `OpenFeature.setContext(...)`.
