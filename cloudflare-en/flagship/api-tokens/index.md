# API tokens

Last updated Aug 26, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/flagship/api-tokens/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Flagship supports two kinds of API tokens. Both use the same [Create API token](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/get-started/create-token/) flow. The difference is the resource the permission policy applies to.

| Token type   | Resource                    | What it can access                |
| ------------ | --------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Account-wide | **Entire Account**          | Every Flagship app in the account |
| App-scoped   | **Specified Flagship apps** | Only the Flagship apps you select |

Use an account-wide token when a trusted server-side workflow needs access to every Flagship app. Use an app-scoped token when that workflow should only touch the apps you select — for example, CI or a backend service for one product.

Both token types support **Read**, **Write**, and **Evaluate**. The names change with the resource:

| Access                  | Account-wide          | App-scoped                |
| ----------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Evaluate flags          | **Flagship Evaluate** | **Flagship App Evaluate** |
| Read flag configuration | **Flagship Read**     | **Flagship App Read**     |
| Manage flags            | **Flagship Write**    | **Flagship App Write**    |

You must [create a Flagship app](https://developers.cloudflare.com/flagship/get-started/#create-an-app-and-a-flag) before you can create an app-scoped token. The dashboard can only list apps that already exist.

## Create an account-wide token

[Create an account-wide Flagship token ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/api-tokens) to open the Account API tokens page. Then create a custom token and leave the resource set to **Entire Account**.

To create the token yourself:

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Account API tokens** page.  
[Go to **Account API tokens** ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/api-tokens)  
You can also create a user token from [My Profile ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens) \> **API Tokens**.
2. Select **Create Token**.
3. Select **Create Custom Token** \> **Get started**.
4. Enter a token name.
5. Under **Permission policies**, leave the resource dropdown set to **Entire Account**.
6. Search for Flagship and select **Flagship Evaluate**, **Flagship Read**, or **Flagship Write**.
7. (Optional) Restrict the token with [IP address filtering or a TTL](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/how-to/restrict-tokens/).
8. Select **Review token** \> **Create Token**.
9. Copy the token secret and store it securely.

Warning

The token secret is **only shown once**. Do not store the secret in plaintext where others can access it. Anyone with this token can perform the authorized actions against the resources that the token has access to.

## Create an app-scoped token

[Create an app-scoped Flagship token ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/api-tokens&permissionGroupKeys=%5B%7B%22key%22:%22flagship%5Fapp%22,%22type%22:%22evaluate%22%7D%5D&scope=specified%5Fflagship%5Fapp) to open the token form with **Specified Flagship apps** and **Flagship App Evaluate** already selected. Then choose the app and create the token.

To create the token yourself:

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Account API tokens** page.  
[Go to **Account API tokens** ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/api-tokens)  
You can also create a user token from [My Profile ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens) \> **API Tokens**.
2. Select **Create Token**.
3. Select **Create Custom Token** \> **Get started**.
4. Enter a token name that describes where you will use it, such as `checkout-service-ci`.
5. Under **Permission policies**, open the resource dropdown (it defaults to **Entire Account**) and select **Specified Flagship apps**.
6. In **Select Flagship apps**, choose the app or apps this token should access.
7. Under **Developer Platform**, select a **Flagship App** permission:

| Use case                                      | Permission                |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Evaluate flags in the selected apps           | **Flagship App Evaluate** |
| Read flag configuration for the selected apps | **Flagship App Read**     |
| Manage flags in the selected apps             | **Flagship App Write**    |
8. (Optional) Restrict the token with [IP address filtering or a TTL](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/how-to/restrict-tokens/).
9. Select **Review token** \> **Create Token**.
10. Copy the token secret and store it securely.

Warning

The token secret is **only shown once**. Do not store the secret in plaintext where others can access it. Anyone with this token can perform the authorized actions against the resources that the token has access to.

## Use the token

Pass the token to an OpenFeature SDK as `authToken` (TypeScript) or the equivalent option in [Python](https://developers.cloudflare.com/flagship/sdk/python/) and [Go](https://developers.cloudflare.com/flagship/sdk/go/).

```ts
import { OpenFeature } from "@openfeature/server-sdk";
import { FlagshipServerProvider } from "@cloudflare/flagship/server";

await OpenFeature.setProviderAndWait(
	new FlagshipServerProvider({
		appId: "<APP_ID>",
		accountId: "<ACCOUNT_ID>",
		authToken: "<APP_SCOPED_API_TOKEN>",
	}),
);
```

Replace `<APP_ID>` and `<ACCOUNT_ID>` with the app and account the token is scoped to. An app-scoped token is rejected if you evaluate a different app.

Inside a Cloudflare Worker, prefer the [binding](https://developers.cloudflare.com/flagship/binding/). The binding authenticates automatically and does not need an API token.

## Next steps

* Set up the [TypeScript Server SDK](https://developers.cloudflare.com/flagship/sdk/server-provider/) outside of Workers.
* Restrict token use with [IP filtering or a TTL](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/how-to/restrict-tokens/).
