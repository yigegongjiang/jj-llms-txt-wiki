Flagship enforces the following limits.

## Platform limits

| Feature                         | Limit     |
| ------------------------------- | --------- |
| Apps per account                | 10,000    |
| Flags per app                   | 5,000     |
| Flag, app, and variant keys     | 64 chars  |
| Condition attribute names       | 64 chars  |
| Condition string values         | 256 chars |
| Variant value size              | 10 KB     |
| Condition nesting depth         | 5 levels  |
| Flag description                | 512 chars |
| Flag configuration size per app | 25 MB     |

Note

The apps-per-account and flags-per-app limits are soft limits. If your use case requires higher limits, contact Cloudflare support.

## Notes

* Condition nesting depth counts from the top-level condition group. A flat list of conditions (no nesting) has a depth of 1.
* Flag keys, app names, condition set names, and variant keys can contain letters, numbers, hyphens, and underscores.
* All variants on a flag must use the same value type: boolean, string, number, or JSON.
* Flag configuration size refers to the total serialized size of all flags within a single app, including their variants and rules.
