# Create Rate Limiting policies (beta)

Last updated Apr 17, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-network-firewall/how-to/create-rate-limiting-policies/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Rate limiting policies (beta) allow you to manage incoming traffic to your network for specific locations.

This guide will teach you how to create a policy for when incoming packets match, and in cases where your rate exceeds a certain value (in packets or bits).

Note

For Cloudflare Advanced Network Firewall customers, rate limiting (beta) is available by request through the account team.

## Add a policy

To add a policy:

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the [Firewall Policies ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/network-security/magic%5Ffirewall) page.
2. Select the **Rate limiting** tab, then select **Add a policy**.
3. Fill out the information for your new policy:  
  * Select the **Field**: At the moment, you can only choose a [colo name ↗](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/rules-language/fields/cloudflare-network-firewall/).
  * Select the **Operator**: Choose among **equals** or **is in**.
  * Select the **Value**.
4. When you are done, select **Save policy**.
