# Add custom policies

Last updated May 6, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-network-firewall/how-to/add-policies/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

By default, you can create a maximum of 200 policies. We recommend you create lists of IP addresses to reference within policies to streamline policy management.

## Add a policy

1. In the [Cloudflare One ↗](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com) dashboard, go to **Firewall policies** \> **Custom policies**.
2. Select **Add a policy**.
3. Fill out the information for your new policy. All existing policies apply to IPv4\. You can use a managed [IP list ↗](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/ips/) when populating the **Value**.
4. When you are done, select **Add new policy**.

## Create a disabled policy

When you add a new policy, the policy is **Enabled** by default.

To create a **Disabled** policy, follow the steps in [Add a policy](#add-a-policy) above and toggle **Enabled** to off. When a policy is in the disabled state, the policy will not perform the action until is set to **Enabled**.

To disable an existing policy, from the **Custom policies** tab, set the **Enabled** toggle to off.

## Update a policy

1. In the [Cloudflare One ↗](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com) dashboard, go to **Firewall policies** \> **Custom policies**.
2. Locate the policy you want to edit and select the three dots > **Edit**.
3. Update the policy with your changes and select **Save**.

## Delete an existing policy

1. Locate the policy you want to delete in the list.
2. From the end of the row, select **Delete**.
3. Select **Delete** again to confirm the deletion.

## API

Below, you can find examples of how to use the API to perform certain actions.

Warning

The examples on this page all use the `https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/{account_id}/rulesets` endpoint. This endpoint is intended to create policies from scratch and **might overwrite existing policies**.

If you have a ruleset already deployed, consider using the `https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/{account_id}/rulesets/{ruleset_id}/rules` endpoint instead.

Refer to [Add a rule to a ruleset](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/rulesets-api/add-rule/) and [Create an account ruleset](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/rulesets/methods/create/) for more information.

### Skip action

The example below blocks all TCP ports, but allows one port (`8080`) by using the skip action.

```bash
curl https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/{account_id}/rulesets \
--header "Authorization: Bearer <API_TOKEN>" \
--header "Content-Type: application/json" \
--data '{
  "name": "Example ruleset",
  "kind": "root",
  "phase": "magic_transit",
  "description": "Example ruleset description",
  "rules": [
    {
      "action": "skip",
      "action_parameters": { "ruleset": "current" },
      "expression": "tcp.dstport in { 8080 } ",
      "description": "Allow port 8080"
    },
    {
      "action": "block",
      "expression": "tcp.dstport in { 1..65535 }",
      "description": "Block all TCP ports"
    }
  ]
}'
```

### Block a country

The example below blocks all packets with a source or destination IP address coming from Brazil by using its 2-letter country code in [ISO 3166-1 Alpha 2 ↗](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#search/code/) format.

```bash
curl https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/{account_id}/rulesets \
--header "Authorization: Bearer <API_TOKEN>" \
--header "Content-Type: application/json" \
--data '{
  "name": "Example ruleset",
  "kind": "root",
  "phase": "magic_transit",
  "description": "Example ruleset description",
  "rules": [
    {
      "action": "block",
      "expression": "ip.src.country == \"BR\"",
      "description": "Block traffic from Brazil"
    }
  ]
}'
```

### Use an IP list

Cloudflare Network Firewall supports [using lists in expressions](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/tools/lists/use-in-expressions/) for the `ip.src` and `ip.dst` fields. The supported lists are:

* `$cf.anonymizer` \- Anonymizer proxies
* `$cf.botnetcc` \- Botnet command and control channel
* `$cf.malware` \- Sources of malware
* `$<IP_LIST_NAME>` \- The name of an account-level IP list

```bash
curl https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/{account_id}/rulesets \
--header "Authorization: Bearer <API_TOKEN>" \
--header "Content-Type: application/json" \
--data '{
  "name": "Example ruleset",
  "kind": "root",
  "phase": "magic_transit",
  "description": "Example ruleset description",
  "rules": [
    {
      "action": "block",
      "expression": "ip.src in $cf.anonymizer",
      "description": "Block traffic from anonymizer proxies"
    }
  ]
}'
```
