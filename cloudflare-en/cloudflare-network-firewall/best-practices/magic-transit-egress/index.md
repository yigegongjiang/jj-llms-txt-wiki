# Magic Transit egress

Last updated Apr 17, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-network-firewall/best-practices/magic-transit-egress/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

The suggestions in the [Minimal ruleset](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-network-firewall/best-practices/minimal-ruleset/) and [Extended ruleset](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-network-firewall/best-practices/extended-ruleset/) are recommendations for ingress traffic.

For Magic Transit egress traffic, consider the following information:

* The Cloudflare Network Firewall (formerly Magic Firewall) rules will apply to both Magic Transit ingress and egress traffic passing via Cloudflare.
* Network Firewall is not stateful for your Magic Transit egress traffic.
* Network Firewall is not stateful in both directions after DDoS mitigations.
* If you have a Network Firewall "default drop" catchall rule for ingress traffic, you will need to add an earlier rule to permit traffic sourced from your Magic Transit prefix with the destination as **any** to allow outbound egress traffic.
