Last updated May 7, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/network-error-logging/how-to/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Use NEL reports to view information such as:

* Why a request failed
* The country a request failed from
* The last mile network a request failed from
* The Cloudflare data center the request was most likely meant for
1. Log in to your Cloudflare dashboard.  
[Go to **Account home** ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/home)
2. Select **Analytics & Logs** \> **Edge Reachability**.

Click a tab under **Reachability summary** to view specific information related to your Origin ASN, Origin, IP, or data center. Hover over a location on the map to view the number of reachable requests.

Under **Reachability by data center**, click a location under Data Centers to filter reachability by a specific location.

To view the log fields available for NEL, refer to [NEL reports](https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/logpush/logpush-job/datasets/zone/nel%5Freports/).
