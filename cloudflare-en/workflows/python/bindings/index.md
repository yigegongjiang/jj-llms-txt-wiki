# Interact with a Workflow

Last updated Jul 6, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workflows/python/bindings/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Python Workflows are in beta, as well as the underlying platform.

You must add both `python_workflows` and `python_workers` compatibility flags to your Wrangler config file.

Also, Python Workflows requires `compatibility_date = "2025-08-01"`, or later, to be set in your Wrangler config file.

The Python Workers platform leverages [FFI ↗](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign%5Ffunction%5Finterface) to access bindings to Cloudflare resources. Refer to the [bindings](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/languages/python/ffi/#using-bindings-from-python-workers) documentation for more information.

From the configuration perspective, enabling Python Workflows requires adding the `python_workflows` compatibility flag to your Wrangler configuration file.

```jsonc
{
	"$schema": "./node_modules/wrangler/config-schema.json",
	"name": "workflows-starter",
	"main": "src/index.py",
	// Set this to today's date
	"compatibility_date": "2026-08-14",
	"compatibility_flags": ["python_workflows", "python_workers"],
	"workflows": [
		{
			// name of your workflow
			"name": "workflows-starter",
			// binding name env.MY_WORKFLOW
			"binding": "MY_WORKFLOW",
			// this is class that extends the Workflow class in src/index.py
			"class_name": "MyWorkflow",
		}
	]
}
```

```toml
"$schema" = "./node_modules/wrangler/config-schema.json"
name = "workflows-starter"
main = "src/index.py"
# Set this to today's date
compatibility_date = "2026-08-14"
compatibility_flags = [ "python_workflows", "python_workers" ]

[[workflows]]
name = "workflows-starter"
binding = "MY_WORKFLOW"
class_name = "MyWorkflow"
```

And this is how you use the payload in your workflow:

```python
from workers import WorkflowEntrypoint

class DemoWorkflowClass(WorkflowEntrypoint):
    async def run(self, event, step):
        @step.do('step-name')
        async def first_step():
            payload = event["payload"]
            return payload
```

## Workflow

The `Workflow` binding gives you access to the [Workflow](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workflows/build/workers-api/#workflow) class. All its methods are available on the binding.

### `create`

Create (trigger) a new instance of a given Workflow.

* `create(options=None)`\* `options` \- an **optional** dictionary of options to pass to the workflow instance. Should contain the same keys as the [WorkflowInstanceCreateOptions](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workflows/build/workers-api/#workflowinstancecreateoptions)type.

```python
from workers import WorkerEntrypoint, Response


class Default(WorkerEntrypoint):
    async def fetch(self, request):
        event = {"foo": "bar"}
        await self.env.MY_WORKFLOW.create(params=event)
        return Response.json({"status": "success"})
```

The `create` method returns a [WorkflowInstance](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workflows/build/workers-api/#workflowinstance) object, which can be used to query the status of the workflow instance. Note that this is a Javascript object, and not a Python object.

### `create_batch`

Create (trigger) a batch of new workflow instances, up to 100 instances at a time. This is useful if you need to create multiple instances at once within the [instance creation limit](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workflows/reference/limits/).

* `create_batch(batch)`\* `batch` \- list of `WorkflowInstanceCreateOptions` to pass when creating an instance, including a user-provided ID and payload parameters.

Each element of the `batch` list is expected to include both `id` and `params` properties:

```python
from workers import WorkerEntrypoint, Response

class Default(WorkerEntrypoint):
    async def fetch(self, request):
			# Create a new batch of 3 Workflow instances, each with its own ID and pass params to the Workflow instances
        instances = [
            {"id": "id-abc123", "params": {"hello": "world-0"}},
            {"id": "id-def456", "params": {"hello": "world-1"}},
            {"id": "id-ghi789", "params": {"hello": "world-2"}},
        ]
        await self.env.MY_WORKFLOW.create_batch(instances)
        return Response.json({"status": "success"})
```

### `get`

Get a workflow instance by ID.

* `get(id)`\* `id` \- the ID of the workflow instance to get.

Returns a [WorkflowInstance](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workflows/build/workers-api/#workflowinstance) object, which can be used to query the status of the workflow instance.

```python
from workers import WorkerEntrypoint, Response

class Default(WorkerEntrypoint):
    async def fetch(self, request):
        instance = await self.env.MY_WORKFLOW.get("abc-123")

        # FFI methods available for WorkflowInstance
        await instance.status()
        await instance.pause()
        await instance.resume()
        await instance.restart()
        await instance.terminate()
        return Response.json({"status": "success"})
```

### `send_event`

Send an event to a workflow instance.

* `send_event(type, payload)`\* `type` \- the type of event to send to the workflow instance. \* `payload` \- the payload to send to the workflow instance.

```python
from workers import WorkerEntrypoint, Response

class Default(WorkerEntrypoint):
    async def fetch(self, request):
        await self.env.MY_WORKFLOW.send_event(type="my-event-type", payload={"foo": "bar"})
        return Response.json({"status": "success"})
```

## REST API (HTTP)

Refer to the [Workflows REST API documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/workflows/subresources/instances/methods/create/).

## Command line (CLI)

Refer to the [CLI quick start](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workflows/get-started/guide/) to learn more about how to manage and trigger Workflows via the command-line.
