# Python Workflows SDK

Last updated Apr 22, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workflows/python/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Workflow entrypoints can be declared using Python. To achieve this, you can export a `WorkflowEntrypoint` that runs on the Cloudflare Workers platform. Refer to [Python Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/languages/python) for more information about Python on the Workers runtime.

Python Workflows are in beta, as well as the underlying platform.

Join the #python-workers channel in the [Cloudflare Developers Discord ↗](https://discord.cloudflare.com/) and let us know what you'd like to see next.

## Get Started

The main entrypoint for a Python workflow is the [WorkflowEntrypoint](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workflows/build/workers-api/#workflowentrypoint) class. Your workflow logic should exist inside the [run](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workflows/build/workers-api/#run) handler.

```python
from workers import WorkflowEntrypoint

class MyWorkflow(WorkflowEntrypoint):
    async def run(self, event, step):
        # steps here
```

For example, a Workflow may be defined as:

```python
from workers import Response, WorkflowEntrypoint, WorkerEntrypoint

class PythonWorkflowStarter(WorkflowEntrypoint):
    async def run(self, event, step):

        @step.do('step1')
        async def step_1():
            # does stuff
            print('executing step1')

        @step.do('step2')
        async def step_2():
            # does stuff
            print('executing step2')

        await step_1()
        await step_2()

class Default(WorkerEntrypoint):
    async def fetch(self, request):
        await self.env.MY_WORKFLOW.create()
        return Response("Hello world!")
```

You must add both `python_workflows` and `python_workers` compatibility flags to your Wrangler configuration file.

```jsonc
{
	"$schema": "./node_modules/wrangler/config-schema.json",
	"name": "hello-python",
	"main": "src/entry.py",
	"compatibility_flags": [
		"python_workers",
		"python_workflows"
	],
	// Set this to today's date
	"compatibility_date": "2026-08-28",
	"workflows": [
		{
			"name": "workflows-demo",
			"binding": "MY_WORKFLOW",
			"class_name": "PythonWorkflowStarter"
		}
	]
}
```

```toml
"$schema" = "./node_modules/wrangler/config-schema.json"
name = "hello-python"
main = "src/entry.py"
compatibility_flags = [ "python_workers", "python_workflows" ]
# Set this to today's date
compatibility_date = "2026-08-28"

[[workflows]]
name = "workflows-demo"
binding = "MY_WORKFLOW"
class_name = "PythonWorkflowStarter"
```

To run a Python Workflow locally, use [Wrangler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/), the CLI for Cloudflare Workers:

```bash
npx wrangler@latest dev
```

To deploy a Python Workflow to Cloudflare, run [wrangler deploy](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/commands/general/#deploy):

```bash
npx wrangler@latest deploy
```
