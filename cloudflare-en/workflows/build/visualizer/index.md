# Visualize Workflows

Last updated Apr 22, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workflows/build/visualizer/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

View a visual representation of your parsed Workflow code as a diagram on the Cloudflare dashboard.

The diagram illustrates your sequenced & parallel steps, conditionals, loops, and nested logic. To see the Workflow at a high level, view the diagram with loops and conditionals collapsed, or expand for a more detailed view.

Workflow diagrams are currently in beta for all Typescript and Javascript Workers. View your Workflows in the [Cloudflare dashboard ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/workers/workflows) to see their diagrams.

Caution

Note that this feature is currently in beta.

* Workflows that use a non-default bundler may display unexpected behavior.
* Python Workflows are not currently supported.

## Node types

The diagrams consist of the following node types:

| Node type        | Description                                                                   |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| StepSleep        | Pauses Workflow execution for a specified duration.                           |
| StepDo           | Represents a named, retriable step that wraps a unit of work.                 |
| StepWaitForEvent | Suspends execution until an external event is received.                       |
| StepSleepUntil   | Pauses Workflow execution until a specific date and time.                     |
| LoopNode         | Represents a loop construct (for, while, etc.) that repeats a block of logic. |
| ParallelNode     | Groups steps that execute concurrently, such as those inside Promise.all().   |
| TryNode          | Represents a try...catch block that handles errors within a Workflow.         |
| BlockNode        | Groups a sequence of steps into a logical block for display purposes.         |
| IfNode           | Represents a conditional branch based on an if/else expression.               |
| SwitchNode       | Represents a switch statement that routes execution across multiple cases.    |
| StartNode        | Marks the entry point of the Workflow or a function definition.               |
| FunctionCall     | Represents a call to a named function within the Workflow code.               |
| FunctionDef      | Represents the definition of a function used within the Workflow.             |
| BreakNode        | Represents a break statement that exits a loop early.                         |

## Execution order

Each node has a `starts` and `resolves` field that tracks execution order. These indices indicate when a promise began executing and when it ended, relative to the first promise that started without an immediate conclusion. This corresponds to vertical positioning in the diagram (i.e. all steps with `starts: 1` will appear inline).

When parsing, unawaited promises or `Promise.all()` calls are assigned an entry number stored in the `starts` field. When an `await` is encountered for that promise, the entry number is incremented and saved as the exit number in the `resolves` field. This allows the diagram to determine which promises run concurrently and when each will complete relative to the others.

If steps are awaited at the point of declaration, `starts` and `resolves` will be undefined, and the Workflow executes in the order the steps appear to the runtime.
