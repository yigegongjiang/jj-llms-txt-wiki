# Cloudflare bot solutions

Last updated Apr 30, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/bots/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Identify and mitigate automated traffic to protect your domain from bad bots.

Available on all plans

Bots — automated software that sends requests to your site — can scrape content, stuff stolen credentials into login forms, hoard inventory, and inflate server costs. Cloudflare's bot solutions detect this automated traffic and let you decide how to respond.

Cloudflare offers three bot-specific products: Bot Fight Mode, Super Bot Fight Mode, and Bot Management for Enterprise.

Note

Enterprise customers can preview this product as a [non-contract service](https://developers.cloudflare.com/billing/understand/preview-services/), which provides full access, free of metered usage fees, limits, and certain other restrictions.

## Which bot solution do I need?

If you need a simple toggle that challenges detected bots across your entire domain, use Bot Fight Mode (Free) or Super Bot Fight Mode (Pro, Business, Enterprise without Bot Management add-on). These products are included with your plan but do not allow you to write rules based on bot score or target specific endpoints. Super Bot Fight Mode adds configurable actions per bot category and supports WAF custom rule exceptions, but does not offer the granular per-request scoring of Bot Management.

If you need granular control — per-request bot scores, custom rules, per-endpoint handling, and detailed analytics — use Bot Management for Enterprise. This is recommended for ecommerce, banking, and security use cases. To enable Bot Management for Enterprise, contact your account team.
