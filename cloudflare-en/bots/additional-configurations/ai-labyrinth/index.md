# AI Labyrinth

Last updated Apr 22, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/bots/additional-configurations/ai-labyrinth/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

The AI Labyrinth adds invisible links on your webpage with specific `Nofollow` tags to block AI crawlers that do not adhere to the recommended guidelines and crawl without permission. AI crawlers that scrape your website content without permission will be stuck in a maze of never-ending links, and their details are recorded and used by all Cloudflare customers who choose to block [AI bots](https://developers.cloudflare.com/bots/concepts/bot/#ai-bots).

These links do not impact your search engine optimization (SEO) or your website's appearance, and are only seen by bots. AI bots that respect no-crawl instructions will safely ignore this honeypot.

To enable AI Labyrinth:

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Security Settings** page.  
[Go to **Settings** ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/:zone/security/settings)
2. Filter by **Bot traffic**.
3. Go to **AI Labyrinth**.
4. Turn **AI Labyrinth** on.

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/), and select your account and domain.
2. Go to **Security** \> **Bots**.
3. Select **Configure Bot Fight Mode**.
4. Enable **AI Labyrinth**.
