# Additional detections

Last updated Apr 15, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/bots/additional-configurations/detection-ids/additional-detections/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Cloudflare bot detection includes additional signals to catch different kinds of automated traffic.

Bot management customers automatically benefit from the residential proxy detection improvement below, which lowers the [bot score](https://developers.cloudflare.com/bots/concepts/bot-score/) for matched requests. Using the detection ID in [custom rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/custom-rules/) provides even more visibility and control over mitigating residential proxy traffic.

| Detection ID | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| 50331651     | Observes traffic from residential proxy networks and similar commercial proxies. When the ID matches a request, Bot Management sets the bot score to 29 and uses [anomaly detection](https://developers.cloudflare.com/bots/concepts/bot-detection-engines/#anomaly-detection-enterprise) as its score source. |
