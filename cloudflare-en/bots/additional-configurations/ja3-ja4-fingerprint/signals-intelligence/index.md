# Signals Intelligence

Last updated May 6, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/bots/additional-configurations/ja3-ja4-fingerprint/signals-intelligence/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Bot Management customers can view aggregate intelligence data for each [JA4 fingerprint](https://developers.cloudflare.com/bots/additional-configurations/ja3-ja4-fingerprint/) based on traffic across the Cloudflare network. Use this data to understand why a request received a specific bot score or to feed into your own machine learning models running in [Cloudflare Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/) or at your origin.

Specifically, for each JA4 fingerprint, you will be able to access the following information:

* The percentage of traffic associated with browsers that Cloudflare sees.
* The percentage of traffic associated with known bots that Cloudflare sees.
* The number of networks Cloudflare sees actively using this fingerprint.
* The number of Cloudflare sites that see traffic from this fingerprint.
* The frequency that fingerprint requests caches content and generates errors.

You can also use these fields with [Workers AI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/) to build custom machine learning models.

## Signals Intelligence fields

Signals Intelligence fields show observations about a particular JA4 that Cloudflare has seen globally over the last hour.

| Field name           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| h2h3\_ratio\_1h      | The ratio of HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 requests combined with the total number of requests for the JA4 fingerprint in the last hour. Higher values indicate a higher proportion of HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 requests compared to other protocol versions.        |
| heuristic\_ratio\_1h | The ratio of requests with a scoreSrc value of "heuristics" for the JA4 fingerprint in the last hour. Higher values suggest a larger proportion of requests being flagged by heuristic-based scoring.                                             |
| reqs\_quantile\_1h   | The quantile position of the JA4 fingerprint based on the number of requests across all fingerprints in the last hour. Higher values indicate a relatively higher number of requests compared to other fingerprints.                              |
| uas\_rank\_1h        | The rank of the JA4 fingerprint based on the number of distinct user agents across all fingerprints in the last hour. Lower values indicate a higher diversity of user agents associated with the fingerprint.                                    |
| browser\_ratio\_1h   | The ratio of requests originating from browser-based user agents for the JA4 fingerprint in the last hour. Higher values suggest a higher proportion of browser-based requests.                                                                   |
| paths\_rank\_1h      | The rank of the JA4 fingerprint based on the number of unique request paths across all fingerprints in the last hour. Lower values indicate a higher diversity of request paths associated with the fingerprint.                                  |
| reqs\_rank\_1h       | The rank of the JA4 fingerprint based on the number of requests across all fingerprints in the last hour. Lower values indicate a higher number of requests associated with the fingerprint.                                                      |
| cache\_ratio\_1h     | The ratio of cacheable responses for the JA4 fingerprint in the last hour. Higher values suggest a higher proportion of responses that can be cached.                                                                                             |
| ips\_rank\_1h        | The rank of the JA4 fingerprint based on the number of unique client IP addresses across all fingerprints in the last hour. Lower values indicate a higher number of distinct client IPs associated with the fingerprint.                         |
| ips\_quantile\_1h    | The quantile position of the JA4 fingerprint based on the number of unique client IP addresses across all fingerprints in the last hour. Higher values indicate a relatively higher number of distinct client IPs compared to other fingerprints. |

If you want to use JA4 fingerprints and Signals Intelligence, your Workers script must be able to handle the absence of any field in the array, including:

* The possibility that the JA4 fingerprint could be missing.
* The possibility that the `ja4Signals` array could be missing.
* Results with `NaN` or `Infinity` values will be excluded from the array.
