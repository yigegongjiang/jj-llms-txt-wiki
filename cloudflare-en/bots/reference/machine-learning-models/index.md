# Machine Learning models

Last updated May 5, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/bots/reference/machine-learning-models/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

## Enable auto-updates to the Machine Learning models

Cloudflare encourages Enterprise customers to enable auto-updates to its Machine Learning models to get the newest bot detection models as they are released.

To enable auto-updates:

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Security Settings** page.  
[Go to **Settings** ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/:zone/security/settings)
2. Filter by **Bot traffic**.
3. Go to **Bot Management**.
4. Under **Configurations**, select the edit icon for **Auto-updates to the Machine Learning Model** and turn it on.

### What will change

If you are on an older Machine Learning model, you will see a score change to requests scored by the **Machine Learning** source instantly. If you are already on the latest model, you will see changes only after a new Machine Learning model becomes the global default.

Customers will be notified via email and dashboard prior to a new Machine Learning model becoming the global default.

### Risks of not updating

By not updating to the latest version, you will be using a Machine Learning model no longer maintained or monitored by our engineering team. As Internet traffic changes and new trends evolve, scoring accuracy by older versions may degrade.

### Model versions and release notes

| Version | Release Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Launch Date |
