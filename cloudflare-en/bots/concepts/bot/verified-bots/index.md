# Verified bots

Last updated Jul 1, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/bots/concepts/bot/verified-bots/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

A Verified bot is a bot or agent that Cloudflare has confirmed is **transparent about who it is and what it does**: it represents itself honestly and does not abuse the access that honesty earns. Examples include search engine crawlers, monitoring services, and user-driven agents.

Being Verified means a bot or agent meets two bars:

1. **Honest self-identification** — it declares who it is deterministically, through a cryptographic [Web Bot Auth](https://developers.cloudflare.com/bots/reference/bot-verification/web-bot-auth/) signature, a published IP list with a stable user-agent, or reverse DNS.
2. **Non-abusive behavior** — it obeys `robots.txt` and crawl directives, maintains reasonable request rates, and has not been observed evading website owner preferences or attacking sites.

Signed agents are now Verified

As of July 1, 2026, the distinction between a Verified bot and a signed agent is expressed by a new metadata field tracked in [BotBase](https://developers.cloudflare.com/bots/botbase/): Direct versus Intermediary access, which tracks who can operate the bot.

## Classification

Note

These updated classifications reflect the new taxonomy of bots used in [BotBase](https://developers.cloudflare.com/bots/botbase/). They are not individual fields in WAF custom rules, but have backwards-compatible categories from the original taxonomy of Verified bots (see [Legacy categories](#legacy-categories) below).

Cloudflare classifies each tracked bot by its behavior — what the bot may do on your site. A single bot can have one or more of the following behaviors:

| Behavior                | Description                                                                    |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Search                  | Crawling to build search indexes or RAG databases.                             |
| Agent                   | User-directed agents visiting a page on behalf of a human.                     |
| Training                | Crawling to train or fine-tune models.                                         |
| Transact                | Checkout or other transaction actions on behalf of users.                      |
| Data Collection         | Price scraping, competitive intelligence gathering, and third-party analytics. |
| Security Testing        | Vulnerability scanning and penetration testing.                                |
| SEO                     | SEO crawling, site auditing, and accessibility checks.                         |
| Ads Verification        | Ad placement verification and ad fraud detection.                              |
| Social / Link Preview   | Link previews for social platforms and messaging apps.                         |
| Feed Fetching           | RSS readers, podcast aggregators, and news feed bots.                          |
| Monitoring & Operations | Uptime monitoring, webhooks, and health checks.                                |

Search, Agent, and Training are also available as managed presets you can act on across all plans. For more information, refer to [AI bots](https://developers.cloudflare.com/bots/concepts/bot/#ai-bots).

Cloudflare also labels every Verified bot or agent by how it is operated.

| Label            | Description                                                                                                                                          |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Direct**       | Operated by a single, narrow operator — usually on the operator's own infrastructure. Only that operator can send requests that present as this bot. |
| **Intermediary** | An agentic service that a wide range of end users can operate. The operator runs the software, but each action is initiated by a different end user. |

Because an **intermediary** acts on behalf of many different end users, the operator and the end user are not the same party. This introduces **transitive trust**: you may trust the intermediary operator, but not necessarily every end user driving it. Cloudflare is experimenting with forwarding information about the end user (using the `Forwarded` header defined in [RFC 7239 ↗](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc7239)) so that website owners can apply their preferences to the party ultimately responsible for a request.

## Becoming a Verified bot

You can request for your bot or agent to be added to Cloudflare's bots and agents directory by filling out an [online application ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/configurations/verified-bots) in the Cloudflare dashboard.

Once Cloudflare approves a Verified bot, it should appear in [BotBase](https://developers.cloudflare.com/bots/botbase/), shared through [Cloudflare Radar's bots and agents directory ↗](https://radar.cloudflare.com/verified-bots).

The bot must be Verified using one of the following validation methods:

* [Web Bot Auth](https://developers.cloudflare.com/bots/reference/bot-verification/web-bot-auth/)
* [IP validation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/bots/reference/bot-verification/ip-validation/)

### Breach of policy

If any of the requirements to validate are breached, a service will be removed from the global allowlist.

The following are examples of breaches of policy:

* Adding a set of IPs that are not solely used by Verified service.
* The service IPs are breached by an attacker.
* The service has vulnerabilities that have not been patched.
* A block of IPs not briefed on onboarding is added to the list.
* The disclosed purpose of the service does not reflect on the traffic.
* An AI Crawler that does not respect the crawl-delay directive in robots.txt.

## Legacy categories

## Availability

Historically, Verified bots have been excluded in default bot configurations across all plans. Now, all customers have the option to [configure AI bot policies](https://developers.cloudflare.com/bots/additional-configurations/block-ai-bots/) to define their block vs. allow expectations.
