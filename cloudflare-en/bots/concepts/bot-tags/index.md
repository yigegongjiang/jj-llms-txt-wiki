# Bot tags

Last updated Apr 15, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/bots/concepts/bot-tags/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Bot tags provide more detail about _why_ Cloudflare assigned a [bot score](https://developers.cloudflare.com/bots/concepts/bot-score/) to a request.

Use these tags to learn more about your bot traffic and better inform security settings.

Note

Bot tags are only available to Enterprise customers who have purchased Bot Management.

## Potential values

Once you [enable bot tags](#enable-bot-tags), you can see more information about bot requests, such as whether a request came from a verified bot (like Bing) or a category of verified bot (like SearchEngine).

The following values are **examples** of what may be present in the `BotTags` log field, but not an exhaustive list:

* api
* google
* bing
* googleAds
* googleMedia
* googleImageProxy
* pinterest
* newRelic
* baidu
* apple
* yandex

## Enable bot tags

To enable bot tags, include the `BotTags` log field when using our [Logpush service](https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/logpush/).

## Limitations

Currently, bot tags are only available in log fields.

Future work will add more values and extend bot tags to other Cloudflare products.
