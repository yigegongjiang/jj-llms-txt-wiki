# Applications with integrated SSO

Last updated Apr 23, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/learning-paths/clientless-access/migrate-applications/integrated-sso/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Many organizations in the past few years have recognized the importance of source-of-truth identity and have directly integrated their SSO provider with their internal applications. The SSO provider is only aware of the internal domain on which the application exists (via the configured ACS URL), which means the user must be connected to the local network in order to access the application. This security architecture makes sense for a traditional network perimeter, but it presents challenges for Zero Trust adoption. In the clientless access model, the user's device has no concept of an internal corporate network, only the specific, scoped applications to which they have access. The problem is summarized in the following diagram:

app.internal.com")-->E("404 error

app.internal.com")

## Potential solutions

If your applications use integrated SSO, there are a number of different paths you can take to onboard your applications to Cloudflare Access.

## Recommended solution

If you are able to configure your SSO provider, we recommend presenting all internal web services exclusively on Cloudflare domains. This is the model that Cloudflare takes for web application access internally and the most common method of resolution for customers in this scenario.

With this approach, you do not need to make any changes to your existing DNS infrastructure. Cloudflare Tunnel in your network will manage the translation from external (Cloudflare public) DNS to internal DNS, which is how the system is designed to function. After you update the ACS URL in your SSO provider to the Cloudflare public hostname, the outcome will look like this:

flowchart LR
accTitle: Authorization flow with updated SSO ACS URL
A("User goes to
app.public.com")-->B("Cloudflare Tunnel
routes public hostname (app.public.com)
to internal domain (app.internal.com)")-->C("app.internal.com redirects
to integrated SSO")-->D("SSO ACS URL returns
app.public.com")-->E("Browser displays app.public.com")

All users - whether in the office, remote, using or not using the VPN client - will always route through the Cloudflare Access authentication flow at `app.public.com` to access a private application. This provides a single control plane for policy application and security audits, and no additional user training is necessary.
