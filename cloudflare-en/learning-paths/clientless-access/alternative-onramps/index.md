# Alternative on-ramps

Last updated Apr 23, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/learning-paths/clientless-access/alternative-onramps/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

As discussed in the previous modules, almost everything you do with the Cloudflare reverse proxy requires [adding a site](https://developers.cloudflare.com/learning-paths/clientless-access/initial-setup/add-site/) to Cloudflare. That public DNS record (or its subdomains) becomes the domain on which your users access your private applications. This method is exceptionally secure and transparent; each domain and subdomain has access to the Cloudflare web security portfolio, are inherently DDoS protected, and receive an obfuscated origin IP. For these reasons, using a [public hostname on Cloudflare](https://developers.cloudflare.com/learning-paths/clientless-access/connect-private-applications/) is the recommended method to onboard applications for clientless user access. However, there may be times in which a public DNS record cannot be created, or other situations that prevent administrators from using this method.

## Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

* Connect to private web applications using their private hostnames.
