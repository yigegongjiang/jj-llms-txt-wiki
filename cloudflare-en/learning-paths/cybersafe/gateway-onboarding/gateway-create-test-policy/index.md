# Create a test policy

Last updated Apr 23, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/learning-paths/cybersafe/gateway-onboarding/gateway-create-test-policy/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

To ensure a smooth deployment, we recommend testing a simple policy before deploying DNS filtering to your organization.

## Test a policy in the browser

1. Go to **Traffic policies** \> **Firewall policies**.
2. Create a policy to block all security categories:  

| Selector            | Operator | Value                | Action |
| ------------------- | -------- | -------------------- | ------ |
| Security Categories | in       | _All security risks_ | Block  |
3. In the browser, go to `malware.testcategory.com`. You should see a generic Gateway block page.
4. In **Logs** \> **Gateway** \> **DNS**, verify that you see the blocked domain.

Note

When testing against frequently-visited sites, you may need to [clear the DNS cache](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/traffic-policies/dns-policies/test-dns-filtering/#clear-dns-cache) in your browser or OS. Otherwise, the DNS lookup will return the locally-cached IP address and bypass your DNS policies.

You have now validated DNS filtering!
