# Create CIPA policy

Last updated Apr 23, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/learning-paths/cybersafe/gateway-onboarding/gateway-create-cipa-policy/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

## Create CIPA policy

1. Go to **Traffic policies** \> **Firewall policies**.
2. Create a policy to block using the CIPA filter:

| Selector           | Operator | Value         | Action |
| ------------------ | -------- | ------------- | ------ |
| Content Categories | in       | _CIPA Filter_ | Block  |
3. In **Logs** \> **Gateway** \> **DNS**, verify that you see the blocked domain.

Your environment is now protected against all of the subcategories listed in [Configuration](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/reference/policies-compliances/cybersafe/#configuration).
