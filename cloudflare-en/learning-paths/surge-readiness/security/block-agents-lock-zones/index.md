# Block user agents and lock zones

Last updated Apr 23, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/learning-paths/surge-readiness/security/block-agents-lock-zones/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

[User Agent (UA) Blocking](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/tools/user-agent-blocking/) rules match against specific User-Agent request headers sent by the browser or application accessing your site. UA rules are applied against the entire domain, and after a rule is triggered, you can decide which action to take against the visitor.

Actions:

* Block: Ensures that an IP address will never be allowed to access your site
* Interactive Challenge: Visitors will be shown an interactive challenge before allowed access
* Non-Interactive Challenge: Visitors will be shown a non-interactive challenge before allowed access

## Zone Lockdown

[Zone Lockdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/tools/zone-lockdown/) rules allow you to define paths and only allow specific, trusted IPs to those paths. Any requests to those paths from non-whitelisted IPs will be automatically blocked with an 1106 HTTP code. This ability is particularly useful for locking down administrative or staging portions of your application.
