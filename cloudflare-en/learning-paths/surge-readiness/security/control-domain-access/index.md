# Control domain access

Last updated Apr 23, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/learning-paths/surge-readiness/security/control-domain-access/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

[IP Access Rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/tools/ip-access-rules/) specify an action based on the origin of your user across a single domain or all of the domains in your account.

IP Access Rules can be applied based on:

* IPv4 address or range: Specified in CIDR notation as `/16` or `/24`
* IPv6 address or range: Specified in CIDR notation as `/32`, `/48`, `/64`
* ASN
* Country or the Tor network

Note

We recommend locking down your origin with an Access Control List (ACL) which only allows [Cloudflare IPs ↗](http://www.cloudflare.com/ips).

Actions:

* Block: Ensures that an IP address will never be allowed to access your site.
* Non-Interactive Challenge: Visitors will be shown a non-interactive challenge before allowed access.
* Interactive Challenge: Visitors will be shown an interactive challenge before allowed access.
* Allowlist: Ensures that an IP address will never be blocked from accessing your site. This supersedes any Cloudflare security profile.
