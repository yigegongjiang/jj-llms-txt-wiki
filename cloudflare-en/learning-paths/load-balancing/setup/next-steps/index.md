# Next steps

Last updated Apr 23, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/learning-paths/load-balancing/setup/next-steps/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Your load balancer should be receiving production traffic (and you can confirm this by reviewing the [analytics](https://developers.cloudflare.com/load-balancing/reference/load-balancing-analytics/)).

Though your product is officially set up, you may want to consider the following suggestions.

## Usage-based notifications

Since this is a service with [usage-based billing](https://developers.cloudflare.com/billing/understand/usage-based-billing/), Cloudflare recommends that you set up usage-based billing notifications to avoid unexpected bills.

To set up those notifications:

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Notifications** page.  
[Go to **Notifications** ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/notifications)
2. On **Alert Type** of **Usage Based Billing**, click **Select**.
3. Fill out the following information:

  * **Name**
  * **Product**
  * **Notification limit** (exact metric will vary based on product)
  * **Notification email**  
Note  
Some plans also have access to alerts through [PagerDuty](https://developers.cloudflare.com/notifications/get-started/configure-pagerduty/) and [Webhooks](https://developers.cloudflare.com/notifications/get-started/configure-webhooks/).
4. Select **Save**.

## Additional configuration options

You may want to further customize how your load balancer routes traffic or integrate your load balancer with other Cloudflare products:

* [Cloudflare Tunnel (published applications)](https://developers.cloudflare.com/load-balancing/additional-options/cloudflare-tunnel/)
* [Spectrum](https://developers.cloudflare.com/load-balancing/additional-options/spectrum/)
* [Perform planned maintenance](https://developers.cloudflare.com/load-balancing/additional-options/planned-maintenance/)
* [Load shedding](https://developers.cloudflare.com/load-balancing/additional-options/load-shedding/)
* [DNS persistence](https://developers.cloudflare.com/load-balancing/additional-options/dns-persistence/)
* [Load Balancing with the China Network](https://developers.cloudflare.com/load-balancing/additional-options/load-balancing-china/)
* [Override HTTP Host headers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/load-balancing/additional-options/override-http-host-headers/)
* [CNAME flattening for endpoints](https://developers.cloudflare.com/load-balancing/additional-options/cname-flattening/)
* [Custom load balancing rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/load-balancing/additional-options/load-balancing-rules/)
* [Integrate with PagerDuty](https://developers.cloudflare.com/load-balancing/additional-options/pagerduty-integration/)
* [Additional DNS records](https://developers.cloudflare.com/load-balancing/additional-options/additional-dns-records/)
