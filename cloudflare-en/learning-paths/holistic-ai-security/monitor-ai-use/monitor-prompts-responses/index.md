# Monitor prompts and responses

Last updated Apr 23, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/learning-paths/holistic-ai-security/monitor-ai-use/monitor-prompts-responses/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

When you enable [TLS decryption](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/traffic-policies/http-policies/tls-decryption/#turn-on-tls-decryption), you can review the prompts and responses for supported AI applications. This allows you to understand three key things about AI application usage:

* The sanctioned and unsanctioned AI tools your users are engaging with.
* How they are interacting with them.
* What information they are sharing.

You can use this in conjunction with [DLP profiles](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/data-loss-prevention/dlp-profiles/) to detect sensitive data potentially being used in prompts, with or without explicitly blocking the action. You can use DLP to log AI prompt topics by turning on [Capture generative AI prompt content in logs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/data-loss-prevention/dlp-policies/logging-options/#turn-on-ai-prompt-content-logging-for-a-dlp-policy) for the policy.
