# Choose a connection method

Last updated May 6, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/learning-paths/replace-vpn/connect-private-network/connection-methods/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

There are [multiple ways](https://developers.cloudflare.com/reference-architecture/architectures/sase/#connecting-networks) to onramp traffic from your private networks to Cloudflare. This page covers the two software-based methods commonly used for VPN replacement: Cloudflare Mesh and Cloudflare Tunnel. Both involve installing lightweight software on a host machine in your network to create a secure connection to Cloudflare's global network.

## Cloudflare Mesh

[Cloudflare Mesh](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-mesh/) (formerly WARP Connector) runs the Cloudflare One Client (`warp-cli`) in headless mode on a Linux server. It operates as a Layer 3 proxy, supports bidirectional traffic (TCP, UDP, ICMP), and assigns a private Mesh IP to every participant. Use Mesh when you need:

* User-to-network access (replacing a VPN)
* Network-to-network / site-to-site connectivity
* Server-initiated connections (VoIP, SIP, AD updates, SCCM, DevOps)
* Client-to-client connectivity between enrolled devices

## Cloudflare Tunnel

[Cloudflare Tunnel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-tunnel/) runs the `cloudflared` daemon on a host machine. It creates an outbound-only connection and proxies traffic from Cloudflare to your internal applications or network. Use Tunnel when you need:

* Publishing specific applications by hostname
* Outbound-only connectivity (no inbound ports opened)
* Proxying HTTP/S, TCP, or SSH traffic to specific services
* Running on non-Linux platforms (macOS, Windows)

| Connection handling   | End-to-end — preserves long-lived TCP connections across the full path | Proxied — TCP connections are terminated and re-established at Cloudflare, which can interrupt long-lived sessions (for example, SAP transactions, database replication streams, or persistent RDP sessions may drop when cloudflared reconnects) |

## Recommendation

For most VPN replacement scenarios, [Cloudflare Tunnel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/learning-paths/replace-vpn/connect-private-network/cloudflared/) is the easiest way to get started. It runs on all platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows, containers, Raspberry Pi), does not require return route configuration (traffic is source-NATed to the `cloudflared` host), and does not interfere with existing VPN software on the same machine.

Use [Cloudflare Mesh](https://developers.cloudflare.com/learning-paths/replace-vpn/connect-private-network/cloudflare-mesh/) when you need bidirectional connectivity with server-initiated traffic (VoIP, SIP, AD updates, SCCM), site-to-site networking between multiple locations, deployments where preserving the original source IP is important, or workloads with long-lived TCP connections sensitive to interruptions (SAP, database replication, ERP systems).

Both methods can be used together. For example, use Tunnel for straightforward user-to-application access and add Mesh nodes where you need bidirectional or site-to-site connectivity.
