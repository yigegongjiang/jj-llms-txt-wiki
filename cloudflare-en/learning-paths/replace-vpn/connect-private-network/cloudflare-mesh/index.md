# Connect with Cloudflare Mesh

Last updated Apr 27, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/learning-paths/replace-vpn/connect-private-network/cloudflare-mesh/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

[Cloudflare Mesh](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-mesh/) (formerly WARP Connector) connects your private networks to Cloudflare using the Cloudflare One Client (`warp-cli`) running in headless mode on a Linux server. Every enrolled device and node receives a private Mesh IP and can communicate with any other participant over TCP, UDP, or ICMP.

Mesh supports bidirectional traffic — devices can reach servers, servers can reach devices, and networks can reach other networks. This makes it the recommended approach for replacing a VPN, as it covers both user-to-network and network-to-network connectivity.

## Set up Cloudflare Mesh

To connect your private network using Cloudflare Mesh, refer to [Get started with Cloudflare Mesh](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-mesh/get-started/).

The setup wizard in the dashboard configures enrollment, device profiles, and connectivity settings automatically. Once a node is online, add [CIDR routes](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-mesh/routes/) to make the subnet behind it reachable from any enrolled device.

## When to use Mesh

* Replacing a VPN for remote access to private networks
* Bidirectional connectivity (VoIP, SIP, Active Directory, SCCM, DevOps pipelines)
* Long-lived TCP connections sensitive to interruptions (SAP, database replication, ERP systems, RDP sessions)
* Site-to-site networking between offices, data centers, or cloud VPCs
* Client-to-client connectivity (two laptops reaching each other by private IP)
* Any L3/L4 workload where source IP preservation matters

## Best practices

* Enable [high availability](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-mesh/high-availability/) for production nodes with CIDR routes.
* Use [Gateway network policies](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/traffic-policies/network-policies/) to control which users and devices can reach specific resources.
* Refer to [Tips and best practices](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-mesh/tips/) for cloud VPC configuration and running alongside Cloudflare Tunnel.
