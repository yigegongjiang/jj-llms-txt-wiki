# Manage your active directory

Last updated Apr 23, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/learning-paths/secure-your-email/configure-email-security/active-directory-sync/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Directories are folders to store user data. Email security allows you to manage directories from the Cloudflare dashboard.

### Manage your Microsoft 365 directory

To manage your Microsoft 365 directory:

1. Log in to [Zero Trust  ↗](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/).
2. Select **Email security**.
3. Select **Directories**.
4. Under **Directory name**, select **MS directory**.
5. From here, you can manage **Groups** or **Users** directories.

### Manage your Google Workspace directory

To manage your Google Workspace Directory:

1. Log in to [Zero Trust  ↗](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/).
2. Select **Email security**.
3. Select **Directories**.
4. Under **Directory name**, select **Google Workspace Directory**.
5. From here, you can manage **Groups** or **Users** directories.

Email security allows you to view and manage your groups directory and their [impersonation registry](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/email-security/settings/detection-settings/impersonation-registry/). When a group is added to the registry, all members are registered by default.

To manage your group directory, select your directory, then select the **Groups** tab.

To add a single group to the registry:

1. Select the group name you want to add.
2. Select the three dots > **Add to registry**.

To add multiple groups to the registry at once:

1. Select the group names you want to add to the registry.
2. Select the **Action** dropdown list.
3. Select **Add to registry**.

In addition, Email security allows you to:

* [Remove groups from the registry](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/email-security/directories/manage-integrated-directories/manage-groups-directory/#remove-groups-from-registry).
* [Filter the impersonation registry](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/email-security/directories/manage-integrated-directories/manage-groups-directory/#filter-impersonation-registry).
* [Manage users in your directory](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/email-security/directories/manage-integrated-directories/manage-users-directory/).
