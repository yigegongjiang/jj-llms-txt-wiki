Last updated Apr 23, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/learning-paths/secure-your-email/configure-email-security/report-phish/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Before deploying Email security to production, you will have to consider reporting any phishing attacks, evaluating which disposition to assign a specific message, and using different screen criteria to search through your inbox.
