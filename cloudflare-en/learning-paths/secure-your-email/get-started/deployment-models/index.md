# Deployment models

Last updated Apr 23, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/learning-paths/secure-your-email/get-started/deployment-models/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Email security offers multiple deployment models:

* API for Microsoft 365 users.
* BCC for Google Workspace users.
* MX/Inline for all email providers.

When you choose the [API deployment](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/email-security/setup/post-delivery-deployment/api/), Email security can both scan and take actions on emails after they have reached a user's inbox.

If you are a Google Workspace user, you can enable Email security via [BCC setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/email-security/setup/post-delivery-deployment/bcc-journaling/bcc-setup/gmail-bcc-setup/gmail-bcc-setup/). Email security scans a copy of your email after it lands in your inbox.

With MX/Inline, Email security scans your email before they land in your inbox, giving you the highest level of protection.

Refer to [Before you begin](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/email-security/setup/) for a comprehensive comparison of each deployment method, and [Understanding Email Security Deployments](https://developers.cloudflare.com/reference-architecture/architectures/email-security-deployments/) to learn about each deployment method.
