# Define Split Tunnel settings

Last updated Apr 23, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/learning-paths/secure-internet-traffic/configure-device-agent/split-tunnel-settings/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Split tunnel settings determine which traffic the Cloudflare One Client does and does not proxy.

The Cloudflare One Client offers two different split tunnel modes:

* If you intend to send all internal and external destination traffic through Cloudflare's global network, opt for **Exclude IPs and domains** mode. This mode will proxy everything through the WARP tunnel with the exception of IPs and hosts defined explicitly within the Split Tunnel list.
* If you intend to only use the Cloudflare One Client to proxy private destination traffic, you can operate in **Include IPs and domains** mode, in which you explicitly define which IP ranges and domains should be included in the WARP routing table.

## Update Split Tunnels mode

To change your Split Tunnels mode:

1. In the [Cloudflare dashboard ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/), go to **Zero Trust** \> **Team & Resources** \> **Devices** \> **Device profiles** \> **General profiles**.
2. Locate the [device profile](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/cloudflare-one-client/configure/device-profiles/) you would like to modify and select **Configure**.
3. Scroll down to **Split Tunnels**.
4. (Optional) To view your existing Split Tunnel configuration, select **Manage**. You will see a list of the IPs and domains Cloudflare Zero Trust excludes or includes, depending on the mode you have selected. We recommend making a copy of your Split Tunnel entries, as they will revert to the default upon switching modes.
5. Under **Split Tunnels**, choose a mode:  
  * **Exclude IPs and domains** — (Default) All traffic will be sent to Cloudflare Gateway except for the IPs and domains you specify.
  * **Include IPs and Domains** — Only traffic destined to the IPs or domains you specify will be sent to Cloudflare Gateway. All other traffic will bypass Gateway and will no longer be filtered by your network or HTTP policies. In order to use certain features, you will need to manually add [Zero Trust domains](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/cloudflare-one-client/configure/route-traffic/split-tunnels/#cloudflare-zero-trust-domains).

1. Add the following permission to your [cloudflare\_api\_token ↗](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/cloudflare/cloudflare/latest/docs/resources/api%5Ftoken):

  * `Zero Trust Write`
2. Choose a [cloudflare\_zero\_trust\_device\_default\_profile ↗](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/cloudflare/cloudflare/latest/docs/resources/zero%5Ftrust%5Fdevice%5Fdefault%5Fprofile) or [cloudflare\_zero\_trust\_device\_custom\_profile ↗](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/cloudflare/cloudflare/latest/docs/resources/zero%5Ftrust%5Fdevice%5Fcustom%5Fprofile) resource to modify, or [create a new device profile](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/cloudflare-one-client/configure/device-profiles/#create-a-new-profile).
3. In your device profile, configure either the `exclude` or `include` argument. You cannot set both `exclude` and `include` in a given device profile.  
a. To manage Split Tunnel routes in **Exclude** mode, use the `exclude` argument:  
```tf  
resource "cloudflare_zero_trust_device_custom_profile" "exclude_example" {  
	account_id            = var.cloudflare_account_id  
	name                  = "Custom profile in Split Tunnels Exclude mode"  
	enabled               = true  
	precedence            = 101  
	service_mode_v2       = {mode = "warp"}  
	match 								=  "identity.email == \"test@cloudflare.com\""  
	exclude = [{  
			address = "10.0.0.0/8"  
			description = "Example route to exclude from WARP tunnel"  
	}]  
}  
```  
In this example, all traffic will be sent to Cloudflare Gateway except for traffic destined to `10.0.0.0/8`. To exclude the default IPs and domains recommended by Cloudflare, refer to [Add a route](#add-a-route).  
b. To manage Split Tunnel routes in **Include** mode, use the `include` argument:  
```tf  
resource "cloudflare_zero_trust_device_custom_profile" "include_example" {  
	account_id            = var.cloudflare_account_id  
	name                  = "Custom profile in Split Tunnels Include mode"  
	enabled               = true  
	precedence            = 101  
	service_mode_v2       = {mode = "warp"}  
	match 								=  "identity.email == \"test@cloudflare.com\""  
	include = [{  
			address = "10.0.0.0/8"  
			description = "Example route to include in WARP tunnel"  
	}]  
}  
```  
In this example, only traffic destined to `10.0.0.0/8` will be sent to Cloudflare Gateway.

All clients with this device profile will now switch to the new mode and its default route configuration. Next, [add](#add-a-route) or [remove](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/cloudflare-one-client/configure/route-traffic/split-tunnels/#remove-a-route) routes from your Split Tunnel configuration.

## Add a route

1. In the [Cloudflare dashboard ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/), go to **Zero Trust** \> **Team & Resources** \> **Devices** \> **Device profiles** \> **General profiles**.
2. Locate the [device profile](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/cloudflare-one-client/configure/device-profiles/) you would like to modify and select **Configure**.
3. Under **Split Tunnels**, check whether your [Split Tunnels mode](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/cloudflare-one-client/configure/route-traffic/split-tunnels/#change-split-tunnels-mode) is set to **Exclude** or **Include**.
4. Select **Manage**.
5. You can exclude or include routes based on either their IP address or domain. When possible we recommend adding an IP address instead of a domain. To learn about the consequences of adding a domain, refer to [Domain-based Split Tunnels](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/cloudflare-one-client/configure/route-traffic/split-tunnels/#domain-based-split-tunnels).  
To add an IP address to Split Tunnels:

  1. Select _IP Address_.
  2. Enter the IP address or CIDR you want to exclude or include.
  3. Select **Save destination**.  
Traffic to this IP address is now excluded or included from the WARP tunnel.  
Note  
If you would like to exclude a specific IP range from a larger IP range, you can use this calculator:  
Base CIDRSubtracted CIDRs  
Calculate  
To add a domain to Split Tunnels:

  1. Select _Domain_.
  2. Enter a [valid domain](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/cloudflare-one-client/configure/route-traffic/split-tunnels/#valid-domains) to exclude or include.
  3. Select **Save destination**.
  4. (Optional) If your domain does not have a public DNS record, create a [Local Domain Fallback](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/cloudflare-one-client/configure/route-traffic/local-domains/) entry to allow a private DNS server to handle domain resolution.  
When a user goes to the domain, the domain gets resolved according to your Local Domain Fallback configuration (either by Gateway or by your private DNS server). Split Tunnels will then dynamically include or exclude the IP address returned in the DNS lookup.

1. Add the following permission to your [cloudflare\_api\_token ↗](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/cloudflare/cloudflare/latest/docs/resources/api%5Ftoken):

  * `Zero Trust Write`
2. Choose a [cloudflare\_zero\_trust\_device\_default\_profile ↗](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/cloudflare/cloudflare/latest/docs/resources/zero%5Ftrust%5Fdevice%5Fdefault%5Fprofile) or [cloudflare\_zero\_trust\_device\_custom\_profile ↗](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/cloudflare/cloudflare/latest/docs/resources/zero%5Ftrust%5Fdevice%5Fcustom%5Fprofile) resource to modify, or [create a new device profile](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/cloudflare-one-client/configure/device-profiles/#create-a-new-profile).
3. (Optional) Create a list of split tunnel routes that you can reuse across multiple device profiles. For example, you can declare a local value in the same module as your device profiles:  
```tf  
locals {  
	global_exclude_list = [  
		# Default Split Tunnel entries recommended by Cloudflare  
		{  
			address     = "ff05::/16"  
		},  
		{  
			address     = "ff04::/16"  
		},  
		{  
			address     = "ff03::/16"  
		},  
		{  
			address     = "ff02::/16"  
		},  
		{  
			address     = "ff01::/16"  
		},  
		{  
			address     = "fe80::/10"  
			description = "IPv6 Link Local"  
		},  
		{  
			address     = "fd00::/8"  
		},  
		{  
			address     = "255.255.255.255/32"  
			description = "DHCP Broadcast"  
		},  
		{  
			address     = "240.0.0.0/4"  
		},  
		{  
			address     = "224.0.0.0/24"  
		},  
		{  
			address     = "192.168.0.0/16"  
		},  
		{  
			address     = "192.0.0.0/24"  
		},  
		{  
			address     = "172.16.0.0/12"  
		},  
		{  
			address     = "169.254.0.0/16"  
			description = "DHCP Unspecified"  
		},  
		{  
			address     = "100.64.0.0/10"  
		},  
		{  
			address     = "10.0.0.0/8"  
		}  
	]  
}  
```
4. In the device profile, exclude or include routes based on either their IP address or domain:  
```tf  
resource "cloudflare_zero_trust_device_custom_profile" "example" {  
	account_id            = var.cloudflare_account_id  
	name                  = "Example custom profile with split tunnels"  
	enabled               = true  
	precedence            = 101  
	service_mode_v2       = {mode = "warp"}  
	match                 =  "identity.email == \"test@cloudflare.com\""  
	exclude = concat(  
		# Global entries  
		local.global_exclude_list,  
		# Profile-specific entries  
		[  
			{  
				address = "192.0.2.0/24"  
				description = "Example IP to exclude from WARP"  
			},  
			{  
				host = "example.com"  
				description = "Example domain to exclude from WARP"  
			}  
		]  
	)  
}  
```  
When possible we recommend adding an IP address instead of a domain. To learn about the consequences of adding a domain, refer to [Domain-based Split Tunnels](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/cloudflare-one-client/configure/route-traffic/split-tunnels/#domain-based-split-tunnels).

It may take up to 10 minutes for newly updated settings to propagate to devices.

We recommend keeping the Split Tunnels list short, as each entry takes time for the client to parse. In particular, domains are slower to action than IP addresses because they require on-the-fly IP lookups and routing table / local firewall changes. A shorter list will also make it easier to understand and debug your configuration. For information on device profile limits, refer to [Account limits](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/account-limits/#warp).
