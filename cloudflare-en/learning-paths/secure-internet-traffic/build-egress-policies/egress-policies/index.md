# Use egress policies to deliver consistent egress IPs

Last updated May 1, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/learning-paths/secure-internet-traffic/build-egress-policies/egress-policies/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Note

Only available on Enterprise plans.

Egress policies allow you to determine whether your organization's traffic egresses via the default Cloudflare IP or via a [dedicated egress IP](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/traffic-policies/egress-policies/dedicated-egress-ips/) assigned to your account.

To create a new egress policy:

1. In the [Cloudflare dashboard ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/), go to **Zero Trust** \> **Traffic policies** \> **Egress policies**.
2. Select **Add a policy**.
3. Name the policy.
4. Build a logical expression that defines the traffic you want to control egress for. For example, you can add a policy to configure all traffic destined for a third-party network to use a static source IP:

| Policy name                 | Selector       | Operator | Value          | Egress method                   |
| --------------------------- | -------------- | -------- | -------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Access third-party provider | Destination IP | is       | 198.51.100.158 | Dedicated Cloudflare egress IPs |

| Primary IPv4 address | IPv6 address  |
| -------------------- | ------------- |
| 203.0.113.88         | 2001:db8::/32 |
5. Select **Create policy**.
