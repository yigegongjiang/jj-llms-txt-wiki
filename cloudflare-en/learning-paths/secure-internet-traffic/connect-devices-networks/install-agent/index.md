# Download and install the Cloudflare One Client

Last updated Apr 23, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/learning-paths/secure-internet-traffic/connect-devices-networks/install-agent/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Most admins test by manually downloading the Cloudflare One Client and enrolling in your organization's Cloudflare Zero Trust instance.

## Install the Cloudflare One Client

1. First, uninstall any existing third-party VPN software if possible. Sometimes products placed in a disconnected or disabled state will still interfere with the Cloudflare One Client.
2. If you are running third-party firewall or TLS decryption software, verify that it does not inspect or block traffic to the following destinations:

  * IPv4 API endpoints: `162.159.137.105` and `162.159.138.105`
  * IPv6 API endpoints: `2606:4700:7::a29f:8969` and `2606:4700:7::a29f:8a69`
  * SNIs for Cloudflare One Client version 2026.6.0 and later: `api.devices.cloudflare.com`
  * SNIs for versions earlier than 2026.6.0: `zero-trust-client.cloudflareclient.com` and `notifications.cloudflareclient.com`  
For more information, refer to [WARP with firewall](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/cloudflare-one-client/deployment/firewall/).
