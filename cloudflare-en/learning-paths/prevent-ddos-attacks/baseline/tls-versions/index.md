# Update TLS versions

Last updated Apr 23, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/learning-paths/prevent-ddos-attacks/baseline/tls-versions/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

In some circumstances - specifically when an application allows client-initiated SSL/TLS renegotiation - previous versions of SSL/TLS can be more vulnerable to DDoS attacks.

When you use an SSL/TLS certificate issued by Cloudflare[1](#user-content-fn-1), you can reduce the impact of this vulnerability by:

* Updating the [Minimum TLS Version](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/edge-certificates/additional-options/minimum-tls/) accepted by your application.
* Allowing [TLS 1.3](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/edge-certificates/additional-options/tls-13/).
