# Monitor and batch your website data

Last updated Apr 23, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/learning-paths/workflows-course/series/workflows-2/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Workflows can be used to process batches of data, ensuring each item in the batch goes through a defined process with reliable execution. This section demonstrates processing a batch of puns using the Punderful application as an example.

**Related content**

If you want to dive into detail, refer to the following pages:

* [Source code for the Punderful repository ↗](https://github.com/craigsdennis/punderful-workflows)
* [Cloudflare Workflows](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workflows/)
* [Cloudflare Workers AI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/)

The Punderful application processes user-submitted puns by performing content moderation, creating embeddings, categorizing, and adding them to a vector store. This process is defined as a Workflow. To process a batch of existing puns (from an open-source dataset called OPun), a batch endpoint is created that iterates through the puns and triggers the defined Workflow for each one.

#### Batch Processing Code

The following code snippet shows the endpoint responsible for batch processing:

[See here ↗](https://github.com/craigsdennis/punderful-workflows/tree/main/src/index.tsx#L291)

This code:

1. Fetches the list of puns from a JSON file (`puns.json`).
2. Logs the number of puns being processed.
3. Sets a user ID for tracking.
4. Loops through each pun.
5. Performs basic text cleaning on the pun.
6. Inserts the pun into the database (handled by `insertPun`).
7. Triggers the `PUBLISH` Workflow for each individual pun using `c.env.PUBLISH.create()`. The Workflow is given a unique ID using `crypto.randomUUID()`.

### Monitoring Workflow Instances via CLI

The Cloudflare Wrangler CLI provides commands to monitor and manage Workflows and their instances.

To list the available workflows associated with your account:

```bash
npx wrangler workflows list
```

To list the instances of a specific workflow (for example, the `publish` workflow):

```bash
npx wrangler workflows instances list publish
```

This command will show a list of workflow instances, their status (Queued, Running, Completed, Errored), and timestamps.

To view the details of a specific workflow instance, including its steps and their status, duration, and output:

```bash
npx wrangler workflows instances describe publish <instance-id>
```

Replace `<instance-id>` with the actual ID of a running or completed instance from the `list` command output.

#### Example CLI Output (Describe Instance)

Describing a workflow instance provides a detailed breakdown of its execution:

```plaintext
Workflow Name: publish
Instance ID: oPun-batch-aea07d75-95fa-448f-9573-6e435388eff7
Version ID: 75665fce-24a1-4c83-a561-088aabc91e5f
Status: Completed
Trigger: API
Queued: 10/24/2024, 1:43:45 AM
Success: Yes
Start: 10/24/2024, 1:43:45 AM
End: 10/24/2024, 1:43:49 AM
Duration: 4 seconds
Last Successful Step: update-status-to-published-1
Steps:

Name: content-moderation-1
Type: Step
Start: 10/24/2024, 1:43:45 AM
End: 10/24/2024, 1:43:45 AM
Duration: 0 seconds
Success: Yes
Output: "true"
Config: {"retries":{"limit":5,"delay":1000,"backoff":"exponential"},"timeout":"10 minutes"}
Attempts:
  Status: Completed
  Start Time: Oct 23, 2024 6:44:57 PM
  End Time: Oct 23, 2024 6:44:57 PM
  Wall Time: 180 ms
... (additional steps like create-pun-embedding-1, categorize-pun-1, add-embeddings-to-vector-store-1, update-status-to-published-1)
```

This output shows the status, start/end times, duration, success status, and even the output and configuration for each step within the workflow instance.

### Monitoring Workflow Instances via Cloudflare Dashboard

You can also monitor Workflows and their instances directly in the Cloudflare Dashboard.

This dashboard view provides a user-friendly way to observe the progress of your batch jobs, identify failed instances, and inspect the execution details of each step.

### [Watch Episode 1: Understand Cloudflare Workflows](https://developers.cloudflare.com/learning-paths/workflows-course/series/workflows-1/)

In this episode, we introduce Cloudflare Workflows, which provides durable execution capabilities, allowing developers to create reliable, repeatable workflows that run in the background.

### [Watch Episode 2: Monitor and batch your website data](https://developers.cloudflare.com/learning-paths/workflows-course/series/workflows-2/)

In this episode, we describe how Workflows can be used to process batches of data, ensuring each item in the batch goes through a defined process with reliable execution.

### [Watch Episode 3: Use cron triggers to develop time-aware applications](https://developers.cloudflare.com/learning-paths/workflows-course/series/workflows-3/)

In this episode, we review Workflows ability to explicitly schedule tasks using cron triggers and pause execution with \`step.sleep\` allows developers to build sophisticated, time-aware applications.
