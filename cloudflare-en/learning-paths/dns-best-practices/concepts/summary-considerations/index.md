# Key considerations and best practices summary

Last updated Apr 23, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/learning-paths/dns-best-practices/concepts/summary-considerations/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

* Plan meticulously: Do not rush the planning and preparation phases.
* Communicate clearly: Keep stakeholders informed.
* Lower TTLs in advance: This is crucial for a faster cutover.
* Disable DNSSEC before NS change (safest): Remove DS records at the registrar well before changing nameservers, then re-enable DNSSEC via Cloudflare.
* Verify, verify, verify: Double-check record imports and functionality at each stage.
* Test thoroughly: From multiple locations and for all critical services.
* Have a rollback plan: Know how to revert if necessary.
* Migrate during low traffic: Minimize potential user impact.
* Address BIND Views/ACLs: Understand how Cloudflare will handle or replace this functionality.
* Take advantage of Cloudflare features: Once stable, explore and implement Cloudflare's security and performance enhancements.

By following these best practices, you can significantly increase the likelihood of a smooth and successful migration from your on-prem BIND DNS to Cloudflare.
