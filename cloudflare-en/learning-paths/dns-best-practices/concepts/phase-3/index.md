# Phase 3: Execution (Migration window)

Last updated Apr 23, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/learning-paths/dns-best-practices/concepts/phase-3/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Phase 3 is when you make the actual switch to Cloudflare.

## 1\. Final verification

Complete one last check of all DNS records in your Cloudflare dashboard for accuracy and ensure your BIND servers are still operational as a fallback if needed.

## 2\. Update nameservers at your registrar

1. Log in to your domain registrar's control panel for each domain.
2. Navigate to the section for managing nameservers.
3. Replace your current on-prem BIND nameserver entries with your Cloudflare nameservers.
4. Add the Cloudflare nameservers assigned to your domain (Cloudflare will provide at least two).
5. Save the changes.

## 3\. Monitor propagation

* DNS nameserver changes can take time to propagate globally, typically anywhere from a few minutes to 48 hours (though often much faster due to lowered TTLs).
* Use the commands exemplified below, replacing `yourdomain.com` by your actual domain.

  * `dig yourdomain.com NS @8.8.8.8` (query Google's DNS)
  * `dig yourdomain.com NS @1.1.1.1` (query Cloudflare's DNS)
  * `whois yourdomain.com`
  * `dig yourdomain.com @tld.nameserver.com` (`tld.nameserver.com` is the nameserver of your domain's TLD. You can find this information by querying it as `dig com ns +short` where `.com` is the example.)  
You are looking for the Cloudflare nameservers to be reported consistently.

## 4\. Initial testing

Once propagation appears to be widespread, perform basic resolution tests for critical records (for example, your website's `A` record and any `MX` records, if you had them set up).

* `dig yourdomain.com A +short`
* `dig yourdomain.com MX +short`
