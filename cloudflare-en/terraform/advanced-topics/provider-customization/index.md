# Provider customization

Last updated Apr 21, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/terraform/advanced-topics/provider-customization/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Terraform communicates with cloud and global network provider APIs such as Cloudflare through modules known as providers. These providers are [installed automatically](https://developers.cloudflare.com/terraform/tutorial/initialize-terraform/#2-initialize-terraform-and-the-cloudflare-provider) when you run `terraform init` in a directory that has a `.tf` file containing a provider.

Typically, the only required parameters to the provider are those required to authenticate. However, you may want to customize the provider to your needs. The following section covers some [optional settings ↗](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/cloudflare/#argument-reference) that you can pass to the Cloudflare Terraform provider.

## Adjust the default Cloudflare provider settings

Note

The examples below build on the [Cloudflare Terraform tutorial](https://developers.cloudflare.com/terraform/tutorial/).

You can customize the Cloudflare Terraform provider using configuration parameters, specified either in your `.tf` configuration files or via environment variables. Using environment variables may make sense when running Terraform from a CI/CD system or when the change is temporary and does not need to be persisted in your configuration history.
