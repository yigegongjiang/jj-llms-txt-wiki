# Create a partial zone using Terraform

Last updated Apr 21, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/terraform/how-to/create-partial-zone/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

A [partial zone](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/zone-setups/partial-setup/) lets you use Cloudflare for a subdomain while keeping your existing authoritative DNS provider for the parent domain. This guide shows how to automate the setup using the [Cloudflare Terraform provider ↗](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/cloudflare/cloudflare/latest/docs).

Caution

A partial zone cannot be created in the same Cloudflare account as the parent domain's full zone.

## Prerequisites

* Terraform installed. Refer to [Get started](https://developers.cloudflare.com/terraform/installing/).
* Your Cloudflare account ID and a configured provider block. Refer to [Initialize Terraform](https://developers.cloudflare.com/terraform/tutorial/initialize-terraform/).

## Create the zone

Add the zone configuration and apply the change to create the zone:

```hcl
resource "cloudflare_zone" "subdomain_example_com" {
  account = {
    id = var.cloudflare_account_id
  }
  name = "subdomain.example.com"
}
```

Then, in a new Terraform plan and apply cycle, upgrade the zone to a Business plan or higher:

```hcl
resource "cloudflare_zone_subscription" "example_zone_subscription" {
  zone_id = cloudflare_zone.subdomain_example_com.id
  frequency = "monthly"
  rate_plan = {
    id = "business"
    currency = "USD"
  }
}
```

Then, again in a new Terraform plan and apply cycle, update your Terraform configuration to add `type = "partial"` to the zone:

```hcl
resource "cloudflare_zone" "subdomain_example_com" {
  account = {
    id = var.cloudflare_account_id
  }
  name = "subdomain.example.com"
  type = "partial"
}
```

Terraform places the zone in a **Pending** state. You must add the necessary DNS records and verify domain ownership before Cloudflare activates it.

Note

Refer to the [cloudflare\_zone docs ↗](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/cloudflare/cloudflare/latest/docs/resources/zone) in the Terraform provider documentation when you need to reference other zone properties.
