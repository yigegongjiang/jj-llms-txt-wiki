# 3 – Configure HTTPS settings

Last updated May 5, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/terraform/tutorial/configure-https-settings/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

After setting up basic DNS records, you can configure zone settings using Terraform. This tutorial shows how to enable [TLS 1.3](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/edge-certificates/additional-options/tls-13/), [Automatic HTTPS Rewrites](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/edge-certificates/additional-options/automatic-https-rewrites/), and [Strict SSL mode](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/origin-configuration/ssl-modes/full-strict/) using the updated v5 provider.

## Prerequisites

* Completed tutorials [1](https://developers.cloudflare.com/terraform/tutorial/initialize-terraform/) and [2](https://developers.cloudflare.com/terraform/tutorial/track-history/)
* Valid SSL certificate on your origin server (use the [Cloudflare Origin CA](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/origin-configuration/origin-ca/) to generate one for strict SSL mode)

Note

Terraform code snippets below refer to the v5 SDK only.

## 1\. Create zone setting configuration

Create a new branch and add zone settings:

```bash
git checkout -b step3-zone-settings
```

Add the following to your `main.tf` file:

```hcl
# Enable TLS 1.3
resource "cloudflare_zone_setting" "tls_1_3" {
  zone_id    = var.zone_id
  setting_id = "tls_1_3"
  value      = "on"
}

# Enable automatic HTTPS rewrites
resource "cloudflare_zone_setting" "automatic_https_rewrites" {
  zone_id    = var.zone_id
  setting_id = "automatic_https_rewrites"
  value      = "on"
}

# Set SSL mode to strict
resource "cloudflare_zone_setting" "ssl" {
  zone_id    = var.zone_id
  setting_id = "ssl"
  value      = "strict"
}
```

## 2\. Preview and apply the changes

Review the proposed changes:

```sh
terraform plan
```

Expected output

```sh
Plan: 3 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # cloudflare_zone_setting.automatic_https_rewrites will be created
  + resource "cloudflare_zone_setting" "automatic_https_rewrites" {
      + setting_id = "automatic_https_rewrites"
      + value      = "on"
      + zone_id    = "your-zone-id"
    }

  # cloudflare_zone_setting.ssl will be created
  + resource "cloudflare_zone_setting" "ssl" {
      + setting_id = "ssl"
      + value      = "strict"
      + zone_id    = "your-zone-id"
    }

  # cloudflare_zone_setting.tls_1_3 will be created
  + resource "cloudflare_zone_setting" "tls_1_3" {
      + setting_id = "tls_1_3"
      + value      = "on"
      + zone_id    = "your-zone-id"
    }
```

Commit and merge the changes:

```bash
git add main.tf
git commit -m "Step 3 - Enable TLS 1.3, automatic HTTPS rewrites, and strict SSL"
git checkout main
git merge step3-zone-settings
git push
```

Before applying the changes, try to connect with TLS 1.3\. Technically, you should not be able to with default settings. To follow along with this test, you will need to [compile curl against BoringSSL ↗](https://everything.curl.dev/source/build/tls/boringssl#build-boringssl).

```sh
curl -v --tlsv1.3 https://www.example.com 2>&1 | grep "SSL connection\|error"
```

As shown above, you should receive an error because TLS 1.3 is not yet enabled on your zone. Enable it by running `terraform apply` and try again.

Apply the configuration:

```sh
terraform apply
```

Type `yes` when prompted.

## 3\. Verify the settings

Try the same command as before. The command will now succeed.

```sh
curl -v --tlsv1.3 https://www.example.com 2>&1 | grep "SSL connection\|error"
```
