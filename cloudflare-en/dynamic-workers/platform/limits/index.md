# Limits

Last updated Aug 27, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dynamic-workers/platform/limits/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Cloudflare limits the number of distinct Dynamic Workers with in-flight requests. Multiple in-flight requests to the same Dynamic Worker count as one toward this limit.

| Context                                                              | Concurrent Dynamic Workers |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Worker request                                                       | 4                          |
| [Durable Object](https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/) | 10 (previously 4)          |

In a Worker, each request has its own input/output (I/O) context. Each request can therefore have up to four distinct Dynamic Workers with in-flight requests.

A Durable Object shares one I/O context across all concurrent requests to the same object. Those requests can collectively have up to ten distinct Dynamic Workers with in-flight requests. To set lower CPU time or subrequest limits, refer to [Custom resource limits](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dynamic-workers/usage/limits/).
