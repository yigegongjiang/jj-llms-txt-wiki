# Dynamic Workflows Playground

Last updated May 5, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dynamic-workers/examples/dynamic-workflows-playground/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Try the [dynamic workflows playground ↗](https://github.com/cloudflare/dynamic-workflows/tree/main/examples/basic), write workflow logic in JavaScript, execute it from a Dynamic Worker, and log every step in real time.

This example shows you how to run [Cloudflare Workflows](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workflows/) from a [Dynamic Worker](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dynamic-workers/) to get full durable execution, including step retries, sleep, hibernation, and `waitForEvent`, for any workflow you need to run on demand.

## How it works

There are two parts:

* **Worker Loader** — The Worker that runs your platform logic. It receives a request, loads the user's workflow code as a Dynamic Worker, and gives it a Workflow binding so it can create and run workflows.
* **Dynamic Worker** — This is where the workflow is defined. You write the workflow logic here, including which steps need to run, how long it sleeps, and what events it waits for.

The [@cloudflare/dynamic-workflows ↗](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cloudflare/dynamic-workflows) library connects the two. When the Dynamic Worker creates a workflow, the library tags it with information about which Dynamic Worker created it. That tag is persisted by the Workflows engine, so when a workflow needs to resume after a sleep, a failure, or a server restart, the engine knows which Dynamic Worker to reload to continue execution.

For a full walkthrough of the library and how to set it up, refer to the [Dynamic Workflows guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dynamic-workers/usage/dynamic-workflows/).

## What this playground includes

* **Worker Loader and Dynamic Worker setup** — A full working example of a Worker Loader that loads workflow code at runtime and a Dynamic Worker that runs it with durable execution, using [@cloudflare/dynamic-workflows ↗](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cloudflare/dynamic-workflows).
* **Live log streaming** — Every `console.log()` and `console.warn()` from the Dynamic Worker is captured and streamed to the browser in real time, so you can see what is happening inside each step as it runs.
* **Source persistence** — The workflow code is saved so that if the workflow pauses (for example, during a `step.sleep()`) and the server recycles the process, it can reload the same code and resume where it left off.
