# Dynamic Workers Starter

Last updated May 5, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dynamic-workers/examples/dynamic-workers-starter/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

A [starter template ↗](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/tree/main/examples/dynamic-workers) for deploying a Worker that loads and runs [Dynamic Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dynamic-workers/).

## What it does

This template demonstrates how to use the [Worker Loader API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/worker-loader/) to execute code at runtime. The host Worker exposes an `/api/run` endpoint that accepts code from the frontend, loads it into a sandboxed Dynamic Worker, and returns the result.

Use this pattern for AI agents that need to execute a snippet of code to complete an action.

## Configuration

Add a `worker_loaders` binding to your Wrangler file:

```jsonc
{
	"worker_loaders": [
		{
			"binding": "LOADER"
		}
	]
}
```

```toml
[[worker_loaders]]
binding = "LOADER"
```

## Loading and executing a Dynamic Worker

In this example:

* `env.LOADER.load()` creates a one-off dynamic isolate
* `globalOutbound: null` blocks all outbound network access from the Dynamic Worker

```js
export default {
	async fetch(request, env) {
		const { code } = await request.json();

		const worker = env.LOADER.load({
			compatibilityDate: "2026-05-01",
			mainModule: "worker.js",
			modules: {
				"worker.js": code,
			},
			// Block all outbound network access
			globalOutbound: null,
		});

		const result = await worker.getEntrypoint().fetch(request);
		return result;
	},
};
```

```ts
export default {
	async fetch(request, env): Promise<Response> {
		const { code } = await request.json();

		const worker = env.LOADER.load({
			compatibilityDate: "2026-05-01",
			mainModule: "worker.js",
			modules: {
				"worker.js": code,
			},
			// Block all outbound network access
			globalOutbound: null,
		});

		const result = await worker.getEntrypoint().fetch(request);
		return result;
	},
} satisfies ExportedHandler;
```

## Running locally

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```
