# AI Crawl Control with Transform Rules

Last updated Apr 23, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-crawl-control/configuration/ai-crawl-control-with-transform-rules/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Use [Response Header Transform Rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/transform/response-header-modification/) to add `Link` headers to crawler responses — even when those crawlers are blocked. This lets you communicate terms of use or [RSL ↗](https://rslstandard.org/) license information.

## Example: Add licensing terms to blocked responses

**Expression:**

```txt
(cf.bot_management.verified_bot and http.response.code eq 403)
```

**Header modification:**

* **Operation:** Set static
* **Header name:** `Link`
* **Value:** `<https://example.com/ai-licensing-terms>; rel="license"; type="text/html"`

For more details, refer to [Response Header Transform Rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/transform/response-header-modification/).
