# AI Crawl Control with Cloudflare Bots

Last updated Jul 1, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-crawl-control/configuration/ai-crawl-control-with-bots/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

AI Crawl Control works alongside other Cloudflare products, such as Cloudflare [bot solutions](https://developers.cloudflare.com/bots/). Bot solutions identifies traffic matching patterns of known bots, and can challenge or block the bots as you wish.

## Order of precedence

* AI Crawl Control's AI crawler blocking uses [WAF custom rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/custom-rules/), which take place before Cloudflare bot solutions.
* AI Crawl Control's pay per crawl takes place after Cloudflare bot solutions.

For more information on how Cloudflare classifies bot traffic, refer to [AI bots](https://developers.cloudflare.com/bots/concepts/bot/#ai-bots).

## Examples

Consider the following examples.

### Bot rule which blocks all AI bots vs pay per crawl

You may have both of the following enabled:

* A selection of AI crawlers to be charged through AI Crawl Control's pay per crawl
* Bot configuration option to [Block AI Bots](https://developers.cloudflare.com/bots/get-started/bot-fight-mode/#block-ai-bots).

Since pay per crawl happens after bot solutions, you need to first turn off **Block AI Bots** to ensure pay per crawl works as intended.
