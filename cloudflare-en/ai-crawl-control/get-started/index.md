# Get started

Last updated Apr 23, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-crawl-control/get-started/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

This guide instructs you on how to:

* View AI crawlers that are interacting with pages in your domain (a [Cloudflare zone](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/concepts/accounts-and-zones/#zones)).
* Use AI Crawl Control to block individual crawlers from accessing your content.

## Prerequisites

1. Sign up for a [Cloudflare account ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up/).
2. [Connect your domain to Cloudflare](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/manage-domains/add-site/).
3. Make sure your domain is [proxying traffic through Cloudflare](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/concepts/how-cloudflare-works/#cloudflare-as-a-reverse-proxy).

## 1\. Monitor AI crawler activity at a glance

1. Go to **AI Crawl Control**.  
[Go to **AI Crawl Control** ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/:zone/ai)
2. Review the snapshot of your AI crawler activity in the **Overview** tab.
3. Use the filters to view activity by specific date ranges, crawlers, operators, hostnames, or paths.

## 2\. Block specific AI crawlers

To block specific AI crawlers:

1. Go to **AI Crawl Control**.  
[Go to **AI Crawl Control** ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/:zone/ai)
2. Review which AI crawlers are accessing your domain in the **Crawlers** tab.
3. In the **Action** column, select **Block**.

Quality of AI crawler detection

On the free plan, AI Crawl Control identifies AI crawlers based on their [user agent strings ↗](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/User-Agent). This enables AI Crawl Control to detect well-known, self-identifying AI crawlers.

Upgrade your plan to enable a more thorough detection using Cloudflare's [Bot Management detection ID](https://developers.cloudflare.com/bots/reference/bot-management-variables/#ruleset-engine-fields) field.

To block specific AI crawlers:

1. Go to **AI Crawl Control**.  
[Go to **AI Crawl Control** ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/:zone/ai)
2. Review which AI crawlers are accessing your domain in the **Crawlers** tab.
3. In the **Action** column, select **Block**.

For more information, refer to [Manage AI crawlers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-crawl-control/features/manage-ai-crawlers/).

You can also create more complex rules when taking action on AI crawlers, using [Cloudflare WAF](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/). For more information on creating more specific rules, refer to [Create a custom rule in the dashboard](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/custom-rules/create-dashboard/).

## 3\. Explore detailed metrics

For more detailed analytics, use the **Metrics** tab.

1. Go to **AI Crawl Control**.  
[Go to **AI Crawl Control** ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/:zone/ai)
2. Review detailed breakdowns by date range, crawler, operator, status code, hostname, or path in the **Metrics** tab.

Note that on free plans, the **Metrics** tab only displays metrics for the past 24 hours.

## Next steps

* [Manage AI crawlers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-crawl-control/features/manage-ai-crawlers/) with granular allow/block controls.
* [Analyze AI traffic](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-crawl-control/features/analyze-ai-traffic/) to understand crawler patterns and content popularity.
* [Explore pay per crawl](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-crawl-control/features/pay-per-crawl/what-is-pay-per-crawl/) to test content monetization options (private beta).
