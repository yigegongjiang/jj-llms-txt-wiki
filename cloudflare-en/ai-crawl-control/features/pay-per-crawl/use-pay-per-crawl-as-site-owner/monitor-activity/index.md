After configuring pay per crawl, monitor crawler activity to understand how AI crawlers interact with your content, and track your earnings.

## View crawler activity

1. Go to **AI Crawl Control**.  
[Go to **AI Crawl Control** ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/:zone/ai)
2. Go to the **Metrics** tab to view detailed analytics.

The metrics help you understand:

* Which crawlers are accessing your content
* How often they are being charged
* Request patterns and trends
* Robots.txt violations

For detailed information about available metrics, refer to [View AI Crawl Control metrics](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-crawl-control/features/analyze-ai-traffic/#view-the-metrics-tab).

Balance visibility

Your accrued earnings balance is not currently visible in the dashboard. You can request balance updates from your Cloudflare team.

## Additional considerations

### Robots.txt management

Consider updating your `robots.txt` file to clearly indicate which pages should remain off-limits, even if AI crawlers are willing to pay for access.

### Ongoing optimization

Do the following to ensure you are using pay per crawl most effectively:

* Review crawler activity regularly to identify patterns
* Adjust pricing based on demand and content value
* Modify crawler actions (charge, allow, block) as needed
* Monitor for any unusual or unwanted crawler behavior
