# Advanced configuration

Last updated Jul 28, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-crawl-control/features/pay-per-crawl/use-pay-per-crawl-as-site-owner/advanced-configuration/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

## Disable Pay Per Crawl by URI pattern

You may want to offer free access to certain pages while charging for others:

* Allow free access to **homepages, category pages, or navigation** to help crawlers discover paid content.
* Exclude functional pages like **login, search, or API endpoints** that don't contain chargeable content.
* Start with Pay Per Crawl on **a small section of your site** before expanding.
* Offer free access to **promotional or archived content** while charging for premium articles.

To get started, use [Configuration Rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/configuration-rules/) to exclude specific URI patterns from charging.

1. Go to **Rules** \> **Overview** in the Cloudflare dashboard.  
[Go to **Overview** ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/:zone/rules/overview)
2. Select **Create rule** \> **Configuration Rule**.
3. **When incoming requests match**: Set your URI pattern.

  * Field: `URI Full`
  * Operator: `wildcard`
  * Value: `https://*example.com/public/*`
4. Select **Disable Pay Per Crawl** \> **Add**
5. Select **Deploy**.

**Example patterns:**

* Free homepage: `URI Full` equals `https://example.com/`
* Free directory: `URI Full` wildcard `https://*example.com/public/*`

Note

Some paths are always free to crawl. These paths are: `/robots.txt`, `/sitemap.xml`, `/security.txt`, `/.well-known/security.txt`, `/crawlers.json`

## Dynamic pricing

The price you specify in Pay Per Crawl settings applies to the entire zone by default, but you can implement a differentiated pricing policy by selecting **Enable dynamic pricing** and having your origin HTTP responses include a `crawler-price` header. For example:

```http
crawler-price: USD 3.14
```

When the `crawler-price` header is present in a response, the price it specifies will be used instead of the default price specified in the Pay Per Crawl settings for the zone.

Note

When Pay Per Crawl is enabled for a zone, the `crawler-price` response header is only forwarded to the client when the client is being asked to pay for the content (HTTP 402).

### Request header for dynamic pricing

Pay Per Crawl adds a `cf-pay-per-crawl` header to every origin request. This header indicates the pricing mode in effect, and can be used by the origin to decide whether or not to include a `crawler-price` header with the response.

```http
cf-pay-per-crawl: protocol=cloudflare, pricing=in-band
```

Currently, the only possible value for the `protocol` indicator is `cloudflare`. For the `pricing` indicator the value can be one of the following:

* **`zone-default`**: When the zone does not have in-band pricing enabled.
* **`in-band`**: When the zone has dynamic pricing enabled.
* **`bypass`**: When the request is not subject to payment (for example, not a bot).

### Use Workers for dynamic pricing

If you prefer to maintain your origin as is, you can use a Worker to include the `crawler-price` header in responses. From a Worker you can, for example, select the price based on the incoming request's properties (including information added by the Cloudflare global network) or the content itself.

Snippets limitations

The `cf-pay-per-crawl` request header is also visible to Snippets, allowing for simple transformations without the full power of Workers. However, Snippets cannot be used to select a `crawler-price`, as response transformations at that later stage of request processing are no longer actionable by Pay Per Crawl.

The following Worker script implements a simple example policy that selects the price based on the requested URL path, while still taking advantage of Cloudflare Cache:

```typescript
function getContentPriceUSD(request, response) {
	const requestPath = new URL(request.url).pathname;

	if (requestPath.startsWith("/premium-content/")) {
		return 3.14;
	}

	if (requestPath.startsWith("/free-content/")) {
		return 0.0;
	}

	return null; // Use the default price set in the zone configuration.
}

export default {
	async fetch(request, env, ctx) {
		// Obtain the response first (and allow it to be cached if possible).
		let response = await fetch(request, { cf: { cacheEverything: true } });

		// Indicates the pricing mode in effect ("bypass", "zone-default", "in-band").
		const cfPayPerCrawl = request.headers.get("CF-Pay-Per-Crawl") || "";

		// If in-band pricing is enabled, use the request/response to select a price.
		if (cfPayPerCrawl.match(/\bpricing=in-band\b/)) {
			const contentPrice = getContentPriceUSD(request, response);

			if (contentPrice !== null) {
				// Make the response mutable, to allow setting the price header.
				response = new Response(response.body, response);
				response.headers.set("Crawler-Price", `USD ${contentPrice.toFixed(2)}`);
			}
		}
		return response;
	}
};
```
