Last updated Apr 23, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-crawl-control/features/pay-per-crawl/use-pay-per-crawl-as-site-owner/advanced-configuration/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

## Disable Pay Per Crawl by URI pattern

You may want to offer free access to certain pages while charging for others:

* Allow free access to **homepages, category pages, or navigation** to help crawlers discover paid content.
* Exclude functional pages like **login, search, or API endpoints** that don't contain chargeable content.
* Start with Pay Per Crawl on **a small section of your site** before expanding.
* Offer free access to **promotional or archived content** while charging for premium articles.

To get started, use [Configuration Rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/configuration-rules/) to exclude specific URI patterns from charging.

1. Go to **Rules** \> **Overview** in the Cloudflare dashboard.  
[Go to **Overview** ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/:zone/rules/overview)
2. Select **Create rule** \> **Configuration Rule**.
3. **When incoming requests match**: Set your URI pattern.

  * Field: `URI Full`
  * Operator: `wildcard`
  * Value: `https://*example.com/public/*`
4. Select **Disable Pay Per Crawl** \> **Add**
5. Select **Deploy**.

**Example patterns:**

* Free homepage: `URI Full` equals `https://example.com/`
* Free directory: `URI Full` wildcard `https://*example.com/public/*`

Note

Some paths are always free to crawl. These paths are: `/robots.txt`, `/sitemap.xml`, `/security.txt`, `/.well-known/security.txt`, `/crawlers.json`
