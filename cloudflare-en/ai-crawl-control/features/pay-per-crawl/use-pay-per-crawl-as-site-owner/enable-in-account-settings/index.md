## Prerequisites

To configure pay per crawl, you must have the following:

* **Cloudflare account**: You need an active Cloudflare account with domains added
* **Domain on Cloudflare**: Your domain must be using Cloudflare's nameservers, or have DNS records managed by Cloudflare
* **Administrator access**: You need Administrator or Super Administrator permissions for account-level configuration

## Configure domain access

An Administrator or Super Administrator with access to all domains must select which domains should show the pay per crawl controls:

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to **Manage Account** \> **Settings**.  
[Go to **Configurations** ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/configurations)
2. Select **Pay Per Crawl**.
3. In the **Domain Access** table, select which domains will have pay per crawl configurations visible.
4. Set the **Visibility** to **Visible** for each domain you want to configure.

Visibility vs Security

Setting a domain to **Visible** will not affect security rules. This only makes the pay per crawl configuration controls accessible to domain-level administrators.

After completing these steps, domain administrators can set a pay per crawl price and enable pay per crawl for their specific domains.
