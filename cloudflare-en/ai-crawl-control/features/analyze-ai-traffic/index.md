AI Crawl Control metrics provide you with insight on how AI crawlers are interacting with your website ([Cloudflare zone](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/concepts/accounts-and-zones/#zones)).

To view AI Crawl Control metrics:

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/), and select your account and domain.
2. Go to **AI Crawl Control**.  
[Go to **AI Crawl Control** ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/:zone/ai)

You can find meaningful information across the **Overview**, **Crawlers**, and **Metrics** tabs.

## View the Overview tab

The **Overview** tab provides a snapshot of AI crawler activity:

| Component                         | What you can do                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

## View the Metrics tab

The **Metrics** tab provides detailed analytics and charts to help you understand how AI crawlers are interacting with your website.

### Requests over time

Visualize crawler activity patterns over the selected time period. Use the view selector to switch between metrics:

| View                 | Description                                                                       |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **All requests**     | Total requests including blocked and error responses.                             |
| **Allowed requests** | Requests that received a successful response (status 200-299).                    |
| **Data transfer**    | Bandwidth consumption for allowed requests over time, formatted as KB, MB, or GB. |

You can group the data by different dimensions:

| Dimension    | Description                                                                             |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Crawler**  | Track activity from individual AI crawlers (such as GPTBot, ClaudeBot, Bytespider).     |
| **Category** | Analyze crawlers by their purpose or type.                                              |
| **Operator** | Discover which companies (such as OpenAI, Anthropic, ByteDance) are crawling your site. |
| **Host**     | Break down activity across multiple subdomains.                                         |

Note

The Data transfer view shows `edgeResponseBytes`. Some crawlers may show higher data transfer per request than others, depending on the content they request.

### Status code distribution

The **Status code distribution** chart shows HTTP response codes for AI crawler requests over time:

* **2xx** — Successful responses
* **3xx** — Redirects
* **4xx** — Client errors (including 403 blocked and 402 payment required)
* **5xx** — Server errors

Use this chart to identify patterns in how your site responds to AI crawlers, including the distribution of error codes and the volume of redirects.

### Content Format

The **Content Format** chart shows what content types AI systems request versus what your origin serves. This visibility helps you understand content negotiation patterns and optimize how your content is delivered to AI systems.

The chart includes three views:

| View              | Description                                                                       |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Comparison**    | A grouped bar chart comparing requested content types versus served content types |
| **Request Type**  | Breakdown of requests by Accept header                                            |
| **Response Type** | Breakdown of responses by Content-Type header                                     |

### Top referrers

Note

This feature is available for customers on a paid plan.

Identify traffic sources with referrer analytics to understand discovery patterns and content popularity from AI operators.

| View                     | Description                                                                                                        |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Referral sources**     | Top domains sending AI-driven referral traffic to your site (for example, chatgpt.com, perplexity.ai).             |
| **Destination patterns** | Which site areas receive the most AI-driven referral traffic, grouped by pattern (for example, /blog/\*, /api/\*). |

Toggle between views using the tabs in the Top referrers section.

### Referrals over time

Track referral traffic trends over your selected time period. Group by:

| Dimension    | Description                                                                |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Operator** | Stacked area chart showing referrals by company (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.). |
| **Source**   | Top referral URLs driving traffic.                                         |
| **Total**    | Aggregate referral volume.                                                 |

### Most popular paths

The **Most popular paths** table shows which pages on your site are most frequently requested by AI crawlers.

| Column               | Description                                               |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Path**             | The page path that was requested.                         |
| **Hostname**         | The hostname of the requested page.                       |
| **Referrals**        | Number of referral visits to this path from AI platforms. |
| **Allowed requests** | Number of successful requests to this path.               |

To see a breakdown by crawler per path, use the top-level filters.

#### Analyze site areas with pattern grouping

Select the **Patterns** tab to see requests grouped by URI pattern (such as `/blog/*`, `/api/v1/*`, or `/docs/*`). This helps you quickly identify which areas of your site AI crawlers target most.

Pattern grouping aggregates individual paths into site areas:

* Patterns include up to 2 levels of depth (for example, `/api/*`, `/api/v1/*`)
* The root pattern `/*` shows total traffic across your site
* Patterns are not aggregated across hostnames
* Single-path patterns display without wildcards (for example, `sitemap.xml` instead of `sitemap.xml/*`)

Additional tabs include:

* **All** — Combined content and media requests (individual paths, not patterns)
* **Content** — HTML, JSON, and text content
* **Media** — Images, videos, and other media files

## Filter and export data

Use the filter bar to narrow your analysis by multiple criteria:

| Filter         | Description                               |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Date range** | Select the time period to analyze.        |
| **Crawler**    | Filter to specific AI crawlers.           |
| **Operator**   | Filter to specific companies.             |
| **Hostname**   | Filter to specific subdomains.            |
| **Path**       | Filter to specific URL paths or patterns. |

Combine multiple filters for complex analysis. All metrics and charts update dynamically based on your filter selection.

To export your data, select **Download CSV** or **Download image**. Downloads include all applied filters and groupings.

## Per-crawler drilldowns

The **Crawlers** tab includes an actions menu for each crawler with the following options:

| Action                         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
