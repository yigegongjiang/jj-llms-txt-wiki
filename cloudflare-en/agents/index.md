# Build Agents on Cloudflare

Last updated Jun 24, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agents/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Build and host Agents on Cloudflare, connect chat, voice, email, Slack, and webhooks to a durable agent runtime with Browser, Sandbox, AI Search, MCP, Payments, and other MCP tools.

When you host agents on Cloudflare, each agent session has a durable identity, local SQL storage, real-time connections, scheduled work, and recoverable execution.

Deploy once and Cloudflare runs your agents across its global network, scaling to tens of millions of instances. No infrastructure to manage, no sessions to reconstruct, no state to externalize.

Agents on Cloudflare are composed from four parts:

* **Communication channels** define how users and systems reach your agent, such as [chat](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agents/communication-channels/chat/), [voice](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agents/communication-channels/voice/), [email](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agents/communication-channels/email/), [Slack](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agents/communication-channels/slack/), [webhooks](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agents/communication-channels/webhooks/), and other event sources.
* **The agent harness** defines the loop: how the agent calls models, selects tools, handles tool results, streams responses, and decides whether to continue. Use [Project Think](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agents/harnesses/think/) for an opinionated harness, or build your own loop directly on the [Agents SDK runtime](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agents/runtime/agents-api/).
* **The Agents SDK runtime** provides durable infrastructure: the [Agent class](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agents/runtime/lifecycle/agent-class/), [state](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agents/runtime/lifecycle/state/), [sessions](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agents/runtime/lifecycle/sessions/), [routing](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agents/runtime/communication/routing/), [WebSockets](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agents/runtime/communication/websockets/), [scheduling](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agents/runtime/execution/schedule-tasks/), [fibers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agents/runtime/execution/durable-execution/), and [observability](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agents/runtime/operations/observability/).
* **Tools** give the agent capabilities: [browser automation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agents/tools/browser/), [sandboxed code execution](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agents/tools/sandbox/), [AI Search](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agents/tools/ai-search/), [MCP tools](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agents/tools/mcp/), and [payments](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agents/tools/payments/). [Code Mode](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agents/tools/codemode/) lets models discover and orchestrate multiple tools by writing code.

### Get started

Three commands to a running agent. No API keys required — the starter uses [Workers AI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/) by default.

```sh
npx create-cloudflare@latest --template cloudflare/agents-starter
cd agents-starter && npm install
npm run dev
```

The starter includes streaming AI chat, server-side and client-side tools, human-in-the-loop approval, and task scheduling — a foundation you can build on or tear apart. You can also swap in [OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, or any other provider](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agents/runtime/operations/using-ai-models/).

### Example agents

[Chat agent](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agents/examples/chat-agent/)

Build a streaming AI chat agent with tools and human-in-the-loop approvals.

[Slack agent](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agents/examples/slack-agent/)

Build an agent that responds to Slack messages, mentions, and commands.

[Voice agent](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agents/examples/voice-agent/)

Build a real-time voice agent with speech-to-text and text-to-speech.

[Browser agent](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agents/examples/browser-agent/)

Build an agent that can inspect pages, capture screenshots, and use browser tools.

[Email agent](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agents/examples/email-agent/)

Build an agent that sends, receives, routes, and replies to email.
