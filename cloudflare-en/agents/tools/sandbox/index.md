# Sandbox

Last updated Jun 3, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agents/tools/sandbox/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Agents can use [Sandbox](https://developers.cloudflare.com/sandbox/) to run code in isolated container environments. Use Sandbox when an agent needs a real filesystem, shell commands, language runtimes, package installation, or long-lived project state that should not run inside the agent's own Worker isolate.

Sandbox is built on [Cloudflare Containers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/containers/) and exposes a TypeScript API for command execution, file operations, background processes, and service previews.

## When to use Sandbox

Use Sandbox for agents that need to:

* Run untrusted or model-generated code in isolation.
* Execute Python, Node.js, shell commands, or package managers.
* Read, write, and manage project files.
* Run tests, linters, build tools, or data analysis scripts.
* Maintain a workspace across multiple agent turns.

## Basic pattern

Bind the Sandbox Durable Object to your Worker, then access a sandbox from your agent methods with `getSandbox()`.

```js
import { Agent, callable } from "agents";
import { getSandbox } from "@cloudflare/sandbox";

export { Sandbox } from "@cloudflare/sandbox";

export class CodeAgent extends Agent {
	@callable()
	async runPython(code) {
		const sandbox = getSandbox(this.env.Sandbox, this.name);

		await sandbox.writeFile("/workspace/script.py", code);
		const result = await sandbox.exec("python3 /workspace/script.py");

		this.setState({ lastOutput: result.stdout });

		return {
			success: result.success,
			stdout: result.stdout,
			stderr: result.stderr,
			exitCode: result.exitCode,
		};
	}
}
```

```ts
import { Agent, callable } from "agents";
import { getSandbox } from "@cloudflare/sandbox";
import type { Sandbox } from "@cloudflare/sandbox";

export { Sandbox } from "@cloudflare/sandbox";

type Env = {
	Sandbox: DurableObjectNamespace<Sandbox>;
};

export class CodeAgent extends Agent<Env, { lastOutput?: string }> {
	@callable()
	async runPython(code: string) {
		const sandbox = getSandbox(this.env.Sandbox, this.name);

		await sandbox.writeFile("/workspace/script.py", code);
		const result = await sandbox.exec("python3 /workspace/script.py");

		this.setState({ lastOutput: result.stdout });

		return {
			success: result.success,
			stdout: result.stdout,
			stderr: result.stderr,
			exitCode: result.exitCode,
		};
	}
}
```

## Configuration

Configure the Sandbox container, Durable Object binding, and migration in `wrangler.jsonc`.

```jsonc
{
	"containers": [
		{
			"class_name": "Sandbox",
			"image": "./Dockerfile",
			"instance_type": "lite",
			"max_instances": 1
		}
	],
	"durable_objects": {
		"bindings": [
			{
				"name": "Sandbox",
				"class_name": "Sandbox"
			}
		]
	},
	"migrations": [
		{
			"tag": "v1",
			"new_sqlite_classes": ["Sandbox"]
		}
	]
}
```

```toml
[[containers]]
class_name = "Sandbox"
image = "./Dockerfile"
instance_type = "lite"
max_instances = 1

[[durable_objects.bindings]]
name = "Sandbox"
class_name = "Sandbox"

[[migrations]]
tag = "v1"
new_sqlite_classes = [ "Sandbox" ]
```

## Sandbox and agent state

Use agent state for user-visible progress and small metadata. Use the sandbox filesystem for workspace files, generated code, package installs, logs, and artifacts.

For long-running sandbox work, pair Sandbox with [durable execution with fibers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agents/runtime/execution/durable-execution/) or [Workflows](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agents/runtime/execution/run-workflows/) so the agent can recover or report progress if work outlives a single request.
