# Pay from Agents SDK

Last updated Jun 3, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agents/tools/payments/x402/pay-from-agents-sdk/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

The Agents SDK includes an MCP client that can pay for x402-protected tools. Use it from your Agents or any MCP client connection.

```ts
import { Agent } from "agents";
import { withX402Client } from "agents/x402";
import { privateKeyToAccount } from "viem/accounts";

export class MyAgent extends Agent {
	// Your Agent definitions...

	async onStart() {
		const { id } = await this.mcp.connect(`${this.env.WORKER_URL}/mcp`);
		const account = privateKeyToAccount(this.env.MY_PRIVATE_KEY);

		this.x402Client = withX402Client(this.mcp.mcpConnections[id].client, {
			network: "base-sepolia",
			account,
		});
	}

	onPaymentRequired(paymentRequirements): Promise<boolean> {
		// Your human-in-the-loop confirmation flow...
	}

	async onToolCall(toolName: string, toolArgs: unknown) {
		// The first parameter is the confirmation callback.
		// Set to `null` for the agent to pay automatically.
		return await this.x402Client.callTool(this.onPaymentRequired, {
			name: toolName,
			arguments: toolArgs,
		});
	}
}
```

For a complete working example, see [x402-mcp on GitHub ↗](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/tree/main/examples/x402-mcp).

## Environment setup

Store your private key securely:

```sh
# Local development (.dev.vars)
MY_PRIVATE_KEY="0x..."

# Production
npx wrangler secret put MY_PRIVATE_KEY
```

Use `base-sepolia` for testing. Get test USDC from the [Circle faucet ↗](https://faucet.circle.com/).
