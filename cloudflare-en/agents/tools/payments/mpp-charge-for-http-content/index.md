# Charge for HTTP content

Last updated Aug 5, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agents/tools/payments/mpp-charge-for-http-content/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

The [mpp-proxy ↗](https://github.com/cloudflare/mpp-proxy) template is a Cloudflare Worker that sits in front of any HTTP backend. When a request hits a protected route, the proxy returns a `402` response with an MPP payment challenge. After the client pays, the proxy verifies the payment, forwards the request to your origin, and issues a 1-hour session cookie.

Deploy the mpp-proxy template to your Cloudflare account:

[![Deploy to Cloudflare](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/cloudflare/mpp-proxy)

## Prerequisites

* A [Cloudflare account ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up)
* An HTTP backend to gate
* A wallet address to receive payments

## Configuration

Define protected routes in `wrangler.jsonc`:

```jsonc
{
	"vars": {
		"PAY_TO": "0xYourWalletAddress",
		"TEMPO_TESTNET": false,
		"PAYMENT_CURRENCY": "0x20c000000000000000000000b9537d11c60e8b50",
		"PROTECTED_PATTERNS": [
			{
				"pattern": "/premium/*",
				"amount": "0.01",
				"description": "Access to premium content for 1 hour"
			}
		]
	}
}
```

Note

Set `TEMPO_TESTNET` to `true` and `PAYMENT_CURRENCY` to `0x20c0000000000000000000000000000000000000` for testnet development.

## Selective gating with Bot Management

With [Bot Management](https://developers.cloudflare.com/bots/), the proxy can charge crawlers while keeping the site free for humans:

```jsonc
{
	"pattern": "/content/*",
	"amount": "0.25",
	"description": "Content access for 1 hour",
	"bot_score_threshold": 30,
	"except_detection_ids": [120623194, 117479730]
}
```

Requests with a bot score at or below `bot_score_threshold` are directed to the paywall. Use `except_detection_ids` to allowlist specific crawlers by [detection ID](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-crawl-control/reference/bots/).

## Deploy

Clone the template, edit `wrangler.jsonc`, and deploy:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/cloudflare/mpp-proxy
cd mpp-proxy
npm install
npx wrangler secret put JWT_SECRET
npx wrangler secret put MPP_SECRET_KEY
npx wrangler deploy
```

For full configuration options, proxy modes, and Bot Management examples, refer to the [mpp-proxy README ↗](https://github.com/cloudflare/mpp-proxy).

## Custom Worker endpoints

To add MPP middleware directly to a Worker, refer to [Accept payments with MPP](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agents/tools/payments/mpp/accept-payments/#charge-for-a-worker-route).
