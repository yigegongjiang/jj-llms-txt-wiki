# Actions

Last updated Jun 26, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agents/harnesses/think/actions/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Experimental

The Actions API surface may evolve before Think graduates out of experimental.

Actions are server-side tools with batteries included. Where a plain AI SDK `tool()` is just a description, a schema, and an `execute` function, an `action()` adds the things that are tedious and dangerous to get right by hand for a tool that has real side effects:

* **Idempotency** — a durable ledger replays a settled result by a stable key instead of re-running the side effect on a recovery retry.
* **Approvals** — gate a call behind a human, either inline (the turn waits) or durably (the turn parks and resumes later, even from a dashboard with no live socket).
* **Authorization** — declare the permissions a call requires and grant them per-turn.
* **Reply attachments** — record advisory delivery metadata (a drafted email, a card, a voice note) without changing what the model sees.

Actions compile into Think tools, so the model calls them exactly like any other tool. Return them from `getActions()`; Think merges them into the tool set alongside `getTools()`, workspace tools, extensions, and MCP tools.

## Define an action

Use the `action()` descriptor factory and return a map of actions from `getActions()`. The map key is the tool name the model sees (unless you set `name`). The `execute` input type is inferred from `inputSchema`:

```js
import { Think, action } from "@cloudflare/think";
import { z } from "zod";

export class Support extends Think {
	getActions() {
		return {
			refundOrder: action({
				description: "Refund a customer order.",
				inputSchema: z.object({
					orderId: z.string(),
					amountCents: z.number().int().positive(),
				}),
				execute: async ({ orderId, amountCents }, ctx) => {
					const result = await refund(orderId, amountCents);
					return { refundId: result.id, status: result.status };
				},
			}),
		};
	}
}
```

```ts
import { Think, action } from "@cloudflare/think";
import { z } from "zod";

export class Support extends Think<Env> {
	getActions() {
		return {
			refundOrder: action({
				description: "Refund a customer order.",
				inputSchema: z.object({
					orderId: z.string(),
					amountCents: z.number().int().positive(),
				}),
				execute: async ({ orderId, amountCents }, ctx) => {
					const result = await refund(orderId, amountCents);
					return { refundId: result.id, status: result.status };
				},
			}),
		};
	}
}
```

The `execute` callback receives the validated input and an `ActionContext`:

```ts
type ActionContext = {
	agent: Think;
	env: Cloudflare.Env;
	requestId: string;
	toolCallId: string;
	messages: ReadonlyArray<ModelMessage>;
	signal: AbortSignal; // aborts on turn cancel or after `timeoutMs`
	attachReply(attachment: ReplyAttachment): void;
};
```

The action output is normalized to JSON and truncated before it is shown to the model (long outputs are capped). Anything thrown from `execute` becomes a structured `{ error: { name, message } }` tool result rather than crashing the turn. Each action has a default timeout of 30 seconds; override it per action with `timeoutMs`.

### Actions versus plain tools

A plain `tool()` from `getTools()` still works and is the right choice for a read-only or trivial tool. Reach for `action()` when a tool has side effects you must not run twice, needs human approval, or needs declarative authorization — the ledger, approval descriptors, default timeout, and structured error mapping only apply to actions.

## Idempotency and the action ledger

When an action declares an `idempotencyKey`, Think records the settled result in a durable ledger keyed by `action:<name>:<key>`. If the same key is seen again — on a recovery retry, a reconnect, or a duplicate inbound event — Think returns the stored result **without** re-running `execute`, so the side effect happens at most once on the happy path.

```js
const chargeInvoice = action({
	description: "Charge an invoice.",
	inputSchema: z.object({ invoiceId: z.string() }),
	// Use a stable domain identifier — never a timestamp, request id, or random value.
	idempotencyKey: ({ input }) => `invoice:${input.invoiceId}`,
	execute: async ({ invoiceId }) => charge(invoiceId),
});
```

```ts
const chargeInvoice = action({
	description: "Charge an invoice.",
	inputSchema: z.object({ invoiceId: z.string() }),
	// Use a stable domain identifier — never a timestamp, request id, or random value.
	idempotencyKey: ({ input }) => `invoice:${input.invoiceId}`,
	execute: async ({ invoiceId }) => charge(invoiceId),
});
```

`idempotencyKey` is a string, or a function `({ input, ctx }) => string`. Choose a key that survives recovery retries — an order id, an inbound event id — and not a value that changes per attempt. An action with no `idempotencyKey` falls back to a per-`toolCallId` key, which only deduplicates within the same tool call, not across retries.

### Pending rows and the retry lease

A ledger row is written as `pending` before `execute` runs and flipped to `settled` on success (a thrown or timed-out `execute` deletes the row so the call can be retried cleanly). If the isolate dies mid-execute, the row is left `pending`. By default such a stale row is reclaimed and the action re-run once the row is older than `actionLedgerPendingRetryLeaseMs` (default 5 minutes) — **but only for actions that declare an explicit `idempotencyKey`**, since that key is your assertion that re-running the keyed side effect is safe. A fresh pending row (or one without an explicit key) instead returns an `ActionPendingError` result so the model does not blindly retry an unknown state. Set `actionLedgerPendingRetryLeaseMs = false` to disable reclaim entirely and always surface `ActionPendingError` for a stale row.

## Approvals

Gate an action behind a human with `approval`. There are two mechanisms, selected by `kind`.

### Approval-gated (the turn waits)

The default when you set `approval` without a `kind`. The action compiles to a tool with the AI SDK `needsApproval` flag: the stream pauses with an `approval-requested` part, the client approves or rejects, and the turn continues inline. `execute` runs only after approval.

```js
const deleteAccount = action({
	description: "Permanently delete a user account.",
	inputSchema: z.object({ userId: z.string() }),
	approval: true, // or ({ input }) => input.userId !== currentUser
	approvalSummary: "Delete an account",
	approvalRisk: "high",
	execute: async ({ userId }) => deleteAccount(userId),
});
```

```ts
const deleteAccount = action({
	description: "Permanently delete a user account.",
	inputSchema: z.object({ userId: z.string() }),
	approval: true, // or ({ input }) => input.userId !== currentUser
	approvalSummary: "Delete an account",
	approvalRisk: "high",
	execute: async ({ userId }) => deleteAccount(userId),
});
```

`approval` is a boolean or a predicate `({ input, ctx }) => boolean`, so you can require approval only for risky inputs. `approvalSummary` and `approvalRisk` (`"low" | "medium" | "high"`) populate the approval descriptor your UI renders.

### Durable-pause (the turn parks and resumes later)

Set `kind: "durable-pause"` when approval may take minutes or days and you do not want to hold a connection open. The action parks into a durable store and the turn ends; `execute` does not run yet. Resume later — from anywhere, including a dashboard with no live WebSocket — with `approveExecution()` or `rejectExecution()`:

```js
const deploy = action({
	description: "Deploy to production.",
	inputSchema: z.object({ ref: z.string() }),
	kind: "durable-pause",
	approvalSummary: "Deploy to production",
	approvalRisk: "high",
	permissions: ["deploy:run"],
	execute: async ({ ref }) => deploy(ref),
});
```

```ts
const deploy = action({
	description: "Deploy to production.",
	inputSchema: z.object({ ref: z.string() }),
	kind: "durable-pause",
	approvalSummary: "Deploy to production",
	approvalRisk: "high",
	permissions: ["deploy:run"],
	execute: async ({ ref }) => deploy(ref),
});
```

```js
// List everything waiting on a human (cold-load reconciliation):
const pending = await agent.pendingApprovals();
// [{ executionId, source: "action" | "codemode", descriptor }]

// Approve or reject by execution id (idempotent — a second call is a no-op):
await agent.approveExecution(executionId);
await agent.rejectExecution(executionId, "Not this release");
```

```ts
// List everything waiting on a human (cold-load reconciliation):
const pending = await agent.pendingApprovals();
// [{ executionId, source: "action" | "codemode", descriptor }]

// Approve or reject by execution id (idempotent — a second call is a no-op):
await agent.approveExecution(executionId);
await agent.rejectExecution(executionId, "Not this release");
```

`approveExecution()` runs `execute` once and auto-continues the turn even if no client is connected; `rejectExecution()` resolves the action without running it. `pendingApprovals()` merges parked actions and paused [Codemode](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agents/tools/codemode/) executions, so a single approval UI can drive both. (`durable-pause` requires an `approval` policy — an action that would never park is rejected at definition time.)

Both approval-gated and durable-pause parts carry a stable `ActionApprovalDescriptor` (`{ requestId, toolCallId, action, summary, input, permissions, risk, kind }`) so your UI has everything it needs to render the prompt.

## Authorization

Declare the permissions an action requires with `permissions`, then grant them per turn. By default every turn is fully authorized, so authorization is opt-in.

```js
const refundOrder = action({
	description: "Refund a customer order.",
	inputSchema: z.object({ orderId: z.string() }),
	permissions: ["billing:refund"], // or ({ input }) => [...]
	execute: async ({ orderId }) => refund(orderId),
});
```

```ts
const refundOrder = action({
	description: "Refund a customer order.",
	inputSchema: z.object({ orderId: z.string() }),
	permissions: ["billing:refund"], // or ({ input }) => [...]
	execute: async ({ orderId }) => refund(orderId),
});
```

Override `authorizeTurn()` to decide, once per turn, which permissions are granted. Returning a list narrows the grant; any action requiring a permission outside the set is denied with a structured `ActionAuthorizationError` (the model never calls `execute`):

```js
export class Support extends Think {
	authorizeTurn(ctx) {
		const role = ctx.body?.role;
		if (role === "admin") return true; // full grant (the default)
		return { allowed: true, grantedPermissions: ["billing:read"] };
	}
}
```

```ts
export class Support extends Think<Env> {
	override authorizeTurn(ctx: TurnContext): ActionAuthorizationDecision {
		const role = (ctx.body as { role?: string })?.role;
		if (role === "admin") return true; // full grant (the default)
		return { allowed: true, grantedPermissions: ["billing:read"] };
	}
}
```

`authorizeTurn()` returns `true` (full grant), `false` (deny all), or `{ allowed, reason?, grantedPermissions? }`. For per-call logic, override `authorizeAction(ctx)` instead — it receives the action name, kind, input, and required and granted permissions.

## Reply attachments

An action can record advisory delivery metadata for the turn — a drafted email, a card, a voice note — with `ctx.attachReply()`. Attachments never change the tool output the model sees; they ride alongside the response for your delivery layer to render.

```js
const draftReply = action({
	description: "Draft an email reply.",
	inputSchema: z.object({ to: z.string(), subject: z.string() }),
	execute: async ({ to, subject }, ctx) => {
		ctx.attachReply({ type: "email_draft", to: [to], subject });
		return { drafted: true };
	},
});
```

```ts
const draftReply = action({
	description: "Draft an email reply.",
	inputSchema: z.object({ to: z.string(), subject: z.string() }),
	execute: async ({ to, subject }, ctx) => {
		ctx.attachReply({ type: "email_draft", to: [to], subject });
		return { drafted: true };
	},
});
```

Read the attachments after the turn from the `onChatResponse()` hook, or from the `replyAttachments(requestId?)` getter:

```js
export class Support extends Think {
	async onChatResponse(result) {
		for (const attachment of result.attachments ?? []) {
			// attachment.type === "email_draft" | "card" | "voice_note" | custom
		}
	}
}
```

```ts
export class Support extends Think<Env> {
	override async onChatResponse(result: ChatResponseResult) {
		for (const attachment of result.attachments ?? []) {
			// attachment.type === "email_draft" | "card" | "voice_note" | custom
		}
	}
}
```

Attachments are JSON-normalized and deep-copied on read, capped per turn, and discarded if the `execute` that recorded them fails. A ledger replay does not re-fire attachments (the side effect already happened), and `attachReply()` is a no-op when called from a `permissions`, `approval`, or `idempotencyKey` callback — record attachments from `execute`.

A built-in `ReplyAttachment` covers `email_draft`, `card`, and `voice_note`; any `{ type: string; ... }` shape is allowed for custom delivery. Override [renderAttachment()](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agents/harnesses/think/channels/#deliver-out-of-band) to turn an attachment into a channel notice.
