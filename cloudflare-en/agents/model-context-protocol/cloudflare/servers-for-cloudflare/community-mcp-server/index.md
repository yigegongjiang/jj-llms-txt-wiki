# Cloudflare Community MCP Server

Last updated Jun 3, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agents/model-context-protocol/cloudflare/servers-for-cloudflare/community-mcp-server/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

The MCP server for the [Cloudflare Community forum ↗](https://community.cloudflare.com) lets AI agents search topics, read posts, look up users, and filter content.

The server is powered by [@discourse/mcp ↗](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@discourse/mcp), the official Discourse MCP server.

## Install

```bash
npx @discourse/mcp@latest
```

## Configure

### OpenCode

Add to `~/.config/opencode/opencode.jsonc` inside the `"mcp"` block:

```json
"discourse": {
  "type": "local",
  "command": ["npx", "-y", "@discourse/mcp@latest"],
  "enabled": true
}
```

### Claude Desktop

Add to `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "discourse": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@discourse/mcp@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Cursor

Add to `.cursor/mcp.json` in your project root:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "discourse": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@discourse/mcp@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Connect to the Cloudflare Community

After configuring your client, use the `discourse_select_site` tool with:

```txt
https://community.cloudflare.com
```

No API key is needed for reading public data. An API key is only required for write operations (posting, moderation).
