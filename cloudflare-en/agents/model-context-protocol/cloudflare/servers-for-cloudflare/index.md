# Cloudflare's own MCP servers

Last updated Jul 28, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agents/model-context-protocol/cloudflare/servers-for-cloudflare/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Cloudflare runs a catalog of managed remote MCP servers which you can connect to using OAuth on clients like [Claude ↗](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/user), [Windsurf ↗](https://docs.windsurf.com/windsurf/cascade/mcp), our own [AI Playground ↗](https://playground.ai.cloudflare.com/) or any [SDK that supports MCP ↗](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/tree/main/packages/agents/src/mcp).

These MCP servers allow your MCP client to read configurations from your account, process information, make suggestions based on data, and even make those suggested changes for you. All of these actions can happen across Cloudflare's many services including application development, security and performance.

Use the Streamable HTTP endpoint at `/mcp` for new connections. The servers support the new MCP 2026-07-28 Specification and stateless requests from 2025 Streamable HTTP clients. Historical `/sse` URLs remain available as aliases for the same Streamable HTTP handler, but they do not serve the deprecated HTTP+SSE transport. Clients configured to force SSE transport must switch to Streamable HTTP or automatic transport detection.

## Cloudflare API MCP server

The [Cloudflare API MCP server ↗](https://github.com/cloudflare/mcp) provides access to the entire [Cloudflare API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/) — over 2,500 endpoints across DNS, Workers, R2, Zero Trust, and every other product — through just two tools: `search()` and `execute()`.

It uses [the search-and-execute Code Mode pattern](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agents/model-context-protocol/codemode/#search-and-execute), a technique where the model writes JavaScript against a typed representation of the OpenAPI spec and the Cloudflare API client, rather than loading individual tool definitions for each endpoint. The generated code runs inside an isolated [Dynamic Worker](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/worker-loader/) sandbox.

This approach uses approximately 1,000 tokens regardless of how many API endpoints exist. An equivalent MCP server that exposed every endpoint as a native tool would consume over 1 million tokens — more than the entire context window of most foundation models.

| Approach                          | Tools | Token cost  |
| --------------------------------- | ----- | ----------- |
| Native MCP (full schemas)         | 2,594 | \~1,170,000 |
| Native MCP (required params only) | 2,594 | \~244,000   |
| Code Mode                         | 2     | \~1,000     |

### Connect to the Cloudflare API MCP server

Add the following configuration to your MCP client:

```json
{
	"mcpServers": {
		"cloudflare-api": {
			"url": "https://mcp.cloudflare.com/mcp"
		}
	}
}
```

When you connect, you will be redirected to Cloudflare to authorize via OAuth and select the permissions to grant to your agent.

For CI/CD or automation, you can create a [Cloudflare API token ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens) with the permissions you need and pass it as a bearer token in the `Authorization` header. Both user tokens and account tokens are supported.

For more information, refer to the [Cloudflare MCP repository ↗](https://github.com/cloudflare/mcp).

### Install via agent and IDE plugins

You can install the [Cloudflare Skills plugin ↗](https://github.com/cloudflare/skills), which bundles the Cloudflare MCP servers alongside contextual skills and slash commands for building on Cloudflare. The plugin works with any agent that supports the Agent Skills standard, including Claude Code, OpenCode, OpenAI Codex, and Pi.

#### Claude Code

Install using the [plugin marketplace ↗](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/discover-plugins#add-from-github):

```txt
/plugin marketplace add cloudflare/skills
```

#### Cursor

Install from the **Cursor Marketplace**, or add manually via **Settings** \> **Rules** \> **Add Rule** \> **Remote Rule (Github)** with `cloudflare/skills`.

#### npx skills

Install using the [npx skills ↗](https://skills.sh) CLI:

```sh
npx skills add https://github.com/cloudflare/skills
```

#### Clone or copy

Clone the [cloudflare/skills ↗](https://github.com/cloudflare/skills) repository and copy the skill folders into the appropriate directory for your agent:

| Agent        | Skill directory             | Docs                                                                                                   |
