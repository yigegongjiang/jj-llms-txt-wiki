# Agent Skills

Last updated Jun 3, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agents/runtime/execution/agent-skills/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Agent Skills are on-demand instructions, resources, and scripts. A skill source provides a catalog of skill names and descriptions; the agent adds that catalog to the system prompt and exposes tools the model can use when a user task matches a skill — so a large library of capabilities does not bloat every prompt.

Note

Agent Skills are experimental, and script execution in particular is early. The API may change in a future release.

The skills engine lives in `agents/skills` and is framework-agnostic, so any agent (including a plain [AIChatAgent](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agents/communication-channels/chat/chat-agents/) `onChatMessage`) can build a `SkillRegistry`. [@cloudflare/think](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agents/harnesses/think/) re-exports it as the `skills` namespace and wires `getSkills()` into the turn automatically.

## Using skills with Think

Bundled skills are usually imported with the Agents Vite plugin:

```js
import { Think, skills } from "@cloudflare/think";
import bundledSkills from "agents:skills"; // resolves to ./skills next to this file

export class MyAgent extends Think {
	getSkills() {
		return [
			bundledSkills,
			skills.r2(this.env.SKILLS_BUCKET, { prefix: "skills/" }),
		];
	}

	getSkillScriptRunner() {
		return skills.runner({
			loader: this.env.LOADER,
			workspaceInstance: this.workspace,
		});
	}
}
```

```ts
import { Think, skills } from "@cloudflare/think";
import bundledSkills from "agents:skills"; // resolves to ./skills next to this file

type Env = {
	AI: Ai;
	LOADER: WorkerLoader;
	SKILLS_BUCKET: R2Bucket;
};

export class MyAgent extends Think<Env> {
	getSkills() {
		return [
			bundledSkills,
			skills.r2(this.env.SKILLS_BUCKET, { prefix: "skills/" }),
		];
	}

	getSkillScriptRunner() {
		return skills.runner({
			loader: this.env.LOADER,
			workspaceInstance: this.workspace,
		});
	}
}
```

`agents:skills` resolves to a `./skills` directory next to the importing file; use `agents:skills/<dir>` to point at a differently named sibling directory. The `agents:skills` import is typed by ambient declarations that ship with `agents`, so importing `Think` in the same file brings the type into scope (for a file that imports only the specifier, add `/// <reference types="agents/skills-module" />`). If you are not using the Agents Vite plugin, build a source with `skills.fromManifest(...)` instead.

Sources are applied in order; the first source to register a skill name wins, and later duplicates (or a source that fails to load) are skipped with a logged warning rather than failing the agent.

The imported directory should contain one child directory per skill:

```text
src/skills/release-notes/SKILL.md
src/skills/release-notes/scripts/format-release-notes.ts
src/skills/release-notes/references/style-guide.md
```

## Skill tools

When skills are available, the agent exposes:

| Tool                  | Purpose                                                           |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| activate\_skill       | Load a matching skill's instructions and bundled resource list    |
| read\_skill\_resource | Read a bundled resource by { name, path } or skill-name/path      |
| run\_skill\_script    | Run a bundled script when getSkillScriptRunner() returns a runner |

Skills are not always-on system prompt text. Use `getSystemPrompt()` or a Session context block for behavior that should apply to every turn. Use skills for task-specific procedures, references, scripts, templates, and assets that should be loaded only when relevant.

## Script execution

Script execution is opt-in and requires a Worker Loader binding:

```jsonc
{
	"worker_loaders": [{ "binding": "LOADER" }]
}
```

```toml
[[worker_loaders]]
binding = "LOADER"
```

`skills.runner()` is experimental and runs JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, and Bash scripts under `scripts/`. TypeScript is compiled with `@cloudflare/worker-bundler`; Python runs as Python Dynamic Workers; Bash runs through `just-bash`.

JavaScript and TypeScript scripts are function-style:

```js
export default async function run(input, ctx) {
	const guide = ctx.files["references/style-guide.md"]; // bundled text resources
	const docs = await ctx.workspace.readFile("README.md"); // gated by permission
	const summary = await ctx.tools.call("summarize", { input }); // explicit tools
	await ctx.output.writeFile("notes.md", summary); // scratch artifact
	return { ok: true };
}
```

```ts
import type { SkillRunContext } from "@cloudflare/think";

export default async function run(input: unknown, ctx: SkillRunContext) {
	const guide = ctx.files["references/style-guide.md"]; // bundled text resources
	const docs = await ctx.workspace.readFile("README.md"); // gated by permission
	const summary = await ctx.tools.call("summarize", { input }); // explicit tools
	await ctx.output.writeFile("notes.md", summary); // scratch artifact
	return { ok: true };
}
```

`ctx` is `{ skill, files, workspace, tools, output }`. `ctx.files` holds bundled text resources by relative path, `ctx.workspace` is gated by the workspace permission, `ctx.tools` only exposes tools the runner was given, and `ctx.output.writeFile(name, content)` returns scratch artifacts to the model (it does not mutate the workspace). Python and Bash use the path-based contract instead: `/input.json`, `/context.json`, bundled resources under `/skill`, and `/output` for artifacts.

Passing `workspaceInstance` gives scripts read-only workspace access by default. Network access, tools, and workspace writes are opt-in. The default timeout is 30 seconds.

## Example

```js
import { Think, skills } from "@cloudflare/think";

export class SkillsAgent extends Think {
	getSkills() {
		return [skills.r2(this.env.SKILLS_BUCKET, { prefix: "skills/" })];
	}
}
```

```ts
import { Think, skills } from "@cloudflare/think";

export class SkillsAgent extends Think<Env> {
	getSkills() {
		return [skills.r2(this.env.SKILLS_BUCKET, { prefix: "skills/" })];
	}
}
```
