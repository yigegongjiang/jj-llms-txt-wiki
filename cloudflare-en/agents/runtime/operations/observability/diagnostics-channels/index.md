# Diagnostics channels

Last updated Aug 20, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agents/runtime/operations/observability/diagnostics-channels/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Agents publish structured events to [diagnostics channels](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/nodejs/diagnostics-channel/) for every significant operation -- RPC calls, state changes, schedule execution, workflow transitions, MCP connections, and more. Publishing has zero overhead when nobody is listening.

## Event structure

Every event has these fields:

```ts
{
  type: "rpc",                        // what happened
  agent: "MyAgent",                   // which agent class emitted it
  name: "user-123",                   // which agent instance (Durable Object name)
  payload: { method: "getWeather" },  // details
  timestamp: 1758005142787            // when (ms since epoch)
}
```

`agent` and `name` identify the source agent — `agent` is the class name and `name` is the Durable Object instance name.

## Channels

Events are routed to named channels based on their type:

| Channel            | Event types                                                                                                                                                         | Description                                                            |

## Subscribing to events

### Typed subscribe helper

The `subscribe()` function from `agents/observability` provides type-safe access to events on a specific channel:

```js
import { subscribe } from "agents/observability";

const unsub = subscribe("rpc", (event) => {
	if (event.type === "rpc") {
		console.log(`RPC call: ${event.payload.method}`);
	}
	if (event.type === "rpc:error") {
		console.error(
			`RPC failed: ${event.payload.method} — ${event.payload.error}`,
		);
	}
});

// Clean up when done
unsub();
```

```ts
import { subscribe } from "agents/observability";

const unsub = subscribe("rpc", (event) => {
	if (event.type === "rpc") {
		console.log(`RPC call: ${event.payload.method}`);
	}
	if (event.type === "rpc:error") {
		console.error(
			`RPC failed: ${event.payload.method} — ${event.payload.error}`,
		);
	}
});

// Clean up when done
unsub();
```

The callback is fully typed — `event` is narrowed to only the event types that flow through that channel.

The typed helper uses camelCase keys, so agent-tool recovery is `subscribe("agentTool", ...)`. Raw diagnostics channel subscribers should use the emitted channel name, `agents:agent_tool`.

### Raw diagnostics\_channel

You can also subscribe directly using the Node.js API:

```js
import { subscribe } from "node:diagnostics_channel";

subscribe("agents:schedule", (event) => {
	console.log(event);
});
```

```ts
import { subscribe } from "node:diagnostics_channel";

subscribe("agents:schedule", (event) => {
	console.log(event);
});
```

## Tail Workers (production)

In production, all diagnostics channel messages are automatically forwarded to [Tail Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/observability/logs/tail-workers/). No subscription code is needed in the agent itself — attach a Tail Worker and access events via `event.diagnosticsChannelEvents`:

```js
export default {
	async tail(events) {
		for (const event of events) {
			for (const msg of event.diagnosticsChannelEvents) {
				// msg.channel is "agents:rpc", "agents:workflow", etc.
				// msg.message is the typed event payload
				console.log(msg.timestamp, msg.channel, msg.message);
			}
		}
	},
};
```

```ts
export default {
	async tail(events) {
		for (const event of events) {
			for (const msg of event.diagnosticsChannelEvents) {
				// msg.channel is "agents:rpc", "agents:workflow", etc.
				// msg.message is the typed event payload
				console.log(msg.timestamp, msg.channel, msg.message);
			}
		}
	},
};
```

This gives you structured, filterable observability in production with zero overhead in the agent hot path.

## Custom observability

You can override the default implementation by providing your own `Observability` interface:

```js
import { Agent } from "agents";

const myObservability = {
	emit(event) {
		// Send to your logging service, filter events, etc.
		if (event.type === "rpc:error") {
			console.error(event.payload.method, event.payload.error);
		}
	},
};

class MyAgent extends Agent {
	observability = myObservability;
}
```

```ts
import { Agent } from "agents";
import type { Observability } from "agents/observability";

const myObservability: Observability = {
	emit(event) {
		// Send to your logging service, filter events, etc.
		if (event.type === "rpc:error") {
			console.error(event.payload.method, event.payload.error);
		}
	},
};

class MyAgent extends Agent {
	override observability = myObservability;
}
```

Set `observability` to `undefined` to disable all event emission:

```js
import { Agent } from "agents";

class MyAgent extends Agent {
	observability = undefined;
}
```

```ts
import { Agent } from "agents";

class MyAgent extends Agent {
	override observability = undefined;
}
```

### Chat recovery events

| Type                    | Payload                                                                | When                                                                                                                                 |

| chat:recovery:detected  | { incidentId, requestId, attempt, maxAttempts, recoveryKind }          | An interrupted chat fiber is first observed                                                                                          |
| chat:recovery:attempt   | { incidentId, requestId, attempt, maxAttempts, recoveryKind }          | The framework begins a recovery attempt                                                                                              |

| chat:recovery:skipped   | { incidentId, requestId, attempt, maxAttempts, recoveryKind, reason? } | Recovery was skipped because the conversation changed or was no longer recoverable                                                   |
| chat:recovery:failed    | { incidentId, requestId, attempt, maxAttempts, recoveryKind, reason? } | Recovery ran but failed                                                                                                              |

`recoveryKind` is `"retry"` when recovery replays an unanswered user turn and `"continue"` when it continues a partial assistant turn.

### Chat context events

| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| chat:context:compacted | { reason, shortened, requestId?, attempt? } | Think compacts the session to handle a context-window overflow. reason is "proactive" (the contextOverflow.proactive guard fired before a step) or "reactive" (contextOverflow.reactive fired after an overflow). shortened is whether compaction actually reduced history — false means a retry would overflow again. Refer to [Context-window overflow recovery](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agents/harnesses/think/recovery/#context-window-overflow-recovery). |

### Transcript events

| Type                     | Payload                                                          | When                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| chat:transcript:repaired | { requestId?, removedToolCalls, normalizedInputs, toolCallIds? } | Think repairs a persisted transcript before sending it to the provider. removedToolCalls counts orphaned tool calls healed; normalizedInputs counts stringified or missing tool inputs repaired |

| fiber:recovery:detected | { fiberId, fiberName, managed?, recoveryReason, elapsedMs? }         | Recovery sees an interrupted fiber   |
| fiber:recovery:attempt  | { fiberId, fiberName, managed?, recoveryReason }                     | A recovery hook starts               |
| fiber:recovery:handled  | { fiberId, fiberName, managed?, recoveryReason, status, elapsedMs? } | Recovery handling completes          |
