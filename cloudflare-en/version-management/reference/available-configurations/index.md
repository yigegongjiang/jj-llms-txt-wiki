# Available configurations

Last updated Apr 23, 2026|Copy as Markdown| [View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/version-management/reference/available-configurations/index.md)| [Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

When you use Version Management, you can edit various configurations, such as [WAF custom rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/custom-rules/) and [Cache](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cache/).

Generally, you are allowed to edit all zone-level configurations except for the following:

- [DNS](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/)
- [Spectrum](https://developers.cloudflare.com/spectrum/)
- Traffic ([Load Balancing](https://developers.cloudflare.com/load-balancing/), [Waiting Rooms](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waiting-room/), Health Checks, and more)
- [Zero Trust](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/) and Access policies
- [SSL certificates](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/edge-certificates/) (though you can test these with a separate [staging certificates](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/edge-certificates/staging-environment/) feature)

Note

For the most up-to-date list of these configurations, start [editing configurations within a version](https://developers.cloudflare.com/version-management/how-to/versions/#change-configurations-in-a-version) in the Cloudflare dashboard.
