**Planned model deprecations**
* We are refreshing the Workers AI model catalog to make room for newer releases. Please update your apps to remove references to the models listed below before the deprecation date. Refer to the [changelog](https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/post/2026-05-08-planned-model-deprecations/) for full details.
* We recommend migrating to newer models such as [@cf/zai-org/glm-4.7-flash](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/models/glm-4.7-flash/) for fast tool-calling, [@cf/google/gemma-4-26b-a4b-it](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/models/gemma-4-26b-a4b-it/) for an efficient open model, or [@cf/moonshotai/kimi-k2.6](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/models/kimi-k2.6/) for a capable tool-calling and vision model.
* On May 30, 2026, requests to [@cf/moonshotai/kimi-k2.5](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/models/kimi-k2.5/) will be automatically aliased to [@cf/moonshotai/kimi-k2.6](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/models/kimi-k2.6/), which has a higher price. The deprecation date was extended from May 10, 2026\. Please review the [K2.6 pricing and model capabilities](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/models/kimi-k2.6/) prior to May 30, 2026.
* On May 30, 2026, the following models will be deprecated:
  * `@cf/moonshotai/kimi-k2.5` \--> `@cf/moonshotai/kimi-k2.6`
  * `@hf/meta-llama/meta-llama-3-8b-instruct`

## 2026-03-06

**Deepgram Nova-3 now supports 10 languages with regional variants**
* [@cf/deepgram/nova-3](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/models/nova-3/) now supports 10 languages with regional variants for real-time transcription. Supported languages include English, Spanish, French, German, Hindi, Russian, Portuguese, Japanese, Italian, and Dutch — with regional variants like `en-GB`, `fr-CA`, and `pt-BR`.

## 2026-02-17

**Chat Completions API support for gpt-oss models and tool calling improvements**
* [@cf/openai/gpt-oss-120b](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/models/gpt-oss-120b/) and [@cf/openai/gpt-oss-20b](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/models/gpt-oss-20b/) now support Chat Completions API format. Use `/v1/chat/completions` with a `messages` array, or use `/ai/run` which dynamically detects your input format and accepts Chat Completions (`messages`), legacy Completions (`prompt`), or Responses API (`input`).
* **\[Bug fix\]** Fixed a bug in the schema for multiple text generation models where the `content` field in message objects only accepted string values. The field now properly accepts both string content and array content (structured content parts for multi-modal inputs). This fix applies to all affected chat models including GPT-OSS models, Llama 3.x, Mistral, Qwen, and others.
* **\[Bug fix\]** Tool call round-trips now work correctly. The binding no longer rejects `tool_call_id` values that it generated itself, fixing issues with multi-turn tool calling conversations.
* **\[Bug fix\]** Assistant messages with `content: null` and `tool_calls` are now accepted in both the Workers AI binding and REST API (`/v1/chat/completions`), fixing tool call round-trip failures.
* **\[Bug fix\]** Streaming responses now correctly report `finish_reason` only on the usage chunk, matching OpenAI's streaming behavior and preventing duplicate finish events.
* **\[Bug fix\]** `/v1/chat/completions` now preserves original tool call IDs from models instead of regenerating them. Previously, the endpoint was generating new IDs which broke multi-turn tool calling because AI SDK clients could not match tool results to their original calls.
* **\[Bug fix\]** `/v1/chat/completions` now correctly reports `finish_reason: "tool_calls"` in the final usage chunk when tools are used. Previously, it was hardcoding `finish_reason: "stop"` which caused AI SDK clients to think the conversation was complete instead of executing tool calls.

## 2026-02-13

**GLM-4.7-Flash, @cloudflare/tanstack-ai, and workers-ai-provider v3.1.1**
* [@cf/zai-org/glm-4.7-flash](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/models/glm-4.7-flash/) is now available on Workers AI! A fast and efficient multilingual text generation model optimized for multi-turn tool calling across 100+ languages.

**Adding gpt-oss models to our catalog**
* Check out the [blog](https://blog.cloudflare.com/openai-gpt-oss-on-workers-ai) for more details about the new models
* Take a look at the [gpt-oss-120b](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/models/gpt-oss-120b) and [gpt-oss-20b](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/models/gpt-oss-20b) model pages for more information about schemas, pricing, and context windows

## 2025-04-09

**Pricing correction for @cf/myshell-ai/melotts**
* We've updated our documentation to reflect the correct pricing for melotts: $0.0002 per audio minute, which is actually cheaper than initially stated. The documented pricing was incorrect, where it said users would be charged based on input tokens.

## 2025-03-17

**Minor updates to the model schema for llama-3.2-1b-instruct, whisper-large-v3-turbo, llama-guard**
* [llama-3.2-1b-instruct](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/models/llama-3.2-1b-instruct/) \- updated context window to the accurate 60,000
* [whisper-large-v3-turbo](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/models/whisper-large-v3-turbo/) \- new hyperparameters available
* [llama-guard-3-8b](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/models/llama-guard-3-8b/) \- the messages array must alternate between `user` and `assistant` to function correctly

## 2025-02-21

**Workers AI bug fixes**
* We fixed a bug where `max_tokens` defaults were not properly being respected - `max_tokens` now correctly defaults to `256` as displayed on the model pages. Users relying on the previous behaviour may observe this as a breaking change. If you want to generate more tokens, please set the `max_tokens` parameter to what you need.
* We updated model pages to show context windows - which is defined as the tokens used in the prompt + tokens used in the response. If your prompt + response tokens exceed the context window, the request will error. Please set `max_tokens` accordingly depending on your prompt length and the context window length to ensure a successful response.

**Deprecation announcement for \`@cf/meta/llama-2-7b-chat-int8\`**

We will be deprecating `@cf/meta/llama-2-7b-chat-int8` on 2024-06-30.

Replace the model ID in your code with a new model of your choice:

* [@cf/meta/llama-3-8b-instruct](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/models/llama-3-8b-instruct/) is the newest model in the Llama family (and is currently free for a limited time on Workers AI).
* [@cf/meta/llama-3-8b-instruct-awq](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/models/llama-3-8b-instruct-awq/) is the new Llama 3 in a similar precision to your currently selected model. This model is also currently free for a limited time.

If you do not switch to a different model by June 30th, we will automatically start returning inference from `@cf/meta/llama-3-8b-instruct-awq`.

## 2024-05-29

**Add new public LoRAs and note on LoRA routing**
* Added documentation on [new public LoRAs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/fine-tunes/public-loras/).
* Noted that you can now run LoRA inference with the base model rather than explicitly calling the `-lora` version

## 2024-05-17

**Add OpenAI compatible API endpoints**

Added OpenAI compatible API endpoints for `/v1/chat/completions` and `/v1/embeddings`. For more details, refer to [Configurations](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/configuration/open-ai-compatibility/).

## 2024-04-11

**Add AI native binding**
* Added new AI native binding, you can now run models with `const resp = await env.AI.run(modelName, inputs)`
* Deprecated `@cloudflare/ai` npm package. While existing solutions using the @cloudflare/ai package will continue to work, no new Workers AI features will be supported. Moving to native AI bindings is highly recommended
