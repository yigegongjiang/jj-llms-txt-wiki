## Parameters

prompt

`string`requiredminLength: 1A text description of the image you want to generate

negative\_prompt

`string`Text describing elements to avoid in the generated image

height

`integer`minimum: 256maximum: 2048The height of the generated image in pixels

width

`integer`minimum: 256maximum: 2048The width of the generated image in pixels

▶image\[]

`array`For use with img2img tasks. An array of integers that represent the image data constrained to 8-bit unsigned integer values

image\_b64

`string`For use with img2img tasks. A base64-encoded string of the input image

▶mask\[]

`array`An array representing An array of integers that represent mask image data for inpainting constrained to 8-bit unsigned integer values

num\_steps

`integer`default: 20maximum: 20The number of diffusion steps; higher values can improve quality but take longer

strength

`number`default: 1A value between 0 and 1 indicating how strongly to apply the transformation during img2img tasks; lower values make the output closer to the input image

guidance

`number`default: 7.5Controls how closely the generated image should adhere to the prompt; higher values make the image more aligned with the prompt

seed

`integer`Random seed for reproducibility of the image generation

The binding returns a `ReadableStream` with the output (check the model's output schema).
