description: QwQ is the reasoning model of the Qwen series. Compared with conventional instruction-tuned models, QwQ, which is capable of thinking and reasoning, can achieve significantly enhanced performance in downstream tasks, especially hard problems. QwQ-32B is the medium-sized reasoning model, which is capable of achieving competitive performance against state-of-the-art reasoning models, e.g., DeepSeek-R1, o1-mini.

## Playground

Try out this model with Workers AI LLM Playground. It does not require any setup or authentication and is an instant way to preview and test a model directly in the browser.

[Launch the LLM Playground](https://playground.ai.cloudflare.com/?model=@cf/qwen/qwq-32b)

## Usage

```ts
export interface Env {
  AI: Ai;
}

export default {
  async fetch(request, env): Promise<Response> {

    const messages = [
      { role: "system", content: "You are a friendly assistant" },
      {
        role: "user",
        content: "What is the origin of the phrase Hello, World",
      },
    ];

    const stream = await env.AI.run("@cf/qwen/qwq-32b", {
      messages,
      stream: true,
    });

    return new Response(stream, {
      headers: { "content-type": "text/event-stream" },
    });
  },
} satisfies ExportedHandler<Env>;
```

```ts
export interface Env {
  AI: Ai;
}

export default {
  async fetch(request, env): Promise<Response> {

    const messages = [
      { role: "system", content: "You are a friendly assistant" },
      {
        role: "user",
        content: "What is the origin of the phrase Hello, World",
      },
    ];
    const response = await env.AI.run("@cf/qwen/qwq-32b", { messages });

    return Response.json(response);
  },
} satisfies ExportedHandler<Env>;
```

```py
import os
import requests

ACCOUNT_ID = "your-account-id"
AUTH_TOKEN = os.environ.get("CLOUDFLARE_AUTH_TOKEN")

prompt = "Tell me all about PEP-8"
response = requests.post(
  f"https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/{ACCOUNT_ID}/ai/run/@cf/qwen/qwq-32b",
    headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {AUTH_TOKEN}"},
    json={
      "messages": [
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a friendly assistant"},
        {"role": "user", "content": prompt}
      ]
    }
)
result = response.json()
print(result)
```

```sh
curl https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/$CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID/ai/run/@cf/qwen/qwq-32b \
  -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CLOUDFLARE_AUTH_TOKEN" \
  -d '{ "messages": [{ "role": "system", "content": "You are a friendly assistant" }, { "role": "user", "content": "Why is pizza so good" }]}'

OpenAI compatible endpoints

Workers AI also supports OpenAI compatible API endpoints for `/v1/chat/completions` and `/v1/embeddings`. For more details, refer to [Configurations](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/configuration/open-ai-compatibility/).

## Parameters

### Input

prompt

`string`requiredminLength: 1The input text prompt for the model to generate a response.

guided\_json{}

`object`JSON schema that should be fulfilled for the response.

raw

`boolean`default: falseIf true, a chat template is not applied and you must adhere to the specific model's expected formatting.

stream

`boolean`default: falseIf true, the response will be streamed back incrementally using SSE, Server Sent Events.

max\_tokens

`integer`default: 256The maximum number of tokens to generate in the response.

temperature

`number`default: 0.15minimum: 0maximum: 5Controls the randomness of the output; higher values produce more random results.

top\_p

`number`minimum: 0maximum: 2Adjusts the creativity of the AI's responses by controlling how many possible words it considers. Lower values make outputs more predictable; higher values allow for more varied and creative responses.

top\_k

`integer`minimum: 1maximum: 50Limits the AI to choose from the top 'k' most probable words. Lower values make responses more focused; higher values introduce more variety and potential surprises.

seed

`integer`minimum: 1maximum: 9999999999Random seed for reproducibility of the generation.

repetition\_penalty

`number`minimum: 0maximum: 2Penalty for repeated tokens; higher values discourage repetition.

frequency\_penalty

`number`minimum: 0maximum: 2Decreases the likelihood of the model repeating the same lines verbatim.

presence\_penalty

`number`minimum: 0maximum: 2Increases the likelihood of the model introducing new topics.
