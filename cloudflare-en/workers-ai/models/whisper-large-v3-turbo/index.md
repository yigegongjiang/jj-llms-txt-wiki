## Parameters

▶audio

`one of`required

task

`string`default: transcribeSupported tasks are 'translate' or 'transcribe'.

language

`string`The language of the audio being transcribed or translated.

vad\_filter

`boolean`default: falsePreprocess the audio with a voice activity detection model.

initial\_prompt

`string`A text prompt to help provide context to the model on the contents of the audio.

prefix

`string`The prefix appended to the beginning of the output of the transcription and can guide the transcription result.

beam\_size

`integer`default: 5The number of beams to use in beam search decoding. Higher values may improve accuracy at the cost of speed.

condition\_on\_previous\_text

`boolean`default: trueWhether to condition on previous text during transcription. Setting to false may help prevent hallucination loops.

no\_speech\_threshold

`number`default: 0.6Threshold for detecting no-speech segments. Segments with no-speech probability above this value are skipped.

compression\_ratio\_threshold

`number`default: 2.4Threshold for filtering out segments with high compression ratio, which often indicate repetitive or hallucinated text.

log\_prob\_threshold

`number`default: -1Threshold for filtering out segments with low average log probability, indicating low confidence.

hallucination\_silence\_threshold

`number`Optional threshold (in seconds) to skip silent periods that may cause hallucinations.

▶transcription\_info{}

`object`

text

`string`The complete transcription of the audio.

word\_count

`number`The total number of words in the transcription.

▶segments\[]

`array`

vtt

`string`The transcription in WebVTT format, which includes timing and text information for use in subtitles.
