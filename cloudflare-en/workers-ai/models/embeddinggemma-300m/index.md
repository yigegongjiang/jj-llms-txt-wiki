description: EmbeddingGemma is a 300M parameter, state-of-the-art for its size, open embedding model from Google, built from Gemma 3 (with T5Gemma initialization) and the same research and technology used to create Gemini models. EmbeddingGemma produces vector representations of text, making it well-suited for search and retrieval tasks, including classification, clustering, and semantic similarity search. This model was trained with data in 100+ spoken languages.

## Usage

```ts
export interface Env {
  AI: Ai;
}

export default {
  async fetch(request, env): Promise<Response> {

    // Can be a string or array of strings]
    const stories = [
      "This is a story about an orange cloud",
      "This is a story about a llama",
      "This is a story about a hugging emoji",
    ];

    const embeddings = await env.AI.run(
      "@cf/google/embeddinggemma-300m",
      {
        text: stories,
      }
    );

    return Response.json(embeddings);
  },
} satisfies ExportedHandler<Env>;
```

```py
import os
import requests


ACCOUNT_ID = "your-account-id"
AUTH_TOKEN = os.environ.get("CLOUDFLARE_AUTH_TOKEN")

stories = [
  'This is a story about an orange cloud',
  'This is a story about a llama',
  'This is a story about a hugging emoji'
]

response = requests.post(
  f"https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/{ACCOUNT_ID}/ai/run/@cf/google/embeddinggemma-300m",
  headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {AUTH_TOKEN}"},
  json={"text": stories}
)

print(response.json())
```

```sh
curl https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/$CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID/ai/run/@cf/google/embeddinggemma-300m  \
  -X POST  \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN"  \
  -d '{ "text": ["This is a story about an orange cloud", "This is a story about a llama", "This is a story about a hugging emoji"] }'
```
