# Workers Binding

You can use Workers Bindings to interact with the Batch API.

## Send a Batch request

Send your initial batch inference request by composing a JSON payload containing an array of individual inference requests and the `queueRequest: true` property (which is what controls queueing behavior).

Note

Ensure that the total payload is under 10 MB.

```ts
export interface Env {
	AI: Ai;
}
export default {
	async fetch(request, env): Promise<Response> {
		const embeddings = await env.AI.run(
			"@cf/baai/bge-m3",
			{
				requests: [
					{
						query: "This is a story about Cloudflare",
						contexts: [
							{
								text: "This is a story about an orange cloud",
							},
							{
								text: "This is a story about a llama",
							},
							{
								text: "This is a story about a hugging emoji",
							},
						],
					},
				],
			},
			{ queueRequest: true },
		);

		return Response.json(embeddings);
	},
} satisfies ExportedHandler<Env>;
```

```json
{
	"status": "queued",
	"model": "@cf/baai/bge-m3",
	"request_id": "000-000-000"
}
```

You will get a response with the following values:

* **`status`**: Indicates that your request is queued.
* **`request_id`**: A unique identifier for the batch request.
* **`model`**: The model used for the batch inference.

Of these, the `request_id` is important for when you need to [poll the batch status](#poll-batch-status).

### Poll batch status

Once your batch request is queued, use the `request_id` to poll for its status. During processing, the API returns a status `queued` or `running` indicating that the request is still in the queue or being processed.

```typescript
export interface Env {
	AI: Ai;
}

export default {
	async fetch(request, env): Promise<Response> {
		const status = await env.AI.run("@cf/baai/bge-m3", {
			request_id: "000-000-000",
		});

		return Response.json(status);
	},
} satisfies ExportedHandler<Env>;
```

```json
{
	"responses": [
		{
			"id": 0,
			"result": {
				"response": [
					{ "id": 0, "score": 0.73974609375 },
					{ "id": 1, "score": 0.642578125 },
					{ "id": 2, "score": 0.6220703125 }
				]
			},
			"success": true,
			"external_reference": "reference-1"
		}
	],
	"usage": { "prompt_tokens": 12, "completion_tokens": 0, "total_tokens": 12 }
}
```

When the inference is complete, the API returns a final HTTP status code of `200` along with an array of responses. Each response object corresponds to an individual input prompt, identified by an `id` that maps to the index of the prompt in your original request.
