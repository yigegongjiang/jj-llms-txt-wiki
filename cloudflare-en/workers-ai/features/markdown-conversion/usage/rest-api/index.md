# REST API

Last updated Apr 21, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/features/markdown-conversion/usage/rest-api/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

You can also use the Markdown Conversion REST API to convert your documents into Markdown.

## Prerequisite: Get Workers AI API token

To use the Markdown Conversion service via the REST API, you need an API token with permissions for the [Workers AI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/) REST API. Refer to [Get started with the Workers AI REST API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/get-started/rest-api/) for instructions on obtaining an API token with the correct permissions.

## Transform

This endpoint lets you convert any file given to us into markdown.

```bash
curl https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/{ACCOUNT_ID}/ai/tomarkdown \
  -X POST \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {API_TOKEN}' \
  -F "files=@cat.jpeg" \
  -F "files=@somatosensory.pdf" \
  -F 'conversionOptions={ ... }'
```

Note

You can get your `ACCOUNT_ID` by going to [Workers & Pages on the dashboard](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/account/find-account-and-zone-ids/#find-account-id-workers-and-pages).
