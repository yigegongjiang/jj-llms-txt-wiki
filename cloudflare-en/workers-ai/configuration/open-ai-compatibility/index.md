# OpenAI compatible API endpoints

Last updated Sep 18, 2026|Copy as Markdown| [View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/configuration/open-ai-compatibility/index.md)| [Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Workers AI provides OpenAI-compatible endpoints for [text generation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/models/) through Chat Completions (`/v1/chat/completions`) and for [text embedding models](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/models/) (`/v1/embeddings`). The Responses API (`/v1/responses`) is available only for GPT-OSS models. Easily call Workers AI by swapping the `baseURL` in the standard OpenAI SDK.

  

## Usage

### Chat Completions and embeddings

Most Workers AI text generation models support the OpenAI Chat Completions API. Embedding models support the OpenAI Embeddings API.

Use the [OpenAI JavaScript SDK ↗︎](https://github.com/openai/openai-node) by setting the Workers AI base URL, API token, and model name.

*OpenAI SDK examplejs*

```js
import OpenAI from "openai";

const openai = new OpenAI({
	apiKey: env.CLOUDFLARE_API_KEY,
	baseURL: `https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/${env.CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID}/ai/v1`,
});

const chatCompletion = await openai.chat.completions.create({
	messages: [{ role: "user", content: "Make some robot noises" }],
	model: "@cf/meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct",
});

const embeddings = await openai.embeddings.create({
	model: "@cf/baai/bge-large-en-v1.5",
	input: "I love matcha",
});
```

*cURL examplebash*

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/{account_id}/ai/v1/chat/completions \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer {api_token}" \
  --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '
    {
      "model": "@cf/meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct",
      "messages": [
        {
          "role": "user",
          "content": "how to build a wooden spoon in 3 short steps? give as short as answer as possible"
        }
      ]
    }
'
```

### Fail fast when capacity is unavailable

For synchronous Chat Completions, set `options.rejectIfBusy` in the top-level request body. This makes the request fail instead of waiting in a capacity queue.

OpenAI clients that preserve custom fields can send this option. Clients that remove unknown fields do not apply it, so requests proceed normally.

Refer to [Reject busy requests](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/features/reject-if-busy/) for examples and error behavior.

### Responses API for GPT-OSS

The Responses API is supported only by the [`@cf/openai/gpt-oss-120b`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/models/gpt-oss-120b/) and [`@cf/openai/gpt-oss-20b`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/models/gpt-oss-20b/) models. Responses requests must be non-streaming, only `stream: false` is supported.

*GPT-OSS Responses API examplejs*

```js
import OpenAI from "openai";

const openai = new OpenAI({
	apiKey: env.CLOUDFLARE_API_KEY,
	baseURL: `https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/${env.CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID}/ai/v1`,
});

const response = await openai.responses.create({
	model: "@cf/openai/gpt-oss-120b",
	input: "Talk to me about open source",
});
```

### AI Gateway

These endpoints are also compatible with [AI Gateway](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/usage/providers/workersai/#openai-compatible-endpoints).
