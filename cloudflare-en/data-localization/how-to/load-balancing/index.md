# Load Balancing

Last updated Jul 1, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/data-localization/how-to/load-balancing/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

The following sections describe how to configure Load Balancing with Regional Services and Customer Metadata Boundary to control where load balancing decisions and traffic processing occur.

## Regional Services

You can load balance traffic at different levels of the networking stack depending on the [proxy mode](https://developers.cloudflare.com/load-balancing/understand-basics/proxy-modes/): Layer 7 (`HTTP/S`) and Layer 4 (`TCP`) are supported; however, `DNS-only` is not supported, as it is not [proxied](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/proxy-status/).

To configure Regional Services for hostnames [proxied](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/proxy-status/) (meaning traffic routes through Cloudflare) through Cloudflare and ensure that the Load Balancer is available only in-region, follow these steps for the dashboard or API configuration:

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Load balancing** page.  
[Go to **Load Balancing** ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/:zone/traffic/load-balancing)
2. Follow the steps to [create a load balancer](https://developers.cloudflare.com/load-balancing/load-balancers/create-load-balancer/#create-a-load-balancer).
3. From the **Data Localization** dropdown, select the region you would like to use on your domain.
4. Select **Next** and continue with the regular setup.
5. Select **Save**.

1. Follow the instructions outlined to [create a load balancer](https://developers.cloudflare.com/load-balancing/load-balancers/create-load-balancer/#create-a-load-balancer) via API.
2. Run the [API POST](https://developers.cloudflare.com/data-localization/regional-services/regional-hostnames/#configure-regional-services-via-api) command on the Load Balancer hostname to create a `regional_hostnames` with a specific region.

## Customer Metadata Boundary

[Load Balancing Analytics](https://developers.cloudflare.com/load-balancing/reference/load-balancing-analytics/) are not available outside the US region when using Customer Metadata Boundary.

With Customer Metadata Boundary set to `EU`, **Traffic** \> **Load Balancing Analytics** \> **Overview and Latency** tab in the zone dashboard will not be populated.

Refer to the [Load Balancing documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/load-balancing/) for more information.
