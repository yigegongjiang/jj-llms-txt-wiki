# Logpush datasets

Last updated Aug 27, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/data-localization/metadata-boundary/logpush-datasets/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

[Logpush](https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/logpush/) is a service that automatically streams your Cloudflare log data to a storage destination you control (such as a cloud storage bucket or SIEM).

The table below lists the Logpush [datasets](https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/logpush/logpush-job/datasets/) (categories of log data) that support zones or accounts with Customer Metadata Boundary (CMB) enabled.

* **Level** — Whether this log type is collected per-zone (a single domain on your account) or per-account (across all domains).
* **Respects CMB** — Whether enabling CMB causes this dataset's logs to be stored only in your selected region. If ✅, logs are localized. If ✘, this dataset is not affected by CMB and may be stored outside your selected region.
* **Available with US/EU CMB region** — Whether you can receive this dataset when CMB is set to US or EU.

Caution

If you enable CMB for a region where a dataset is not available (marked ✘ in the US or EU column), Logpush will not deliver any data for that dataset — there is no error notification.

## Footnotes

1. Customer Metadata Boundary does not apply in this case, as these logs are sent directly from the processing location to your configured destination. [↩](#user-content-fnref-1)
