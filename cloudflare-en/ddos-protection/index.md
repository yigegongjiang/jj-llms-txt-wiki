# Cloudflare DDoS Protection

Last updated Aug 14, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ddos-protection/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Detect and mitigate distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks automatically.

Available on all plans

Cloudflare automatically detects and mitigates [distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/what-is-a-ddos-attack/) via our autonomous DDoS systems.

These systems include multiple dynamic mitigation rules exposed as [DDoS attack protection managed rulesets](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ddos-protection/managed-rulesets/). You can customize the mitigation rules included in these rulesets to optimize and tailor the protection to your needs.

---

## Features

[Managed rulesets](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ddos-protection/managed-rulesets/)

Protect against a variety of DDoS attacks across layers 3/4 (network layer) and layer 7 (application layer) of the OSI model.

Use Managed rulesets

[Adaptive DDoS Protection](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ddos-protection/managed-rulesets/adaptive-protection/)

Get increased protection against sophisticated DDoS attacks on layer 7 and layers 3/4.

Use Adaptive DDoS Protection

[Advanced TCP Protection](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ddos-protection/advanced-ddos-systems/overview/advanced-tcp-protection/)

Detect and mitigate sophisticated out-of-state TCP attacks such as randomized and spoofed ACK floods, or SYN and SYN-ACK floods.

Use Advanced TCP Protection

[Advanced DNS Protection](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ddos-protection/advanced-ddos-systems/overview/advanced-dns-protection/)

Protect against DNS-based DDoS attacks, specifically sophisticated and fully randomized DNS attacks such as random prefix attacks.

Use Advanced DNS Protection

[Programmable Flow Protection](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ddos-protection/advanced-ddos-systems/overview/programmable-flow-protection/)

Deploy custom eBPF packet logic across Cloudflare's network to inspect and mitigate DDoS attacks against UDP-based Layer 7 protocols.

Use Programmable Flow Protection
