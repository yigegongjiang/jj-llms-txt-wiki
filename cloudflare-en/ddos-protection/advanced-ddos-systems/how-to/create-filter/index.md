# Create a filter

Last updated Jun 30, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ddos-protection/advanced-ddos-systems/how-to/create-filter/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

A filter modifies Advanced TCP Protection's [execution mode](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ddos-protection/advanced-ddos-systems/concepts/#mode) — monitoring, mitigation (enabled), or disabled — for all incoming packets matching an expression.

Each protection system component (SYN flood protection or out-of-state TCP protection) should have at least one [rule](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ddos-protection/advanced-ddos-systems/concepts/#rule), but filters are optional.

Note

Filters only apply to Advanced TCP Protection.

## Procedure

To create a [filter](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ddos-protection/advanced-ddos-systems/concepts/#filter) for one of the system components:

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **L3/4 DDoS protection** page.  
[Go to **DDoS Managed Rules** ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/network-security/ddos)
2. Go to **Advanced Protection** \> **Advanced TCP Protection**.
3. Under the system component for which you are creating the filter (**SYN Flood Protection** or **Out-of-state TCP Protection**), select **Create** next to the type of filter you want to create:

  * **Mitigation Filter**: The protection system will drop packets matching the filter expression. - **Monitoring Filter**: The protection system will log packets matching the filter expression.
  * **Off Filter**: The protection system will ignore packets matching the filter expression.
4. Under **When incoming packets match**, define a filter expression using the Expression Builder (specifying one or more values for **Field**, **Operator**, and **Value**), or manually enter an expression using the Expression Editor. For more information, refer to [Edit rule expressions](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/rules-language/expressions/edit-expressions/).
5. Select **Save**.

Note

Filters take precedence over rules. For details on how the execution mode is determined, refer to [Determining the execution mode](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ddos-protection/advanced-ddos-systems/concepts/#determining-the-execution-mode).
