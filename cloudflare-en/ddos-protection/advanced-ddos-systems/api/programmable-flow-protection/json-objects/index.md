### Scope

The `scope` field determines where the rule executes:

* `global` — The rule executes at all Cloudflare locations. You can only create one global rule per account.
* `region` — The rule executes at all Cloudflare locations within the specified region.
* `datacenter` — The rule executes only at the specified Cloudflare datacenter.

When multiple rules match a packet, the rule with the most specific scope executes. A datacenter-scoped rule takes precedence over a region-scoped rule, which takes precedence over a global rule.

### Mode

The `mode` field determines how the rule behaves:

* `enabled` — The program runs and its verdict (pass or drop) is applied to packets.
* `disabled` — The rule is inactive and the program does not run.
* `monitoring` — The program runs but packets are never dropped, regardless of the program's verdict. Use this mode to test a program before enabling it.

### Expression

The `expression` field is a [Rules language expression](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/rules-language/expressions/) up to 8,192 characters. The expression filters which packets the rule applies to. Only packets matching the expression are processed by the program.

Supported fields:

* `ip.src`
* `ip.dst`
* `udp.srcport`
* `udp.dstport`

If the expression is empty or omitted, the rule applies to all UDP packets within its scope.
