# Advanced TCP Protection

Last updated May 7, 2026|Copy as Markdown| [View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ddos-protection/advanced-ddos-systems/api/tcp-protection/index.md)| [Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

You can configure Advanced TCP Protection using the Advanced TCP Protection API.

The Advanced TCP Protection API only supports [API token authentication](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/get-started/create-token/).

For examples of API calls, refer to [Common API calls](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ddos-protection/advanced-ddos-systems/api/tcp-protection/examples/).

## Endpoints

To obtain the complete endpoint, append the Advanced TCP Protection API endpoints listed below to the Cloudflare API base URL.

The Cloudflare API base URL is:

```txt
https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4
```

The `{account_id}` argument is the account ID (a hexadecimal string). You can find this value in the Cloudflare dashboard.

The tables in the following sections summarize the available operations.
