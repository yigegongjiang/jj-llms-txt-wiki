# Advanced DNS Protection

Last updated Apr 15, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ddos-protection/advanced-ddos-systems/api/dns-protection/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Use the [Cloudflare API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/) to configure Advanced DNS Protection via API.

For examples of API calls, refer to [Common API calls](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ddos-protection/advanced-ddos-systems/api/dns-protection/examples/).

## Endpoints

To obtain the complete endpoint, append the Advanced DNS Protection API endpoints listed below to the Cloudflare API base URL:

```txt
https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4
```

The `{account_id}` argument is the [account ID](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/account/find-account-and-zone-ids/) (a hexadecimal string). You can find this value in the Cloudflare dashboard.

The following table summarizes the available operations.
