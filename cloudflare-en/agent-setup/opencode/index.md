## Quick start

1. **Install OpenCode**

   Install OpenCode. For npm, Homebrew, Bun, Scoop, or Windows options, see the [OpenCode install guide ↗︎](https://opencode.ai/docs/).

   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://opencode.ai/install | bash
   ```


2. **Install Cloudflare Skills**

   ```bash
   npx skills add https://github.com/cloudflare/skills
   ```


3. **Add Cloudflare MCP servers**

   Add MCP servers to `.opencode.jsonc`. For domain-specific MCP servers, refer to [mcp-server-cloudflare ↗︎](https://github.com/cloudflare/mcp-server-cloudflare). For the full Cloudflare API MCP server (Code Mode), refer to [cloudflare/mcp ↗︎](https://github.com/cloudflare/mcp).

   ```json
   {
     "mcp": {
       "cloudflare": { "type": "remote", "url": "https://mcp.cloudflare.com/mcp", "enabled": true },
       "cloudflare-docs": { "type": "remote", "url": "https://docs.mcp.cloudflare.com/mcp", "enabled": true },
       "cloudflare-bindings": { "type": "remote", "url": "https://bindings.mcp.cloudflare.com/mcp", "enabled": true },

<details>

<summary>Cloudflare Skills

</summary>

Persistent platform context that teaches the agent how Cloudflare works.

Skills are instructions the agent loads on demand. The <a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/skills">cloudflare/skills</a> bundle covers every layer of the platform — so the agent knows your conventions without you re-explaining them.

- agents-sdkBuild, debug, or review Cloudflare Agents SDK applications using the agents package.
- cloudflareDiscover and choose Cloudflare products for apps, APIs, AI agents, storage, networking, and security. Use for architecture and product selection, including when the user describes a need without naming a Cloudflare product; then find the relevant skill or documentation.
- cloudflare-email-serviceImplement or troubleshoot Cloudflare Email Sending and Email Routing integrations and their delivery configuration.
- cloudflare-oneDesign, configure, troubleshoot, or review Cloudflare One Zero Trust and SASE deployments. Use cloudflare-one-migrations for migration planning from other vendors.
- cloudflare-one-migrationsAssess and plan migrations from existing VPN, SWG, or SASE platforms to Cloudflare One, including policy mapping, parity gaps, and rollout.
- durable-objectsBuild, debug, or review Cloudflare Durable Objects code for persistent state and coordination.
- nextjs-on-cloudflareBuild, migrate, and deploy Next.js apps on Cloudflare Workers with vinext. Use when starting a Next.js project on Cloudflare, moving an existing app to Workers, choosing between vinext and OpenNext, or setting up vinext for Workers. For setup, migration, or deployment, install vinext's upstream skills with \`npx skills add cloudflare/vinext\` if missing, then read and follow the applicable skill and docs.
- sandbox-migrate-to-nextMigrate Cloudflare Sandbox apps from stable @cloudflare/sandbox to @cloudflare/sandbox@next (SDK 1.0 preview). Use sandbox-next for apps already on the preview.
- sandbox-nextBuild or maintain Cloudflare Sandbox apps on @cloudflare/sandbox@next (SDK 1.0 preview). Use sandbox-migrate-to-next when porting a stable app.
- sandbox-stableBuild or maintain Cloudflare Sandbox apps on the stable @cloudflare/sandbox package. Use sandbox-next for preview apps and sandbox-migrate-to-next for stable-to-preview migrations.
- turnstile-spinSet up, repair, or migrate to Cloudflare Turnstile bot verification in an existing frontend and backend, including server-side Siteverify.
- web-perfAudit, diagnose, or optimize website loading and interaction performance, Core Web Vitals, and Lighthouse performance scores.
- workers-best-practicesCloudflare Workers best practices for production applications. Use when writing, reviewing, or configuring Workers.
- wranglerRun or troubleshoot Wrangler CLI commands and configure Worker projects for local development, Previews, deployment, and Cloudflare resource management.

<summary>MCP servers

</summary>

Live access to the Cloudflare API, docs, and observability.

MCP servers provide typed tools to call into Cloudflare at runtime. There are two options: <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/code-mode-mcp/">Code Mode</a> — a single server that covers the entire Cloudflare API (2,500+ endpoints in \~1,000 tokens) — or a set of focused, domain-specific servers hosted in the <a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/mcp-server-cloudflare">cloudflare/mcp-server-cloudflare</a> repo. The full catalog is also in the <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/agents/model-context-protocol/cloudflare/servers-for-cloudflare/">MCP servers for Cloudflare</a> docs.

<summary>Wrangler CLI

</summary>

Local dev, deploys, and Workers-specific commands.

Use <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/">Wrangler</a> for local development, deploys, and product-specific commands like <code>wrangler d1 migrations apply</code> or <code>wrangler tail</code>. The bundled **wrangler** Skill teaches the agent when to reach for it.

What’s next

The unified <code>cf</code> CLI is in technical preview — a next-generation CLI that covers every Cloudflare product with consistent verbs and ergonomic output for agents. Try it with <code>npx cf</code>. <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cf-cli-local-explorer/">Read the announcement →</a>

</details>

<details>

<summary>Agent-friendly docs

</summary>

Token-efficient references optimized for agents.

Append <code>/index.md</code> to any Cloudflare docs URL for a clean markdown version. Every top-level product section also has its own <code>llms.txt</code> — a page index sized for a single context window. A few useful ones:

- <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/llms.txt">developers.cloudflare.com/llms.txt</a> — directory of every Cloudflare product.
- <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/llms.txt">developers.cloudflare.com/workers/llms.txt</a>
- <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/agents/llms.txt">developers.cloudflare.com/agents/llms.txt</a>
- <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/llms.txt">developers.cloudflare.com/r2/llms.txt</a>
- <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/llms.txt">developers.cloudflare.com/d1/llms.txt</a>

For a full overview of how these docs are structured for agents, refer to the <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/docs-for-agents/">Docs for Agents guide</a>.

## Example prompts

```txt
Build a multi-tenant SaaS backend where each customer gets an isolated D1 database.
```

```txt
Add mTLS authentication and schema validation to protect my API endpoints.
```

```txt
Add real-time collaboration to my app using Durable Objects with WebSocket hibernation.
```

```txt
Set up WAF rules to block SQL injection and XSS attacks on my application.
```

```txt
Add a D1 database to my Worker and create a users table with full CRUD endpoints.
```

## Tips

- The Cloudflare API MCP server uses Code Mode — OpenCode writes JavaScript to reach any of 2,500+ endpoints in \~1,000 tokens.
- OpenCode supports 75+ LLMs — you can use Cloudflare Workers AI as the model provider for a fully Cloudflare-native workflow.
- Use OpenCode's plan agent (Tab key) to break down complex Workers projects before coding — pair it with `/cloudflare:build-agent` or `/cloudflare:build-mcp` slash commands.

## FAQ

<details>

<summary>Should I use Skills, the MCP server, Wrangler CLI, or all of them?

</summary>

All three. Skills provide persistent Cloudflare expertise so OpenCode knows when to reach for Durable Objects vs KV, how to structure a Workers project, and when to call CLI vs API. The Cloudflare API MCP server handles platform operations (DNS, WAF, Zero Trust, R2 buckets). Wrangler handles local dev, deploys, and Workers-specific commands. The bundled <code>wrangler</code> Skill teaches OpenCode which to use.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How do I connect OpenCode to Cloudflare?

</summary>

The first time OpenCode calls a Cloudflare tool, you will be redirected to authorize via OAuth and choose permissions.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Can I use Workers AI as the model provider in OpenCode?

</summary>

Yes. OpenCode supports 75+ model providers, including Cloudflare Workers AI. Configure your model in <code>.opencode.jsonc</code>.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Is OpenCode open source?

</summary>

Yes. OpenCode is fully open source and available at <a href="https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode">github.com/anomalyco/opencode</a>.

</details>

## Troubleshooting

<details>

<summary>MCP server connection fails

</summary>

Verify the MCP configuration in <code>.opencode.jsonc</code> uses <code>"type": "remote"</code> with the correct URL. Run <code>opencode mcp list</code> to check connected servers.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Getting outdated information about Cloudflare products

</summary>

Enable the <a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/mcp-server-cloudflare">Cloudflare docs MCP server</a> so the agent can fetch current documentation at runtime. If you prefer not to use the MCP server, point the agent directly at <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/llms.txt">developers.cloudflare.com/llms.txt</a> for a directory of every product, or <code>developers.cloudflare.com/&lt;product&gt;/llms.txt</code> for a product-specific index.
