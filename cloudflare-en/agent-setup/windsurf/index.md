## Cloudflare platform access

Expand any section to learn more.

Cloudflare Skills

Persistent platform context that teaches the agent how Cloudflare works.

Skills are instructions the agent loads on demand. The [cloudflare/skills](https://github.com/cloudflare/skills) bundle covers every layer of the platform — so the agent knows your conventions without you re-explaining them.

* agents-sdkBuild AI agents on Cloudflare Workers using the Agents SDK. Load when creating stateful agents, durable workflows, real-time WebSocket apps, scheduled tasks, MCP servers, chat applications, voice agents, or browser automation. Covers Agent class, state management, callable RPC, Workflows, durable execution, queues, retries, observability, and React hooks. Biases towards retrieval from Cloudflare docs over pre-trained knowledge.
* cloudflareComprehensive Cloudflare platform skill covering Workers, Pages, storage (KV, D1, R2), AI (Workers AI, Vectorize, Agents SDK), feature flags (Flagship), networking (Tunnel, Spectrum), security (WAF, DDoS), and infrastructure-as-code (Terraform, Pulumi). Use for any Cloudflare development task. Biases towards retrieval from Cloudflare docs over pre-trained knowledge.
* cloudflare-email-serviceSend and receive transactional emails with Cloudflare Email Service (Email Sending + Email Routing). Use when building email sending (Workers binding or REST API), email routing, Agents SDK email handling, or integrating email into any app — Workers, Node.js, Python, Go, etc. Also use for email deliverability, SPF/DKIM/DMARC, wrangler email setup, MCP email tools, or when a coding agent needs to send emails. Even for simple requests like "add email to my Worker" — this skill has critical config details.
* cloudflare-one"Guides Cloudflare One Zero Trust and SASE work across Access, Gateway, WARP, Tunnel, Cloudflare WAN, DLP, CASB, device posture, and identity. Use when designing, configuring, troubleshooting, or reviewing Cloudflare One deployments. Retrieval-first: use current Cloudflare docs/API schemas instead of embedded product docs."
* cloudflare-one-migrationsPlans migrations from Zscaler ZIA/ZPA, Palo Alto, legacy VPN, SWG, or SASE stacks to Cloudflare One. Use for migration assessments, policy mapping, rollout plans, and parity/gap analysis.
* durable-objectsCreate and review Cloudflare Durable Objects. Use when building stateful coordination (chat rooms, multiplayer games, booking systems), implementing RPC methods, SQLite storage, alarms, WebSockets, or reviewing DO code for best practices. Covers Workers integration, wrangler config, and testing with Vitest. Biases towards retrieval from Cloudflare docs over pre-trained knowledge.
* sandbox-migrate-to-nextUse when porting a Cloudflare Sandbox app from stable @cloudflare/sandbox to @cloudflare/sandbox@next (Sandbox SDK 1.0 preview), or when the user asks to migrate or upgrade to Sandbox 1.0 / @next. Not for day-to-day stable work (sandbox-stable) or new @next apps (sandbox-next).
* sandbox-nextUse when building or changing Cloudflare Sandbox apps on @cloudflare/sandbox@next (Sandbox SDK 1.0 preview)—code execution, AI runners, interpreters, CI-like jobs, terminals, files, mounts, tunnels, preview URLs, lifecycle, or errors. Not for the default stable package (use sandbox-stable) or for porting stable to @next (use sandbox-migrate-to-next).
* sandbox-stableUse when building or changing Cloudflare Sandbox apps on the current stable @cloudflare/sandbox package (default npm tag)—commands, sessions, files, ports, tunnels, terminals, bridge, production, or deprecated-API cleanup while staying on stable. Not for @cloudflare/sandbox@next (use sandbox-next) or for porting to 1.0 (use sandbox-migrate-to-next).
* turnstile-spinSet up Cloudflare Turnstile end-to-end in a project. Scan the codebase, create the widget via the Cloudflare API, embed it where user requests need bot verification (form submissions, SPA actions, API endpoints, download links, comment or vote submissions, etc.), wire canonical server-side siteverify in the customer's existing backend, validate, and persist the skill. Load this when a user asks to add Turnstile, set up CAPTCHA, protect a form or endpoint from bots, or fix a Turnstile integration. Mirrors developers.cloudflare.com/turnstile/spin.
* web-perfAnalyzes web performance using Chrome DevTools MCP. Measures Core Web Vitals (LCP, INP, CLS) and supplementary metrics (FCP, TBT, Speed Index), identifies render-blocking resources, network dependency chains, layout shifts, caching issues, and accessibility gaps. Use when asked to audit, profile, debug, or optimize page load performance, Lighthouse scores, or site speed. Biases towards retrieval from current documentation over pre-trained knowledge.
* workers-best-practicesReviews and authors Cloudflare Workers code against production best practices. Load when writing new Workers, reviewing Worker code, configuring wrangler.jsonc, or checking for common Workers anti-patterns (streaming, floating promises, global state, secrets, bindings, observability). Biases towards retrieval from Cloudflare docs over pre-trained knowledge.
* wranglerCloudflare Workers CLI for deploying, developing, and managing Workers, KV, R2, D1, Vectorize, Hyperdrive, Workers AI, Containers, Queues, Workflows, Pipelines, and Secrets Store. Load before running wrangler commands to ensure correct syntax and best practices. Biases towards retrieval from Cloudflare docs over pre-trained knowledge.

MCP servers

Live access to the Cloudflare API, docs, and observability.

MCP servers provide typed tools to call into Cloudflare at runtime. There are two options: [Code Mode](https://blog.cloudflare.com/code-mode-mcp/) — a single server that covers the entire Cloudflare API (2,500+ endpoints in \~1,000 tokens) — or a set of focused, domain-specific servers hosted in the [cloudflare/mcp-server-cloudflare](https://github.com/cloudflare/mcp-server-cloudflare) repo. The full catalog is also in the [MCP servers for Cloudflare](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agents/model-context-protocol/cloudflare/servers-for-cloudflare/) docs.

Wrangler CLI

Local dev, deploys, and Workers-specific commands.

Use [Wrangler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/) for local development, deploys, and product-specific commands like `wrangler d1 migrations apply` or `wrangler tail`. The bundled **wrangler** Skill teaches the agent when to reach for it.

What’s next

The unified `cf` CLI is in technical preview — a next-generation CLI that covers every Cloudflare product with consistent verbs and ergonomic output for agents. Try it with `npx cf`. [Read the announcement →](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cf-cli-local-explorer/)

Agent-friendly docs

Token-efficient references optimized for agents.

Append `/index.md` to any Cloudflare docs URL for a clean markdown version. Every top-level product section also has its own `llms.txt` — a page index sized for a single context window. A few useful ones:

* [developers.cloudflare.com/llms.txt](https://developers.cloudflare.com/llms.txt) — directory of every Cloudflare product.
* [developers.cloudflare.com/workers/llms.txt](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/llms.txt)
* [developers.cloudflare.com/agents/llms.txt](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agents/llms.txt)
* [developers.cloudflare.com/r2/llms.txt](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/llms.txt)
* [developers.cloudflare.com/d1/llms.txt](https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/llms.txt)

For a full overview of how these docs are structured for agents, refer to the [Docs for Agents guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/docs-for-agents/).

## Example prompts

```txt
Configure caching rules and cache TTLs to reduce origin load for my e-commerce store.
```

```txt
Build a serverless AI inference endpoint on Workers AI with streaming responses.
```

```txt
Set up a Waiting Room to handle flash sale traffic spikes without dropping requests.
```

```txt
Optimize my Worker to serve WebP images with responsive resizing using Cloudflare Images.
```

```txt
Set up GitHub Actions to deploy this Worker to staging and production on Cloudflare.
```

## Tips

* The Cloudflare API MCP server uses Code Mode — Cascade writes JavaScript to reach any of 2,500+ endpoints in \~1,000 tokens.
* Use `@`\-mention to include your `wrangler.jsonc` in Cascade prompts — Cascade uses this to understand your current bindings when generating code.
* Add the observability MCP server to let Cascade automatically check Workers logs and debug deployments without leaving the IDE.

## FAQ

Does Windsurf support Cloudflare Skills?

Yes. Windsurf supports Agent Skills in Cascade. Install the Cloudflare Skills bundle from [cloudflare/skills ↗](https://github.com/cloudflare/skills)— see the [Windsurf Cascade Skills documentation ↗](https://docs.windsurf.com/windsurf/cascade/skills) for where Cascade discovers and loads Skills.

Should I use Skills, the MCP server, Wrangler CLI, or all of them?

All three complement each other. Cloudflare Skills teach Cascade the patterns and conventions for Workers development. The Cloudflare API MCP server handles platform operations (DNS, WAF, Zero Trust, R2 buckets). Wrangler in Windsurf's integrated terminal covers local dev and deploys. Cascade coordinates between them naturally.

Can Cascade deploy to Cloudflare?

Yes. Cascade can run `npx wrangler deploy` in the integrated terminal, and with the MCP server configured it can also call the Cloudflare API directly for managed deploys and resource creation.

## Troubleshooting

MCP server not connecting

Verify your `mcp_config.json` configuration. Restart Windsurf after making changes. Ensure the MCP server URL ends with `/mcp`.

Getting outdated information about Cloudflare products

Enable the [Cloudflare docs MCP server](https://github.com/cloudflare/mcp-server-cloudflare) so the agent can fetch current documentation at runtime. If you prefer not to use the MCP server, point the agent directly at [developers.cloudflare.com/llms.txt](https://developers.cloudflare.com/llms.txt) for a directory of every product, or `developers.cloudflare.com/<product>/llms.txt`for a product-specific index.
