[Cloudflare Skills ↗](https://github.com/cloudflare/skills)[Cloudflare Code Mode API MCP ↗](https://github.com/cloudflare/mcp)[Cloudflare Domain Specific MCPs ↗](https://github.com/cloudflare/mcp-server-cloudflare)[Claude Code Docs ↗](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code)

## Quick start

1. **Install Claude Code**  
Install the Claude Code CLI. For Windows, Homebrew, WinGet, or npm, see the [Claude Code setup guide ↗](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/setup).  
```bash  
curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash  
```
2. **Launch Claude Code in your project**  
Start Claude Code from the root of your project, where `wrangler.jsonc` lives (if it already exists).  
```bash  
claude  
```
3. **Install the Cloudflare plugin**  
In Claude Code, run these two slash commands. This installs Cloudflare Skills and registers the Cloudflare MCP servers.  
```txt  
/plugin marketplace add cloudflare/skills  
/plugin install cloudflare@cloudflare  
```
4. **Try a prompt**  
For example:  
```txt  
Use Workers for Platforms to let my customers deploy their own code in isolated environments.  
```

Cloudflare Skills

Persistent platform context that teaches the agent how Cloudflare works.

Skills are instructions the agent loads on demand. The [cloudflare/skills](https://github.com/cloudflare/skills) bundle covers every layer of the platform — so the agent knows your conventions without you re-explaining them.

* agents-sdkBuild AI agents on Cloudflare Workers using the Agents SDK. Load when creating stateful agents, durable workflows, real-time WebSocket apps, scheduled tasks, MCP servers, chat applications, voice agents, or browser automation. Covers Agent class, state management, callable RPC, Workflows, durable execution, queues, retries, observability, and React hooks. Biases towards retrieval from Cloudflare docs over pre-trained knowledge.
* cloudflareComprehensive Cloudflare platform skill covering Workers, Pages, storage (KV, D1, R2), AI (Workers AI, Vectorize, Agents SDK), feature flags (Flagship), networking (Tunnel, Spectrum), security (WAF, DDoS), and infrastructure-as-code (Terraform, Pulumi). Use for any Cloudflare development task. Biases towards retrieval from Cloudflare docs over pre-trained knowledge.
* cloudflare-email-serviceSend and receive transactional emails with Cloudflare Email Service (Email Sending + Email Routing). Use when building email sending (Workers binding or REST API), email routing, Agents SDK email handling, or integrating email into any app — Workers, Node.js, Python, Go, etc. Also use for email deliverability, SPF/DKIM/DMARC, wrangler email setup, MCP email tools, or when a coding agent needs to send emails. Even for simple requests like "add email to my Worker" — this skill has critical config details.
* cloudflare-one"Guides Cloudflare One Zero Trust and SASE work across Access, Gateway, WARP, Tunnel, Cloudflare WAN, DLP, CASB, device posture, and identity. Use when designing, configuring, troubleshooting, or reviewing Cloudflare One deployments. Retrieval-first: use current Cloudflare docs/API schemas instead of embedded product docs."
* cloudflare-one-migrationsPlans migrations from Zscaler ZIA/ZPA, Palo Alto, legacy VPN, SWG, or SASE stacks to Cloudflare One. Use for migration assessments, policy mapping, rollout plans, and parity/gap analysis.
* durable-objectsCreate and review Cloudflare Durable Objects. Use when building stateful coordination (chat rooms, multiplayer games, booking systems), implementing RPC methods, SQLite storage, alarms, WebSockets, or reviewing DO code for best practices. Covers Workers integration, wrangler config, and testing with Vitest. Biases towards retrieval from Cloudflare docs over pre-trained knowledge.
* sandbox-sdkBuild sandboxed applications for secure code execution. Load when building AI code execution, code interpreters, CI/CD systems, interactive dev environments, or executing untrusted code. Covers Sandbox SDK lifecycle, commands, files, code interpreter, and preview URLs. Biases towards retrieval from Cloudflare docs over pre-trained knowledge.
* turnstile-spinSet up Cloudflare Turnstile end-to-end in a project. Scan the codebase, create the widget via the Cloudflare API, embed it on the right forms, wire canonical server-side siteverify in the customer's existing backend, validate, and persist the skill. Load this when a user asks to add Turnstile, set up CAPTCHA, protect a form from bots, or fix a Turnstile integration. Mirrors developers.cloudflare.com/turnstile/spin.
* web-perfAnalyzes web performance using Chrome DevTools MCP. Measures Core Web Vitals (LCP, INP, CLS) and supplementary metrics (FCP, TBT, Speed Index), identifies render-blocking resources, network dependency chains, layout shifts, caching issues, and accessibility gaps. Use when asked to audit, profile, debug, or optimize page load performance, Lighthouse scores, or site speed. Biases towards retrieval from current documentation over pre-trained knowledge.
* workers-best-practicesReviews and authors Cloudflare Workers code against production best practices. Load when writing new Workers, reviewing Worker code, configuring wrangler.jsonc, or checking for common Workers anti-patterns (streaming, floating promises, global state, secrets, bindings, observability). Biases towards retrieval from Cloudflare docs over pre-trained knowledge.
* wranglerCloudflare Workers CLI for deploying, developing, and managing Workers, KV, R2, D1, Vectorize, Hyperdrive, Workers AI, Containers, Queues, Workflows, Pipelines, and Secrets Store. Load before running wrangler commands to ensure correct syntax and best practices. Biases towards retrieval from Cloudflare docs over pre-trained knowledge.

MCP servers

Live access to the Cloudflare API, docs, and observability.

MCP servers provide typed tools to call into Cloudflare at runtime. There are two options: [Code Mode](https://blog.cloudflare.com/code-mode-mcp/) — a single server that covers the entire Cloudflare API (2,500+ endpoints in \~1,000 tokens) — or a set of focused, domain-specific servers hosted in the [cloudflare/mcp-server-cloudflare](https://github.com/cloudflare/mcp-server-cloudflare) repo. The full catalog is also in the [MCP servers for Cloudflare](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agents/model-context-protocol/cloudflare/servers-for-cloudflare/) docs.

Wrangler CLI

Local dev, deploys, and Workers-specific commands.

Use [Wrangler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/) for local development, deploys, and product-specific commands like `wrangler d1 migrations apply` or `wrangler tail`. The bundled **wrangler** Skill teaches the agent when to reach for it.

What’s next

The unified `cf` CLI is in technical preview — a next-generation CLI that covers every Cloudflare product with consistent verbs and ergonomic output for agents. Try it with `npx cf`. [Read the announcement →](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cf-cli-local-explorer/)

Agent-friendly docs

Token-efficient references optimized for agents.

Append `/index.md` to any Cloudflare docs URL for a clean markdown version. Every top-level product section also has its own `llms.txt` — a page index sized for a single context window. A few useful ones:

* [developers.cloudflare.com/llms.txt](https://developers.cloudflare.com/llms.txt) — directory of every Cloudflare product.
* [developers.cloudflare.com/workers/llms.txt](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/llms.txt)
* [developers.cloudflare.com/agents/llms.txt](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agents/llms.txt)
* [developers.cloudflare.com/r2/llms.txt](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/llms.txt)
* [developers.cloudflare.com/d1/llms.txt](https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/llms.txt)

For a full overview of how these docs are structured for agents, refer to the [Docs for Agents guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/docs-for-agents/).

## Tips

* The Skills plugin includes a wrangler Skill — Claude knows when to reach for `npx wrangler deploy`, `wrangler d1 migrations apply`, and other CLI commands automatically.
* Try the `/cloudflare:build-agent` slash command to scaffold a complete Agents SDK project, or `/cloudflare:build-mcp` for a remote MCP server.
* The Cloudflare API MCP server uses Code Mode — Claude writes JavaScript against a TypeScript API to hit any of 2,500+ endpoints in \~1,000 tokens.
* Claude Code works best from the root of your Workers project where `wrangler.jsonc` lives — this is what the agent uses to understand your bindings.
* Use `claude mcp list` to verify Cloudflare servers are connected. For CI/CD, skip OAuth by passing a Cloudflare API token as a bearer token instead.
* For more information on installing additional MCP servers, or when to use Code Mode versus traditional MCP servers, refer to the [Cloudflare MCP server repository ↗](https://github.com/cloudflare/mcp-server-cloudflare).

## FAQ

Should I use Skills, the MCP server, Wrangler CLI, or all of them?

All three — and the Skills plugin configures them together. Skills give Claude persistent Cloudflare knowledge (when to use Durable Objects vs KV, what a good Workers project layout looks like). The Cloudflare API MCP server handles platform operations (DNS, WAF, R2 buckets, Zero Trust). Wrangler runs local dev and Workers-specific commands. The `wrangler` Skill teaches Claude when to reach for which.

How do I give Claude Code access to my Cloudflare account?

The first time Claude calls a Cloudflare tool, you will be redirected to authorize via OAuth and choose what permissions to grant.

Can Claude Code deploy to existing Workers projects?

Yes. Run Claude Code from your existing project directory where `wrangler.jsonc` is located, and it will understand your project configuration and deploy accordingly.

What does Code Mode mean for MCP?

Code Mode is how the Cloudflare API MCP server fits all 2,500+ API endpoints into \~1,000 tokens. Instead of exposing every endpoint as a separate tool, it exposes two — `search()` and `execute()` — and Claude writes JavaScript to call them. [Learn more about Code Mode ↗](https://blog.cloudflare.com/code-mode-mcp/).

## Troubleshooting

MCP server connection fails or times out

Run `claude mcp list` to verify the server is registered. Try removing and re-adding: `claude mcp remove cloudflare` then re-add it. Ensure you have `npx` and `mcp-remote` available.

Claude cannot authenticate with Cloudflare

The MCP server uses OAuth. When prompted, complete the authorization flow in your browser. For CI/CD, create a Cloudflare API token and pass it as a bearer token instead.

Getting outdated information about Cloudflare products

Enable the [Cloudflare docs MCP server](https://github.com/cloudflare/mcp-server-cloudflare) so the agent can fetch current documentation at runtime. If you prefer not to use the MCP server, point the agent directly at [developers.cloudflare.com/llms.txt](https://developers.cloudflare.com/llms.txt) for a directory of every product, or `developers.cloudflare.com/<product>/llms.txt`for a product-specific index.
