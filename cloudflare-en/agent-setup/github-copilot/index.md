# GitHub Copilot + Cloudflare

Editor extension and CLI with agent mode, workspace context, and native PR integration. Made by GitHub.

TerminalCloudExtension

[Cloudflare Skills](https://github.com/cloudflare/skills)·[Cloudflare Code Mode API MCP](https://github.com/cloudflare/mcp)·[Cloudflare Domain Specific MCPs](https://github.com/cloudflare/mcp-server-cloudflare)·[GitHub Copilot Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot)

## Quick start

1. **Install GitHub Copilot**  
Install the GitHub Copilot extension in VS Code from the [Visual Studio Marketplace ↗](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot). For JetBrains IDEs, Visual Studio, or Xcode, see the [Install the Copilot extension ↗](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/set-up/install-copilot-extension) guide.
2. **Install Cloudflare Skills**  
```bash  
npx skills add https://github.com/cloudflare/skills  
```
3. **Configure Cloudflare MCP servers**  
For VS Code, add to `.vscode/mcp.json`. For Copilot CLI, add to `~/.copilot/mcp-config.json` for user-level configuration or `.mcp.json` or `.github/mcp.json` for project-level configuration. For domain-specific MCP servers, refer to [mcp-server-cloudflare ↗](https://github.com/cloudflare/mcp-server-cloudflare). For the full Cloudflare API MCP server (Code Mode), refer to [cloudflare/mcp ↗](https://github.com/cloudflare/mcp).  
```json  
{  
  "mcpServers": {  
    "cloudflare": { "url": "https://mcp.cloudflare.com/mcp" },  
    "cloudflare-docs": { "url": "https://docs.mcp.cloudflare.com/mcp" },  
    "cloudflare-bindings": { "url": "https://bindings.mcp.cloudflare.com/mcp" },  
    "cloudflare-builds": { "url": "https://builds.mcp.cloudflare.com/mcp" },  
    "cloudflare-observability": { "url": "https://observability.mcp.cloudflare.com/mcp" }  
  }  
}  
```  
Note  
In Visual Studio Code, `.vscode/mcp.json` uses `servers` as the root key instead of `mcpServers`. For the Visual Studio Code setup, refer to the [Visual Studio Code guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/visual-studio-code/).
4. **Try a prompt**  
Open Copilot Chat (**Ctrl+Shift+I**), switch to agent mode, and try a prompt — for example:  
```txt  
Add real-time collaboration to my app using Durable Objects with WebSocket hibernation.  
```

## Cloudflare platform access

Expand any section to learn more.

Cloudflare Skills

Persistent platform context that teaches the agent how Cloudflare works.

Skills are instructions the agent loads on demand. The [cloudflare/skills](https://github.com/cloudflare/skills) bundle covers every layer of the platform — so the agent knows your conventions without you re-explaining them.

* agents-sdkBuild AI agents on Cloudflare Workers using the Agents SDK. Load when creating stateful agents, durable workflows, real-time WebSocket apps, scheduled tasks, MCP servers, chat applications, voice agents, or browser automation. Covers Agent class, state management, callable RPC, Workflows, durable execution, queues, retries, observability, and React hooks. Biases towards retrieval from Cloudflare docs over pre-trained knowledge.
* cloudflareComprehensive Cloudflare platform skill covering Workers, Pages, storage (KV, D1, R2), AI (Workers AI, Vectorize, Agents SDK), feature flags (Flagship), networking (Tunnel, Spectrum), security (WAF, DDoS), and infrastructure-as-code (Terraform, Pulumi). Use for any Cloudflare development task. Biases towards retrieval from Cloudflare docs over pre-trained knowledge.
* cloudflare-email-serviceSend and receive transactional emails with Cloudflare Email Service (Email Sending + Email Routing). Use when building email sending (Workers binding or REST API), email routing, Agents SDK email handling, or integrating email into any app — Workers, Node.js, Python, Go, etc. Also use for email deliverability, SPF/DKIM/DMARC, wrangler email setup, MCP email tools, or when a coding agent needs to send emails. Even for simple requests like "add email to my Worker" — this skill has critical config details.
* cloudflare-one"Guides Cloudflare One Zero Trust and SASE work across Access, Gateway, WARP, Tunnel, Cloudflare WAN, DLP, CASB, device posture, and identity. Use when designing, configuring, troubleshooting, or reviewing Cloudflare One deployments. Retrieval-first: use current Cloudflare docs/API schemas instead of embedded product docs."
* cloudflare-one-migrationsPlans migrations from Zscaler ZIA/ZPA, Palo Alto, legacy VPN, SWG, or SASE stacks to Cloudflare One. Use for migration assessments, policy mapping, rollout plans, and parity/gap analysis.
* durable-objectsCreate and review Cloudflare Durable Objects. Use when building stateful coordination (chat rooms, multiplayer games, booking systems), implementing RPC methods, SQLite storage, alarms, WebSockets, or reviewing DO code for best practices. Covers Workers integration, wrangler config, and testing with Vitest. Biases towards retrieval from Cloudflare docs over pre-trained knowledge.
* sandbox-migrate-to-nextUse when porting a Cloudflare Sandbox app from stable @cloudflare/sandbox to @cloudflare/sandbox@next (Sandbox SDK 1.0 preview), or when the user asks to migrate or upgrade to Sandbox 1.0 / @next. Not for day-to-day stable work (sandbox-stable) or new @next apps (sandbox-next).
* sandbox-nextUse when building or changing Cloudflare Sandbox apps on @cloudflare/sandbox@next (Sandbox SDK 1.0 preview)—code execution, AI runners, interpreters, CI-like jobs, terminals, files, mounts, tunnels, preview URLs, lifecycle, or errors. Not for the default stable package (use sandbox-stable) or for porting stable to @next (use sandbox-migrate-to-next).
* sandbox-stableUse when building or changing Cloudflare Sandbox apps on the current stable @cloudflare/sandbox package (default npm tag)—commands, sessions, files, ports, tunnels, terminals, bridge, production, or deprecated-API cleanup while staying on stable. Not for @cloudflare/sandbox@next (use sandbox-next) or for porting to 1.0 (use sandbox-migrate-to-next).
* turnstile-spinSet up Cloudflare Turnstile end-to-end in a project. Scan the codebase, create the widget via the Cloudflare API, embed it where user requests need bot verification (form submissions, SPA actions, API endpoints, download links, comment or vote submissions, etc.), wire canonical server-side siteverify in the customer's existing backend, validate, and persist the skill. Load this when a user asks to add Turnstile, set up CAPTCHA, protect a form or endpoint from bots, or fix a Turnstile integration. Mirrors developers.cloudflare.com/turnstile/spin.
* web-perfAnalyzes web performance using Chrome DevTools MCP. Measures Core Web Vitals (LCP, INP, CLS) and supplementary metrics (FCP, TBT, Speed Index), identifies render-blocking resources, network dependency chains, layout shifts, caching issues, and accessibility gaps. Use when asked to audit, profile, debug, or optimize page load performance, Lighthouse scores, or site speed. Biases towards retrieval from current documentation over pre-trained knowledge.
* workers-best-practicesReviews and authors Cloudflare Workers code against production best practices. Load when writing new Workers, reviewing Worker code, configuring wrangler.jsonc, or checking for common Workers anti-patterns (streaming, floating promises, global state, secrets, bindings, observability). Biases towards retrieval from Cloudflare docs over pre-trained knowledge.
* wranglerCloudflare Workers CLI for deploying, developing, and managing Workers, KV, R2, D1, Vectorize, Hyperdrive, Workers AI, Containers, Queues, Workflows, Pipelines, and Secrets Store. Load before running wrangler commands to ensure correct syntax and best practices. Biases towards retrieval from Cloudflare docs over pre-trained knowledge.

MCP servers

Live access to the Cloudflare API, docs, and observability.

MCP servers provide typed tools to call into Cloudflare at runtime. There are two options: [Code Mode](https://blog.cloudflare.com/code-mode-mcp/) — a single server that covers the entire Cloudflare API (2,500+ endpoints in \~1,000 tokens) — or a set of focused, domain-specific servers hosted in the [cloudflare/mcp-server-cloudflare](https://github.com/cloudflare/mcp-server-cloudflare) repo. The full catalog is also in the [MCP servers for Cloudflare](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agents/model-context-protocol/cloudflare/servers-for-cloudflare/) docs.

Wrangler CLI

Local dev, deploys, and Workers-specific commands.

Use [Wrangler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/) for local development, deploys, and product-specific commands like `wrangler d1 migrations apply` or `wrangler tail`. The bundled **wrangler** Skill teaches the agent when to reach for it.

What’s next

The unified `cf` CLI is in technical preview — a next-generation CLI that covers every Cloudflare product with consistent verbs and ergonomic output for agents. Try it with `npx cf`. [Read the announcement →](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cf-cli-local-explorer/)

Agent-friendly docs

Token-efficient references optimized for agents.

Append `/index.md` to any Cloudflare docs URL for a clean markdown version. Every top-level product section also has its own `llms.txt` — a page index sized for a single context window. A few useful ones:

* [developers.cloudflare.com/llms.txt](https://developers.cloudflare.com/llms.txt) — directory of every Cloudflare product.
* [developers.cloudflare.com/workers/llms.txt](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/llms.txt)
* [developers.cloudflare.com/agents/llms.txt](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agents/llms.txt)
* [developers.cloudflare.com/r2/llms.txt](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/llms.txt)
* [developers.cloudflare.com/d1/llms.txt](https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/llms.txt)

For a full overview of how these docs are structured for agents, refer to the [Docs for Agents guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/docs-for-agents/).

## Example prompts

```txt
Add a D1 database to my Worker and create a users table with full CRUD endpoints.
```

```txt
Build an image upload and transformation service using R2 and Cloudflare Images.
```

```txt
Deploy a globally distributed REST API on Workers with automatic scaling and zero cold starts.
```

```txt
Set up GitHub Actions to deploy this Worker to staging and production on Cloudflare.
```

```txt
Connect my Worker to an existing Postgres database using Hyperdrive for connection pooling.
```

## Tips

* The Cloudflare API MCP server uses Code Mode — Copilot writes JavaScript against a typed API to reach any of 2,500+ endpoints in \~1,000 tokens.
* Use `@workspace` in Copilot Chat to give the agent full context of your Workers project before asking it to build or deploy.
* Commit a `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file with repository-wide conventions — Copilot loads it automatically on every interaction, complementing Skills which are loaded on demand.

## FAQ

Does Copilot support Cloudflare Skills?

Yes. GitHub Copilot added Agent Skills support for VS Code agent mode, the Copilot CLI, and the cloud agent. Run `npx skills add https://github.com/cloudflare/skills` to install them. Refer to the [About agent skills ↗](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/agents/about-agent-skills)guide for details on where Copilot looks for Skills.

Should I use Skills, the MCP server, Wrangler CLI, or all of them?

All three. Skills load Cloudflare expertise into every agent-mode session. The Cloudflare API MCP server handles platform operations (DNS, WAF, Zero Trust, R2 buckets). Wrangler runs local dev and deploys in the VS Code terminal. The bundled `wrangler` Skill teaches Copilot when to reach for which.

Do I still need .github/copilot-instructions.md?

It's complementary. Use custom instructions for simple repository-wide conventions that apply to almost every task (coding standards, preferred libraries). Use Skills for detailed, situational guidance Copilot should only load when relevant.

Can Copilot deploy to Cloudflare directly?

Yes, via Wrangler in the VS Code terminal, or via a GitHub Actions workflow that Copilot can generate for you.

## Troubleshooting

Skills do not load in Copilot

Skills only work in VS Code agent mode, the Copilot CLI, and the cloud agent — not with inline completion or plain chat. Switch Copilot Chat to agent mode. If Skills are still not discovered, refer to [About agent skills ↗](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/agents/about-agent-skills)for the paths Copilot checks.

MCP server not available in VS Code

Ensure you are using VS Code 1.99+ which supports MCP natively. Add the server configuration to `.vscode/mcp.json`.

Getting outdated information about Cloudflare products

Enable the [Cloudflare docs MCP server](https://github.com/cloudflare/mcp-server-cloudflare) so the agent can fetch current documentation at runtime. If you prefer not to use the MCP server, point the agent directly at [developers.cloudflare.com/llms.txt](https://developers.cloudflare.com/llms.txt) for a directory of every product, or `developers.cloudflare.com/<product>/llms.txt`for a product-specific index.
