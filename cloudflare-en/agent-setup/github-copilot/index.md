# GitHub Copilot + Cloudflare

Editor extension and CLI with agent mode, workspace context, and native PR integration. Made by GitHub.

TerminalCloudExtension

[Cloudflare Skills](https://github.com/cloudflare/skills)· [Cloudflare Code Mode API MCP](https://github.com/cloudflare/mcp)· [Cloudflare Domain Specific MCPs](https://github.com/cloudflare/mcp-server-cloudflare)· [GitHub Copilot Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot)

## Quick start

1. **Install GitHub Copilot**

   Install the GitHub Copilot extension in VS Code from the [Visual Studio Marketplace ↗︎](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot). For JetBrains IDEs, Visual Studio, or Xcode, see the [Install the Copilot extension ↗︎](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/set-up/install-copilot-extension) guide.
2. **Install Cloudflare Skills**

   ```bash
   npx skills add https://github.com/cloudflare/skills
   ```


3. **Configure Cloudflare MCP servers**

   For VS Code, add to `.vscode/mcp.json`. For Copilot CLI, add to `~/.copilot/mcp-config.json` for user-level configuration or `.mcp.json` or `.github/mcp.json` for project-level configuration. For domain-specific MCP servers, refer to [mcp-server-cloudflare ↗︎](https://github.com/cloudflare/mcp-server-cloudflare). For the full Cloudflare API MCP server (Code Mode), refer to [cloudflare/mcp ↗︎](https://github.com/cloudflare/mcp).

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "cloudflare": { "url": "https://mcp.cloudflare.com/mcp" },
       "cloudflare-docs": { "url": "https://docs.mcp.cloudflare.com/mcp" },
       "cloudflare-bindings": { "url": "https://bindings.mcp.cloudflare.com/mcp" },
       "cloudflare-builds": { "url": "https://builds.mcp.cloudflare.com/mcp" },
       "cloudflare-observability": { "url": "https://observability.mcp.cloudflare.com/mcp" }
     }
   }
   ```

   Note

   In Visual Studio Code, `.vscode/mcp.json` uses `servers` as the root key instead of `mcpServers`. For the Visual Studio Code setup, refer to the [Visual Studio Code guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/visual-studio-code/).
4. **Try a prompt**

   Open Copilot Chat (**Ctrl+Shift+I**), switch to agent mode, and try a prompt — for example:

   ```txt
   Add mTLS authentication and schema validation to protect my API endpoints.
   ```

<details>

<summary>Cloudflare Skills

</summary>

Persistent platform context that teaches the agent how Cloudflare works.

Skills are instructions the agent loads on demand. The <a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/skills">cloudflare/skills</a> bundle covers every layer of the platform — so the agent knows your conventions without you re-explaining them.

- agents-sdkBuild, debug, or review Cloudflare Agents SDK applications using the agents package.
- cloudflareDiscover and choose Cloudflare products for apps, APIs, AI agents, storage, networking, and security. Use for architecture and product selection, including when the user describes a need without naming a Cloudflare product; then find the relevant skill or documentation.
- cloudflare-email-serviceImplement or troubleshoot Cloudflare Email Sending and Email Routing integrations and their delivery configuration.
- cloudflare-oneDesign, configure, troubleshoot, or review Cloudflare One Zero Trust and SASE deployments. Use cloudflare-one-migrations for migration planning from other vendors.
- cloudflare-one-migrationsAssess and plan migrations from existing VPN, SWG, or SASE platforms to Cloudflare One, including policy mapping, parity gaps, and rollout.
- durable-objectsBuild, debug, or review Cloudflare Durable Objects code for persistent state and coordination.
- nextjs-on-cloudflareBuild, migrate, and deploy Next.js apps on Cloudflare Workers with vinext. Use when starting a Next.js project on Cloudflare, moving an existing app to Workers, choosing between vinext and OpenNext, or setting up vinext for Workers. For setup, migration, or deployment, install vinext's upstream skills with \`npx skills add cloudflare/vinext\` if missing, then read and follow the applicable skill and docs.
- sandbox-migrate-to-nextMigrate Cloudflare Sandbox apps from stable @cloudflare/sandbox to @cloudflare/sandbox@next (SDK 1.0 preview). Use sandbox-next for apps already on the preview.
- sandbox-nextBuild or maintain Cloudflare Sandbox apps on @cloudflare/sandbox@next (SDK 1.0 preview). Use sandbox-migrate-to-next when porting a stable app.
- sandbox-stableBuild or maintain Cloudflare Sandbox apps on the stable @cloudflare/sandbox package. Use sandbox-next for preview apps and sandbox-migrate-to-next for stable-to-preview migrations.
- turnstile-spinSet up, repair, or migrate to Cloudflare Turnstile bot verification in an existing frontend and backend, including server-side Siteverify.
- web-perfAudit, diagnose, or optimize website loading and interaction performance, Core Web Vitals, and Lighthouse performance scores.
- workers-best-practicesCloudflare Workers best practices for production applications. Use when writing, reviewing, or configuring Workers.
- wranglerRun or troubleshoot Wrangler CLI commands and configure Worker projects for local development, Previews, deployment, and Cloudflare resource management.

<summary>MCP servers

</summary>

Live access to the Cloudflare API, docs, and observability.

MCP servers provide typed tools to call into Cloudflare at runtime. There are two options: <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/code-mode-mcp/">Code Mode</a> — a single server that covers the entire Cloudflare API (2,500+ endpoints in \~1,000 tokens) — or a set of focused, domain-specific servers hosted in the <a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/mcp-server-cloudflare">cloudflare/mcp-server-cloudflare</a> repo. The full catalog is also in the <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/agents/model-context-protocol/cloudflare/servers-for-cloudflare/">MCP servers for Cloudflare</a> docs.

<summary>Wrangler CLI

</summary>

Local dev, deploys, and Workers-specific commands.

Use <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/">Wrangler</a> for local development, deploys, and product-specific commands like <code>wrangler d1 migrations apply</code> or <code>wrangler tail</code>. The bundled **wrangler** Skill teaches the agent when to reach for it.

What’s next

The unified <code>cf</code> CLI is in technical preview — a next-generation CLI that covers every Cloudflare product with consistent verbs and ergonomic output for agents. Try it with <code>npx cf</code>. <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cf-cli-local-explorer/">Read the announcement →</a>

</details>

<details>

<summary>Agent-friendly docs

</summary>

Token-efficient references optimized for agents.

Append <code>/index.md</code> to any Cloudflare docs URL for a clean markdown version. Every top-level product section also has its own <code>llms.txt</code> — a page index sized for a single context window. A few useful ones:

- <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/llms.txt">developers.cloudflare.com/llms.txt</a> — directory of every Cloudflare product.
- <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/llms.txt">developers.cloudflare.com/workers/llms.txt</a>
- <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/agents/llms.txt">developers.cloudflare.com/agents/llms.txt</a>
- <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/llms.txt">developers.cloudflare.com/r2/llms.txt</a>
- <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/llms.txt">developers.cloudflare.com/d1/llms.txt</a>

For a full overview of how these docs are structured for agents, refer to the <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/docs-for-agents/">Docs for Agents guide</a>.

## Example prompts

```txt
Add a D1 database to my Worker and create a users table with full CRUD endpoints.
```

```txt
Configure caching rules and cache TTLs to reduce origin load for my e-commerce store.
```

```txt
Check my Workers deployment logs for errors and suggest fixes.
```

```txt
Optimize my Worker to serve WebP images with responsive resizing using Cloudflare Images.
```

```txt
Build an AI chat agent using the Cloudflare Agents SDK with persistent conversation history stored in D1.
```

## Tips

- The Cloudflare API MCP server uses Code Mode — Copilot writes JavaScript against a typed API to reach any of 2,500+ endpoints in \~1,000 tokens.
- Use `@workspace` in Copilot Chat to give the agent full context of your Workers project before asking it to build or deploy.
- Commit a `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file with repository-wide conventions — Copilot loads it automatically on every interaction, complementing Skills which are loaded on demand.

## FAQ

<details>

<summary>Does Copilot support Cloudflare Skills?

</summary>

Yes. GitHub Copilot added Agent Skills support for VS Code agent mode, the Copilot CLI, and the cloud agent. Run <code>npx skills add https://github.com/cloudflare/skills</code> to install them. Refer to the <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/agents/about-agent-skills">About agent skills ↗︎</a> guide for details on where Copilot looks for Skills.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Should I use Skills, the MCP server, Wrangler CLI, or all of them?

</summary>

All three. Skills load Cloudflare expertise into every agent-mode session. The Cloudflare API MCP server handles platform operations (DNS, WAF, Zero Trust, R2 buckets). Wrangler runs local dev and deploys in the VS Code terminal. The bundled <code>wrangler</code> Skill teaches Copilot when to reach for which.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Do I still need .github/copilot-instructions.md?

</summary>

It's complementary. Use custom instructions for simple repository-wide conventions that apply to almost every task (coding standards, preferred libraries). Use Skills for detailed, situational guidance Copilot should only load when relevant.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Can Copilot deploy to Cloudflare directly?

</summary>

Yes, via Wrangler in the VS Code terminal, or via a GitHub Actions workflow that Copilot can generate for you.

</details>

## Troubleshooting

<details>

<summary>Skills do not load in Copilot

</summary>

Skills only work in VS Code agent mode, the Copilot CLI, and the cloud agent — not with inline completion or plain chat. Switch Copilot Chat to agent mode. If Skills are still not discovered, refer to <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/agents/about-agent-skills">About agent skills ↗︎</a> for the paths Copilot checks.

</details>

<details>

<summary>MCP server not available in VS Code

</summary>

Ensure you are using VS Code 1.99+ which supports MCP natively. Add the server configuration to <code>.vscode/mcp.json</code>.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Getting outdated information about Cloudflare products

</summary>

Enable the <a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/mcp-server-cloudflare">Cloudflare docs MCP server</a> so the agent can fetch current documentation at runtime. If you prefer not to use the MCP server, point the agent directly at <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/llms.txt">developers.cloudflare.com/llms.txt</a> for a directory of every product, or <code>developers.cloudflare.com/&lt;product&gt;/llms.txt</code> for a product-specific index.
