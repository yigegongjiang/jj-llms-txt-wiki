# Visual Studio Code + Cloudflare

Free, open-source code editor with native Model Context Protocol (MCP) client support and Copilot Chat integration. Made by Microsoft.

[Cloudflare Skills](https://github.com/cloudflare/skills)· [Cloudflare Code Mode API MCP](https://github.com/cloudflare/mcp)· [Cloudflare Domain Specific MCPs](https://github.com/cloudflare/mcp-server-cloudflare)· [Visual Studio Code Docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs)

## Quick start

1. **Install Visual Studio Code and GitHub Copilot**

   Install [Visual Studio Code ↗︎](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and make sure it is fully up to date. Then install the [GitHub Copilot extension ↗︎](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot) and sign in with a GitHub account. The Copilot free tier is enough to try this.
2. **Configure the Cloudflare MCP server**

   Create `.vscode/mcp.json` inside your workspace folder:

   ```json
   {
     "servers": {
       "cloudflare-api": {
         "type": "http",
         "url": "https://mcp.cloudflare.com/mcp"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   Visual Studio Code uses `servers` as the root key. Configurations copied from Cursor or Claude Desktop use `mcpServers` and will silently do nothing here. For domain-specific MCP servers, refer to [mcp-server-cloudflare ↗︎](https://github.com/cloudflare/mcp-server-cloudflare). For the full Cloudflare API MCP server (Code Mode), refer to [cloudflare/mcp ↗︎](https://github.com/cloudflare/mcp).
3. **Start the server and authorize**

   After you save `mcp.json`, Visual Studio Code shows a **Start** CodeLens on the `cloudflare-api` server definition. Select it and complete the OAuth flow to authorize the Cloudflare MCP server against your account. Start with a demo account until you are comfortable with the scope you grant.
4. **Try a prompt**

   Open Copilot Chat (**Ctrl+Shift+I** / **Cmd+Shift+I**), switch to agent mode, and try a prompt — for example:

   ```txt
   Create a RAG pipeline using Vectorize and Workers AI to answer questions over my documentation.
   ```

<summary>Cloudflare Skills

</summary>

Persistent platform context that teaches the agent how Cloudflare works.

Skills are instructions the agent loads on demand. The <a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/skills">cloudflare/skills</a> bundle covers every layer of the platform — so the agent knows your conventions without you re-explaining them.

- agents-sdkBuild, debug, or review Cloudflare Agents SDK applications using the agents package.
- cloudflareDiscover and choose Cloudflare products for apps, APIs, AI agents, storage, networking, and security. Use for architecture and product selection, including when the user describes a need without naming a Cloudflare product; then find the relevant skill or documentation.
- cloudflare-email-serviceImplement or troubleshoot Cloudflare Email Sending and Email Routing integrations and their delivery configuration.
- cloudflare-oneDesign, configure, troubleshoot, or review Cloudflare One Zero Trust and SASE deployments. Use cloudflare-one-migrations for migration planning from other vendors.
- cloudflare-one-migrationsAssess and plan migrations from existing VPN, SWG, or SASE platforms to Cloudflare One, including policy mapping, parity gaps, and rollout.
- durable-objectsBuild, debug, or review Cloudflare Durable Objects code for persistent state and coordination.
- nextjs-on-cloudflareBuild, migrate, and deploy Next.js apps on Cloudflare Workers with vinext. Use when starting a Next.js project on Cloudflare, moving an existing app to Workers, choosing between vinext and OpenNext, or setting up vinext for Workers. For setup, migration, or deployment, install vinext's upstream skills with \`npx skills add cloudflare/vinext\` if missing, then read and follow the applicable skill and docs.
- sandbox-migrate-to-nextMigrate Cloudflare Sandbox apps from stable @cloudflare/sandbox to @cloudflare/sandbox@next (SDK 1.0 preview). Use sandbox-next for apps already on the preview.
- sandbox-nextBuild or maintain Cloudflare Sandbox apps on @cloudflare/sandbox@next (SDK 1.0 preview). Use sandbox-migrate-to-next when porting a stable app.
- sandbox-stableBuild or maintain Cloudflare Sandbox apps on the stable @cloudflare/sandbox package. Use sandbox-next for preview apps and sandbox-migrate-to-next for stable-to-preview migrations.
- turnstile-spinSet up, repair, or migrate to Cloudflare Turnstile bot verification in an existing frontend and backend, including server-side Siteverify.
- web-perfAudit, diagnose, or optimize website loading and interaction performance, Core Web Vitals, and Lighthouse performance scores.
- workers-best-practicesCloudflare Workers best practices for production applications. Use when writing, reviewing, or configuring Workers.
- wranglerRun or troubleshoot Wrangler CLI commands and configure Worker projects for local development, Previews, deployment, and Cloudflare resource management.

<summary>MCP servers

</summary>

Live access to the Cloudflare API, docs, and observability.

MCP servers provide typed tools to call into Cloudflare at runtime. There are two options: <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/code-mode-mcp/">Code Mode</a> — a single server that covers the entire Cloudflare API (2,500+ endpoints in \~1,000 tokens) — or a set of focused, domain-specific servers hosted in the <a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/mcp-server-cloudflare">cloudflare/mcp-server-cloudflare</a> repo. The full catalog is also in the <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/agents/model-context-protocol/cloudflare/servers-for-cloudflare/">MCP servers for Cloudflare</a> docs.

<summary>Wrangler CLI

</summary>

Local dev, deploys, and Workers-specific commands.

Use <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/">Wrangler</a> for local development, deploys, and product-specific commands like <code>wrangler d1 migrations apply</code> or <code>wrangler tail</code>. The bundled **wrangler** Skill teaches the agent when to reach for it.

What’s next

The unified <code>cf</code> CLI is in technical preview — a next-generation CLI that covers every Cloudflare product with consistent verbs and ergonomic output for agents. Try it with <code>npx cf</code>. <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cf-cli-local-explorer/">Read the announcement →</a>

</details>

<details>

<summary>Agent-friendly docs

</summary>

Token-efficient references optimized for agents.

Append <code>/index.md</code> to any Cloudflare docs URL for a clean markdown version. Every top-level product section also has its own <code>llms.txt</code> — a page index sized for a single context window. A few useful ones:

- <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/llms.txt">developers.cloudflare.com/llms.txt</a> — directory of every Cloudflare product.
- <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/llms.txt">developers.cloudflare.com/workers/llms.txt</a>
- <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/agents/llms.txt">developers.cloudflare.com/agents/llms.txt</a>
- <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/llms.txt">developers.cloudflare.com/r2/llms.txt</a>
- <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/llms.txt">developers.cloudflare.com/d1/llms.txt</a>

## Example prompts

```txt
Deploy a full-stack React app to Cloudflare Pages with a Workers API backend and D1 database.
```

```txt
Build a serverless AI inference endpoint on Workers AI with streaming responses.
```

```txt

```

```txt
Configure Zero Trust access policies to protect my internal staging environment.
```

```txt
Check my Workers deployment logs for errors and suggest fixes.
```

## Tips

- The Cloudflare API MCP server uses Code Mode — the agent writes JavaScript against a typed API to reach any of 2,500+ endpoints in \~1,000 tokens. That is why you see only three tools registered, not thousands.
- Visual Studio Code's MCP configuration uses `servers` as the root key. Configurations copied from other agents (Cursor, Claude Desktop) use `mcpServers` and will not work in Visual Studio Code.
- Scope the OAuth grant to a single account, and start with **Read only** or a **Custom** permission set before granting **Full access**.
- Revoke the grant at any time from the Cloudflare dashboard under **My Profile → Access Management → Connected Applications**.

## FAQ

<details>

<summary>Why does the MCP server only show three tools?

</summary>

The Cloudflare API specification is roughly two million tokens, which is far too large to hand an agent directly. The Cloudflare MCP server uses a code-execution pattern: the agent gets a tool to search the API spec and a tool to execute calls, and the spec stays server-side. Three tools is the correct, healthy state.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Does this only work with Visual Studio Code?

</summary>

No. The same server URL (<code>https://mcp.cloudflare.com/mcp</code>) works in Claude Code, Cursor, Claude Desktop, or any MCP-capable client. Visual Studio Code is one option among many.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Can I use a Cloudflare API token instead of OAuth?

</summary>

Yes. You can pass a Cloudflare API token as a bearer credential, which makes sense for CI/CD or shared automation. For interactive editor use, OAuth is the recommended path. API tokens using Client IP Address Filtering are not supported.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Do I need GitHub Copilot to use MCP in Visual Studio Code?

</summary>

Copilot Chat is the MCP client used in this guide, so yes — you need Copilot (or another MCP-capable extension) to actually drive the server. Visual Studio Code itself provides the MCP configuration and lifecycle, but the chat UI comes from Copilot.

</details>

## Troubleshooting

<details>

<summary>Chat throws 'Cannot read properties of undefined'

</summary>

The Visual Studio Code build and the Copilot extension are out of sync. Update Visual Studio Code from the blue button in the title bar, let it restart, and try again.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Writes fail with API error 10000, but reads work

</summary>

The OAuth grant is read-only even though you intended to grant full access. This can happen if you authorize more than once — subsequent flows can silently come through with a reduced scope. Revoke the application under **My Profile → Access Management → Connected Applications** in the Cloudflare dashboard, sign out of the MCP session in Visual Studio Code (the account icon at the bottom of the activity bar), then start the server again.

</details>

<details>

<summary>No Start button appears in mcp.json

</summary>

Check the root key in the JSON. Visual Studio Code requires <code>servers</code>, not <code>mcpServers</code>. Also confirm the file is at <code>.vscode/mcp.json</code> inside the open folder, not at the folder root.

</details>

<details>

<summary>The agent suggests creating an API token to work around an error

</summary>

Decline. If authentication is broken, the fix is the OAuth grant, not pasting a bearer token into a chat window. Follow the API error 10000 troubleshooting steps to re-grant cleanly.

</details>

<details>

<summary>401 errors in the Visual Studio Code logs

</summary>

Expected behavior until you select **Allow in this Session** in the Copilot Chat authorization prompt.
