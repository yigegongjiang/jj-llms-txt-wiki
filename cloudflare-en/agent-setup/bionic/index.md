LM Studio

# Bionic + Cloudflare

Powerful agent for coding and work. Natively local, with open models in the cloud. By LM Studio.

StandaloneCloud

[Cloudflare Code Mode API MCP](https://github.com/cloudflare/mcp)· [Cloudflare Domain Specific MCPs](https://github.com/cloudflare/mcp-server-cloudflare)· [Bionic Docs](https://lmstudio.ai/docs/bionic)

## Quick start

1. **Install LM Studio Bionic**

   Download and install Bionic from the [LM Studio Bionic website ↗︎](https://lmstudio.ai/).
2. **Create a Code Project**

   In Bionic, create a **Code Project**, then select the local directory that contains your Cloudflare project. If your project has a `wrangler.jsonc` file, select the directory that contains it.
3. **Add the Cloudflare MCP server**

   In Bionic, add Cloudflare as a remote Model Context Protocol (MCP) server using the following URL:

   ```txt
   https://mcp.cloudflare.com/mcp
   ```


4. **Try a prompt**

   Ask Bionic to investigate a task, make changes, and run relevant tests. Review its diffs and command output before keeping changes.

   For example:

   ```txt
   Set up a Waiting Room to handle flash sale traffic spikes without dropping requests.
   ```

<details>

<summary>Cloudflare Skills

</summary>

Persistent platform context that teaches the agent how Cloudflare works.

Skills are instructions the agent loads on demand. The <a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/skills">cloudflare/skills</a> bundle covers every layer of the platform — so the agent knows your conventions without you re-explaining them.

- agents-sdkBuild, debug, or review Cloudflare Agents SDK applications using the agents package.
- cloudflareDiscover and choose Cloudflare products for apps, APIs, AI agents, storage, networking, and security. Use for architecture and product selection, including when the user describes a need without naming a Cloudflare product; then find the relevant skill or documentation.
- cloudflare-email-serviceImplement or troubleshoot Cloudflare Email Sending and Email Routing integrations and their delivery configuration.
- cloudflare-oneDesign, configure, troubleshoot, or review Cloudflare One Zero Trust and SASE deployments. Use cloudflare-one-migrations for migration planning from other vendors.
- cloudflare-one-migrationsAssess and plan migrations from existing VPN, SWG, or SASE platforms to Cloudflare One, including policy mapping, parity gaps, and rollout.
- durable-objectsBuild, debug, or review Cloudflare Durable Objects code for persistent state and coordination.
- nextjs-on-cloudflareBuild, migrate, and deploy Next.js apps on Cloudflare Workers with vinext. Use when starting a Next.js project on Cloudflare, moving an existing app to Workers, choosing between vinext and OpenNext, or setting up vinext for Workers. For setup, migration, or deployment, install vinext's upstream skills with \`npx skills add cloudflare/vinext\` if missing, then read and follow the applicable skill and docs.
- sandbox-migrate-to-nextMigrate Cloudflare Sandbox apps from stable @cloudflare/sandbox to @cloudflare/sandbox@next (SDK 1.0 preview). Use sandbox-next for apps already on the preview.
- sandbox-nextBuild or maintain Cloudflare Sandbox apps on @cloudflare/sandbox@next (SDK 1.0 preview). Use sandbox-migrate-to-next when porting a stable app.
- sandbox-stableBuild or maintain Cloudflare Sandbox apps on the stable @cloudflare/sandbox package. Use sandbox-next for preview apps and sandbox-migrate-to-next for stable-to-preview migrations.
- turnstile-spinSet up, repair, or migrate to Cloudflare Turnstile bot verification in an existing frontend and backend, including server-side Siteverify.
- web-perfAudit, diagnose, or optimize website loading and interaction performance, Core Web Vitals, and Lighthouse performance scores.
- workers-best-practicesCloudflare Workers best practices for production applications. Use when writing, reviewing, or configuring Workers.
- wranglerRun or troubleshoot Wrangler CLI commands and configure Worker projects for local development, Previews, deployment, and Cloudflare resource management.

<summary>MCP servers

</summary>

Live access to the Cloudflare API, docs, and observability.

MCP servers provide typed tools to call into Cloudflare at runtime. There are two options: <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/code-mode-mcp/">Code Mode</a> — a single server that covers the entire Cloudflare API (2,500+ endpoints in \~1,000 tokens) — or a set of focused, domain-specific servers hosted in the <a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/mcp-server-cloudflare">cloudflare/mcp-server-cloudflare</a> repo. The full catalog is also in the <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/agents/model-context-protocol/cloudflare/servers-for-cloudflare/">MCP servers for Cloudflare</a> docs.

<summary>Wrangler CLI

</summary>

Local dev, deploys, and Workers-specific commands.

Use <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/">Wrangler</a> for local development, deploys, and product-specific commands like <code>wrangler d1 migrations apply</code> or <code>wrangler tail</code>. The bundled **wrangler** Skill teaches the agent when to reach for it.

What’s next

The unified <code>cf</code> CLI is in technical preview — a next-generation CLI that covers every Cloudflare product with consistent verbs and ergonomic output for agents. Try it with <code>npx cf</code>. <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cf-cli-local-explorer/">Read the announcement →</a>

</details>

<details>

<summary>Agent-friendly docs

</summary>

Token-efficient references optimized for agents.

Append <code>/index.md</code> to any Cloudflare docs URL for a clean markdown version. Every top-level product section also has its own <code>llms.txt</code> — a page index sized for a single context window. A few useful ones:

- <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/llms.txt">developers.cloudflare.com/llms.txt</a> — directory of every Cloudflare product.
- <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/llms.txt">developers.cloudflare.com/workers/llms.txt</a>
- <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/agents/llms.txt">developers.cloudflare.com/agents/llms.txt</a>
- <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/llms.txt">developers.cloudflare.com/r2/llms.txt</a>
- <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/llms.txt">developers.cloudflare.com/d1/llms.txt</a>

## Tips

- Use a **Code Project** for local Cloudflare source files. Use a **Work Project** for research, writing, and document tasks.
- Use the Cloudflare API MCP server for account resources and domain-specific servers for focused workflows.
- Review Bionic diffs and command output before keeping changes.

## FAQ

<details>

<summary>Should I use the MCP server, Wrangler CLI, or both?

</summary>

Use both. The Cloudflare API MCP server handles Cloudflare account operations, such as DNS, WAF, R2, and Zero Trust. Wrangler handles local development, deployments, and migrations. In a Code Project, Bionic can run local shell commands, including Wrangler commands.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How do I give Bionic access to my Cloudflare account?

</summary>

Add <code><a href="https://mcp.cloudflare.com/mcp">https://mcp.cloudflare.com/mcp ↗︎</a></code> as a remote MCP server. When Bionic prompts you, complete the OAuth authorization flow in your browser and choose the permissions to grant.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Can Bionic deploy existing Workers projects?

</summary>

Yes. Create a Code Project from the existing project directory where <code>wrangler.jsonc</code> is located. You can then ask Bionic to run the deployment command for that project.

</details>

<details>

<summary>What does Code Mode mean for MCP?

</summary>

Code Mode is how the Cloudflare API MCP server fits all 2,500+ API endpoints into about 1,000 tokens. Instead of exposing every endpoint as a separate tool, it exposes <code>search()</code> and <code>execute()</code>. Bionic writes JavaScript to call them. For more information, refer to <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/code-mode-mcp/">Code Mode</a>.

</details>

## Troubleshooting

<details>

<summary>MCP server not connecting

</summary>

Confirm that the server URL is <code><a href="https://mcp.cloudflare.com/mcp">https://mcp.cloudflare.com/mcp ↗︎</a></code>. Remove and re-add the remote MCP server in Bionic, then try connecting again.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Getting outdated information about Cloudflare products

</summary>

Add the Cloudflare documentation MCP server at <code><a href="https://docs.mcp.cloudflare.com/mcp">https://docs.mcp.cloudflare.com/mcp ↗︎</a></code> so Bionic can retrieve current documentation. Alternatively, point Bionic to <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/llms.txt">developers.cloudflare.com/llms.txt</a> for a directory of all products, or <code>developers.cloudflare.com/&lt;product&gt;/llms.txt</code> for a product-specific index.

</details>

<details>

<summary>MCP server authentication fails

</summary>

Remove and re-add the MCP server. When Bionic prompts you, complete the OAuth authorization flow in your browser.
