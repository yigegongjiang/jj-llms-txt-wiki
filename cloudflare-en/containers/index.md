# Containers

Last updated Jun 8, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/containers/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Enhance your Workers with serverless containers

Available on Workers Paid plan

Run code written in any programming language, built for any runtime, as part of apps built on [Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers).

Deploy your container image to `Region:Earth` without worrying about managing infrastructure - just define your Worker and [wrangler deploy](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/commands/general/#deploy).

With Containers you can run:

* Resource-intensive applications that require CPU cores running in parallel, large amounts of memory or disk space
* Applications and libraries that require a full filesystem, specific runtime, or Linux-like environment
* Existing applications and tools that have been distributed as container images

Container instances are spun up on-demand and controlled by code you write in your [Worker](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers). Instead of chaining together API calls or writing Kubernetes operators, you just write JavaScript:

```js
import { Container, getContainer } from "@cloudflare/containers";

export class MyContainer extends Container {
	defaultPort = 4000; // Port the container is listening on
	sleepAfter = "10m"; // Stop the instance if requests not sent for 10 minutes
}

export default {
	async fetch(request, env) {
		const { "session-id": sessionId } = await request.json();
		// Get the container instance for the given session ID
		const containerInstance = getContainer(env.MY_CONTAINER, sessionId);
		// Pass the request to the container instance on its default port
		return containerInstance.fetch(request);
	},
};
```

```jsonc
{
	"name": "container-starter",
	"main": "src/index.js",
	// Set this to today's date
	"compatibility_date": "2026-07-28",
	"containers": [
		{
			"class_name": "MyContainer",
			"image": "./Dockerfile",
			"max_instances": 5
		}
	],
	"durable_objects": {
		"bindings": [
			{
				"class_name": "MyContainer",
				"name": "MY_CONTAINER"
			}
		]
	},
	"migrations": [
		{
			"new_sqlite_classes": ["MyContainer"],
			"tag": "v1"
		}
	]
}
```

```toml
name = "container-starter"
main = "src/index.js"
# Set this to today's date
compatibility_date = "2026-07-28"

[[containers]]
class_name = "MyContainer"
image = "./Dockerfile"
max_instances = 5

[[durable_objects.bindings]]
class_name = "MyContainer"
name = "MY_CONTAINER"

[[migrations]]
new_sqlite_classes = [ "MyContainer" ]
tag = "v1"
```

## Next Steps

[Deploy your first Container](https://developers.cloudflare.com/containers/get-started/)

Build and push an image, call a Container from a Worker, and understand scaling and routing.

Deploy a Container

[Container Examples](https://developers.cloudflare.com/containers/examples/)

See examples of how to use a Container with a Worker, including stateless and stateful routing, regional placement, Workflow and Queue integrations, AI-generated code execution, and short-lived workloads.
