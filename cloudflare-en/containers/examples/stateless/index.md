# Stateless Instances

Run multiple instances across Cloudflare's network

Last updated Aug 28, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/containers/examples/stateless/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

To simply proxy requests to one of multiple instances of a container, you can use the `getRandom` function:

```ts
import { Container, getRandom } from "@cloudflare/containers";

const INSTANCE_COUNT = 3;

class Backend extends Container {
	defaultPort = 8080;
	sleepAfter = "2h";
}

export default {
	async fetch(request: Request, env: Env): Promise<Response> {
		const containerInstance = await getRandom(env.BACKEND, INSTANCE_COUNT);
		return containerInstance.fetch(request);
	},
};
```

Note

This example uses `getRandom`, which randomly selects one of a fixed number of Container instances for each request.

In the future, we will provide improved latency-aware load balancing and autoscaling.

This will make scaling stateless instances simple and routing more efficient. See the [autoscaling documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/containers/configuration/scaling-and-routing) for more details.
