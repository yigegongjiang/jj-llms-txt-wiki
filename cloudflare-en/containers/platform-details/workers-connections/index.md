# Connect to Workers and Bindings

Last updated Apr 21, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/containers/platform-details/workers-connections/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Containers can access [Workers bindings](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/) — KV, R2, D1, Durable Objects, and others — through [outbound handlers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/containers/platform-details/outbound-traffic/#define-outbound-handlers). An outbound handler intercepts HTTP requests from the container and runs inside the Workers runtime, where all of your configured bindings are available.

The container makes a plain HTTP request to a virtual hostname (for example, `http://my.kv/some-key`), and the outbound handler resolves it using the bound resource. No SDK or client library is required inside the container.

## Use bindings in outbound handlers

Define an `outboundByHost` handler for each virtual hostname. The `env` argument gives you access to every binding declared in your Wrangler configuration.

```js
export class MyContainer extends Container {}

MyContainer.outboundByHost = {
	"my.kv": async (request, env, ctx) => {
		const url = new URL(request.url);
		const key = url.pathname.slice(1);
		const value = await env.KV.get(key);
		return new Response(value);
	},
	"my.r2": async (request, env, ctx) => {
		const url = new URL(request.url);
		// Scope access to this container's ID
		const path = `${ctx.containerId}${url.pathname}`;
		const object = await env.R2.get(path);
		return new Response(object?.body ?? null, { status: object ? 200 : 404 });
	},
};
```

The container calls `http://my.kv/some-key` and the handler resolves it using the KV binding. A call to `http://my.r2/file.png` reads from R2, scoped to the current container instance.

Note

You can use `ctx.containerId` to apply different rules per container instance — for example, to look up per-instance configuration from KV.

## Access Durable Object state

The `ctx` argument exposes `containerId`, which lets you interact with the container's own Durable Object from an outbound handler.

```js
"get-state.do": async (request, env, ctx) => {
  const id = env.MY_CONTAINER.idFromString(ctx.containerId);
  const stub = env.MY_CONTAINER.get(id);
  // Assumes getStateForKey is defined on your DO
  return stub.getStateForKey(request.body);
},
```
