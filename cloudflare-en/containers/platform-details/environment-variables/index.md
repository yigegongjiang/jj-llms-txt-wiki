# Environment Variables

Last updated Apr 21, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/containers/platform-details/environment-variables/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

## Runtime environment variables

The container runtime automatically sets the following variables:

* `CLOUDFLARE_APPLICATION_ID` \- the ID of the Containers application
* `CLOUDFLARE_COUNTRY_A2` \- the [ISO 3166-1 Alpha 2 code ↗](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#search/code/) of a country the container is placed in
* `CLOUDFLARE_LOCATION` \- a name of a location the container is placed in
* `CLOUDFLARE_REGION` \- a region name
* `CLOUDFLARE_DURABLE_OBJECT_ID` \- the ID of the Durable Object instance that the container is bound to. You can use this to identify particular container instances on the dashboard.

## User-defined environment variables

You can set environment variables when defining a Container in your Worker, or when starting a container instance.

For example:

```javascript
class MyContainer extends Container {
	defaultPort = 4000;
	envVars = {
		MY_CUSTOM_VAR: "value",
		ANOTHER_VAR: "another_value",
	};
}
```

More details about defining environment variables and secrets can be found in [this example](https://developers.cloudflare.com/containers/examples/env-vars-and-secrets).
