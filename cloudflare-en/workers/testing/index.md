# Testing

Last updated Jul 3, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/testing/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

The Workers platform has a variety of ways to test your applications, depending on your requirements. We recommend using the [Vitest integration](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/testing/vitest-integration), which allows you to run tests _inside_ the Workers runtime, and unit test individual functions within your Worker.

[Get started with Vitest](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/testing/vitest-integration/write-your-first-test/) 

## Testing comparison matrix

However, if you don't use Vitest, both [Miniflare's API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/testing/miniflare/writing-tests) and the [unstable\_startWorker()](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/api/#unstable%5Fstartworker) API provide options for testing your Worker in any testing framework.
