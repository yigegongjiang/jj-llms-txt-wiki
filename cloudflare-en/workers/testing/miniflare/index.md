# Miniflare

Last updated Jul 27, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/testing/miniflare/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Caution

This documentation describes the Miniflare API, which is only relevant for advanced use cases. Instead, most users should use [Wrangler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler) to build, run & deploy their Workers locally

**Miniflare** is a simulator for developing and testing [**Cloudflare Workers** ↗](https://workers.cloudflare.com/). It's written in TypeScript, and runs your code in a sandbox implementing Workers' runtime APIs.

* 🎉 **Fun:** develop Workers easily with detailed logging, file watching and pretty error pages supporting source maps.
* 🔋 **Full-featured:** supports most Workers features, including KV, Durable Objects, WebSockets, modules and more.
* ⚡ **Fully-local:** test and develop Workers without an Internet connection. Reload code on change quickly.
[Get Started](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/testing/miniflare/get-started) [GitHub](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/tree/main/packages/miniflare) [NPM](https://npmjs.com/package/miniflare)

These docs primarily cover Miniflare specific things. For more information on runtime APIs, refer to the [Cloudflare Workers docs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers).

If you find something that doesn't behave as it does in the production Workers environment (and this difference isn't documented), or something's wrong in these docs, please [open a GitHub issue ↗](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/issues/new/choose).
