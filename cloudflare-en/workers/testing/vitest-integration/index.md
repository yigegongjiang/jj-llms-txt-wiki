# Vitest integration

Last updated Aug 20, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/testing/vitest-integration/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

For most users, Cloudflare recommends using the Workers Vitest integration for unit testing Workers and [Pages Functions](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/functions/) projects. [Vitest ↗](https://vitest.dev/) is a popular JavaScript testing framework featuring a fast watch mode, Jest compatibility, and default TypeScript support. Cloudflare provides the `@cloudflare/vitest-plugin` Vite plugin, which runs your Vitest tests inside the Workers runtime.

The Workers Vitest integration:

* Supports both **unit tests** and **integration tests**.
* Provides direct access to Workers runtime APIs and bindings.
* Implements isolated per-test-file storage.
* Runs tests fully-locally using [Miniflare ↗](https://miniflare.dev/).
* Leverages Vitest's hot-module reloading for near instant reruns.
* Supports projects with multiple Workers.
