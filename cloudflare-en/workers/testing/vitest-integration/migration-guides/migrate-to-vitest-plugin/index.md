# Migrate to Vitest plugin

Last updated Aug 20, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/testing/vitest-integration/migration-guides/migrate-to-vitest-plugin/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

`@cloudflare/vitest-plugin` replaces `@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers`. The package API and Vitest configuration are unchanged.

## Run the codemod

To update your project automatically, run the following command from the project root:

npmyarnpnpm

```
npx @cloudflare/codemods vitest:pool-workers-to-vitest-plugin
```

```
yarn @cloudflare/codemods vitest:pool-workers-to-vitest-plugin
```

```
pnpm @cloudflare/codemods vitest:pool-workers-to-vitest-plugin
```

Use `--dry-run` to preview the changes. Use `--files <glob>` to limit the files the codemod updates.

The codemod updates your dependency, imports, and test TypeScript configuration.

## Update manually

If you cannot run the codemod, update the package name in your `package.json`, imports, and test `tsconfig.json`:

```diff
- "@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers": "^0.16.0"
+ "@cloudflare/vitest-plugin": "^1.0.0"

- import { cloudflareTest } from "@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers";
+ import { cloudflareTest } from "@cloudflare/vitest-plugin";

- "types": ["@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers/types"]
+ "types": ["@cloudflare/vitest-plugin/types"]
```

The same rename applies to subpath imports, including `@cloudflare/vitest-plugin/config`.

## Update request mocking

To mock outbound requests, use [@msw/cloudflare ↗](https://github.com/mswjs/cloudflare). For setup instructions, refer to [Mock outbound requests](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/testing/vitest-integration/mock-outbound-requests/).
