[![Deploy to Cloudflare](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/cloudflare/docs-examples/tree/main/workers/extract-cookie-value)

This creates a repository in your GitHub account and deploys the application to Cloudflare Workers.

```js
import { parse } from "cookie";
export default {
	async fetch(request) {
		// The name of the cookie
		const COOKIE_NAME = "__uid";
		const cookie = parse(request.headers.get("Cookie") || "");
		if (cookie[COOKIE_NAME] != null) {
			// Respond with the cookie value
			return new Response(cookie[COOKIE_NAME]);
		}
		return new Response("No cookie with name: " + COOKIE_NAME);
	},
};
```

```ts
import { parse } from "cookie";
export default {
	async fetch(request): Promise<Response> {
		// The name of the cookie
		const COOKIE_NAME = "__uid";
		const cookie = parse(request.headers.get("Cookie") || "");
		if (cookie[COOKIE_NAME] != null) {
			// Respond with the cookie value
			return new Response(cookie[COOKIE_NAME]);
		}
		return new Response("No cookie with name: " + COOKIE_NAME);
	},
} satisfies ExportedHandler;
```

```py
from http.cookies import SimpleCookie
from workers import WorkerEntrypoint, Response

class Default(WorkerEntrypoint):
    async def fetch(self, request):
        # Name of the cookie
        cookie_name = "__uid"

        cookies = SimpleCookie(request.headers["Cookie"] or "")

        if cookie_name in cookies:
            # Respond with cookie value
            return Response(cookies[cookie_name].value)

        return Response("No cookie with name: " + cookie_name)
```

```ts
import { Hono } from 'hono';
import { getCookie } from 'hono/cookie';

const app = new Hono();

app.get('*', (c) => {
  // The name of the cookie
  const COOKIE_NAME = "__uid";

  // Get the specific cookie value using Hono's cookie helper
  const cookieValue = getCookie(c, COOKIE_NAME);

  if (cookieValue) {
    // Respond with the cookie value
    return c.text(cookieValue);
  }

  return c.text("No cookie with name: " + COOKIE_NAME);
});

export default app;
```

External dependencies

This example requires the npm package [cookie ↗](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cookie) to be installed in your JavaScript project.

The Hono example uses the built-in cookie utilities provided by Hono, so no external dependencies are needed for that implementation.
