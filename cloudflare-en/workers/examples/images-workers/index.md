[![Deploy to Cloudflare](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/cloudflare/docs-examples/tree/main/workers/images-workers)

This creates a repository in your GitHub account and deploys the application to Cloudflare Workers.

To serve images from a custom domain:

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Workers & Pages** page.  
[Go to **Workers & Pages** ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/workers-and-pages)
2. Select **Create application** \> **Workers** \> **Create Worker** and create your Worker.
3. In your Worker, select **Quick edit** and paste the following code.

```js
export default {
	async fetch(request) {
		// You can find this in the dashboard, it should look something like this: ZWd9g1K7eljCn_KDTu_MWA
		const accountHash = "";

		const { pathname } = new URL(request.url);

		// A request to something like cdn.example.com/83eb7b2-5392-4565-b69e-aff66acddd00/public
		// will fetch "https://imagedelivery.net/<accountHash>/83eb7b2-5392-4565-b69e-aff66acddd00/public"

		return fetch(`https://imagedelivery.net/${accountHash}${pathname}`);
	},
};
```

```ts
export default {
	async fetch(request): Promise<Response> {
		// You can find this in the dashboard, it should look something like this: ZWd9g1K7eljCn_KDTu_MWA
		const accountHash = "";

		const { pathname } = new URL(request.url);

		// A request to something like cdn.example.com/83eb7b2-5392-4565-b69e-aff66acddd00/public
		// will fetch "https://imagedelivery.net/<accountHash>/83eb7b2-5392-4565-b69e-aff66acddd00/public"

		return fetch(`https://imagedelivery.net/${accountHash}${pathname}`);
	},
} satisfies ExportedHandler;
```

```ts
import { Hono } from 'hono';

interface Env {
  // You can store your account hash as a binding variable
  ACCOUNT_HASH?: string;
}

const app = new Hono<{ Bindings: Env }>();

app.get('*', async (c) => {
  // You can find this in the dashboard, it should look something like this: ZWd9g1K7eljCn_KDTu_MWA
  // Either get it from environment or hardcode it here
  const accountHash = c.env.ACCOUNT_HASH || "";

  const url = new URL(c.req.url);

  // A request to something like cdn.example.com/83eb7b2-5392-4565-b69e-aff66acddd00/public
  // will fetch "https://imagedelivery.net/<accountHash>/83eb7b2-5392-4565-b69e-aff66acddd00/public"

  return fetch(`https://imagedelivery.net/${accountHash}${url.pathname}`);
});

export default app;
```

```py
from workers import WorkerEntrypoint
from js import URL, fetch

class Default(WorkerEntrypoint):
    async def fetch(self, request):
        # You can find this in the dashboard, it should look something like this: ZWd9g1K7eljCn_KDTu_MWA
        account_hash = ""
        url = URL.new(request.url)

        # A request to something like cdn.example.com/83eb7b2-5392-4565-b69e-aff66acddd00/public
        # will fetch "https://imagedelivery.net/<accountHash>/83eb7b2-5392-4565-b69e-aff66acddd00/public"
        return fetch(f'https://imagedelivery.net/{account_hash}{url.pathname}')
```

Another way you can serve images from a custom domain is by using the `cdn-cgi/imagedelivery` prefix path which is used as path to trigger `cdn-cgi` image proxy.

Below is an example showing the hostname as a Cloudflare proxied domain under the same account as the Image, followed with the prefix path and the image `<ACCOUNT_HASH>`, `<IMAGE_ID>` and `<VARIANT_NAME>` which can be found in the **Images** on the Cloudflare dashboard.

```js
https://example.com/cdn-cgi/imagedelivery/<ACCOUNT_HASH>/<IMAGE_ID>/<VARIANT_NAME>
```
