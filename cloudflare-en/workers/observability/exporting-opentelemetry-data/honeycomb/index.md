# Export to Honeycomb

Last updated Apr 23, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/observability/exporting-opentelemetry-data/honeycomb/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Honeycomb is an observability platform built for high-cardinality data that helps you understand and debug your applications. By exporting your Cloudflare Workers application telemetry to Honeycomb, you can:

* Visualize traces to understand request flows and identify performance bottlenecks
* Query and analyze logs with unlimited dimensionality across any attribute
* Create custom queries and dashboards to monitor your Workers

This guide will walk you through configuring your Cloudflare Worker application to export OpenTelemetry-compliant traces and logs to Honeycomb.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

* An active [Honeycomb account ↗](https://ui.honeycomb.io/signup) (free tier available)
* A deployed Worker that you want to monitor

## Step 1: Get your Honeycomb API key

1. Log in to your [Honeycomb account ↗](https://ui.honeycomb.io/)
2. Navigate to your account settings by clicking on your profile icon in the top right
3. Select **Team Settings**
4. In the left sidebar, click **Environments** and click the gear icon
5. Find your environment (e.g., `production`, `test`) or create a new one
6. Under **API Keys**, click **Create Ingest API Key**
7. Configure your API key:  
  * **Name**: Enter a descriptive name (e.g., `cloudflare-workers-otel`)
  * **Permissions**: Select **Can create services/datasets** (required for OTLP ingestion)
8. Click **Create**
9. **Important**: Copy the API key immediately and store it securely - you won't be able to see it again

The API key will look something like: `hcaik_01hq...`

## Step 2: Configure Cloudflare destinations

Now you'll create destinations in the Cloudflare dashboard that point to Honeycomb.

### Honeycomb OTLP endpoints

Honeycomb provides separate OTLP endpoints for traces and logs:

* **Traces**: `https://api.honeycomb.io/v1/traces`
* **Logs**: `https://api.honeycomb.io/v1/logs`

### Configure trace destination

1. Navigate to your Cloudflare account's [Workers Observability ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/workers-and-pages/observability/pipelines) section
2. Click **Add destination**
3. Configure your trace destination:  
  * **Destination Name**: `honeycomb-traces` (or any descriptive name)
  * **Destination Type**: Select **Traces**
  * **OTLP Endpoint**: `https://api.honeycomb.io/v1/traces`
  * **Custom Headers**: Add the authentication header:  
    * Header name: `x-honeycomb-team`
    * Header value: Your Honeycomb API key (e.g., `hcaik_01hq...`)
4. Click **Save**

### Configure logs destination

Repeat the process for logs:

1. Click **Add destination** again
2. Configure your logs destination:  
  * **Destination Name**: `honeycomb-logs` (or any descriptive name)
  * **Destination Type**: Select **Logs**
  * **OTLP Endpoint**: `https://api.honeycomb.io/v1/logs`
  * **Custom Headers**: Add the authentication header:  
    * Header name: `x-honeycomb-team`
    * Header value: Your Honeycomb API key (same as above)
3. Click **Save**

## Step 3: Configure your Worker

With your destinations created in the Cloudflare dashboard, update your Worker's configuration to enable telemetry export.

```jsonc
{
  "observability": {
    "traces": {
      "enabled": true,
      // Must match the destination name in the dashboard
      "destinations": ["honeycomb-traces"]
    },
    "logs": {
      "enabled": true,
      // Must match the destination name in the dashboard
      "destinations": ["honeycomb-logs"]
    }
  }
}
```

```toml
[observability.traces]
enabled = true
destinations = [ "honeycomb-traces" ]

[observability.logs]
enabled = true
destinations = [ "honeycomb-logs" ]
```

After updating your configuration, deploy your Worker for the changes to take effect.

Note

It may take a few minutes after deployment for data to appear in Honeycomb.
