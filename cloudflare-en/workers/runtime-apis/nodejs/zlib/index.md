Note

For compatibility dates of `2026-08-04` or later, Workers enables both `nodejs_compat` and `nodejs_compat_v2` by default. These flags are not used for these compatibility dates. Existing projects do not need to remove them when updating their compatibility date. For earlier dates, add `nodejs_compat` to your [Wrangler configuration file](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/) to opt in. For instructions to turn off Node.js compatibility, refer to the [Node.js compatibility flag](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/compatibility-flags/#nodejs-compatibility-flag).

The node:zlib module provides compression functionality implemented using Gzip, Deflate/Inflate, and Brotli. To access it:

```js
import zlib from "node:zlib";
```

The full `node:zlib` API is documented in the [Node.js documentation for node:zlib ↗](https://nodejs.org/api/zlib.html).
