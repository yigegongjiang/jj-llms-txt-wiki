Note

For compatibility dates of `2026-08-04` or later, Workers enables both `nodejs_compat` and `nodejs_compat_v2` by default. These flags are not used for these compatibility dates. Existing projects do not need to remove them when updating their compatibility date. For earlier dates, add `nodejs_compat` to your [Wrangler configuration file](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/) to opt in. For instructions to turn off Node.js compatibility, refer to the [Node.js compatibility flag](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/compatibility-flags/#nodejs-compatibility-flag).

The [node:crypto ↗](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/crypto.html) module provides cryptographic functionality that includes a set of wrappers for OpenSSL's hash, HMAC, cipher, decipher, sign, and verify functions.

All `node:crypto` APIs are fully supported in Workers with the following exceptions:

* The functions [generateKeyPair ↗](https://nodejs.org/api/crypto.html#cryptogeneratekeypairtype-options-callback) and [generateKeyPairSync ↗](https://nodejs.org/api/crypto.html#cryptogeneratekeypairsynctype-options)do not support DSA or DH key pairs.
* `argon2` and `argon2Sync` are not supported.
* `ed448` and `x448` curves are not supported.
* It is not possible to manually enable or disable [FIPS mode ↗](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/crypto.html#fips-mode).

The full `node:crypto` API is documented in the [Node.js documentation for node:crypto ↗](https://nodejs.org/api/crypto.html).

The [WebCrypto API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/web-crypto/) is also available within Cloudflare Workers. This does not require the `nodejs_compat` compatibility flag.
