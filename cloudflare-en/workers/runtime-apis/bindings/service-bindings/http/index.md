Worker A that declares a Service binding to Worker B can forward a [Request](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/request/) object to Worker B, by calling the `fetch()` method that is exposed on the binding object.

For example, consider the following Worker that implements a [fetch() handler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/handlers/fetch/):

```jsonc
{
	"$schema": "./node_modules/wrangler/config-schema.json",
	"name": "worker_b",
	"main": "./src/workerB.js"
}
```

```toml
"$schema" = "./node_modules/wrangler/config-schema.json"
name = "worker_b"
main = "./src/workerB.js"
```

```js
export default {
  async fetch(request, env, ctx) {
    return new Response("Hello World!");
  }
}
```

The following Worker declares a binding to the Worker above:

```jsonc
{
	"$schema": "./node_modules/wrangler/config-schema.json",
	"name": "worker_a",
	"main": "./src/workerA.js",
	"services": [
		{
			"binding": "WORKER_B",
			"service": "worker_b"
		}
	]
}
```

```toml
"$schema" = "./node_modules/wrangler/config-schema.json"
name = "worker_a"
main = "./src/workerA.js"

[[services]]
binding = "WORKER_B"
service = "worker_b"
```

And then can forward a request to it:

```js
export default {
	async fetch(request, env) {
		return await env.WORKER_B.fetch(request);
	},
};
```

Note

If you construct a new request manually, rather than forwarding an existing one, ensure that you provide a valid and fully-qualified URL with a hostname. For example:

```js
export default {
  async fetch(request, env) {
    // provide a valid URL
    let newRequest = new Request("https://valid-url.com", { method: "GET" });
    let response = await env.WORKER_B.fetch(newRequest);
    return response;
  }
};
```
