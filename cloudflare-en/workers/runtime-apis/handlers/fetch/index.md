# Fetch Handler

Last updated Apr 23, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/handlers/fetch/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

## Background

Incoming HTTP requests to a Worker are passed to the `fetch()` handler as a [Request](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/request/) object. To respond to the request with a response, return a [Response](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/response/) object:

```js
export default {
	async fetch(request, env, ctx) {
		return new Response('Hello World!');
	},
};
```

Note

The Workers runtime does not support `XMLHttpRequest` (XHR). Learn the difference between `XMLHttpRequest` and `fetch()` in the [MDN ↗](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest) documentation.

### Parameters

* `request` Request

  * The incoming HTTP request.
* `env` object

  * The [bindings](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/) available to the Worker. As long as the [environment](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/environments/) has not changed, the same object (equal by identity) may be passed to multiple requests. You can also [import env from cloudflare:workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/#importing-env-as-a-global) to access bindings from anywhere in your code.
* `ctx.waitUntil(promisePromise)` : void

  * Refer to [waitUntil](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/context/#waituntil).
* `ctx.passThroughOnException()` : void

  * Refer to [passThroughOnException](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/context/#passthroughonexception).
