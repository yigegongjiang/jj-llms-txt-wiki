# Next.js

Last updated Aug 25, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/framework-guides/web-apps/nextjs/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Use vinext to create or migrate a Next.js application and deploy it to Cloudflare Workers.

Cloudflare recommends [vinext ↗](https://vinext.dev/) as the default way to run Next.js applications on Cloudflare Workers. vinext gives you two starting points: scaffold a new Workers-ready app with `create-vinext-app`, or add vinext to an existing Next.js 16 app with a single non-destructive `vinext init` (your existing `next dev` keeps working). You do not need a Cloudflare-specific template either way.

Already on OpenNext? See [other Next.js deployment paths](#use-another-nextjs-deployment-path).

## What is Next.js?

[Next.js ↗](https://nextjs.org/) is a [React ↗](https://react.dev/) framework for building full-stack applications.

Next.js supports server-side rendering, client-side rendering, static generation, React Server Components, Server Actions, route handlers, and middleware.

## What is vinext?

[vinext ↗](https://github.com/cloudflare/vinext) is a Vite plugin that reimplements the Next.js API surface. You can keep your existing `app/`, `pages/`, `next.config.js`, and `public/` directories while using the Vite toolchain.

vinext is in beta. Before adopting it for an existing production application, run the compatibility check from your project directory and review the [vinext compatibility dashboard ↗](https://vinext.dev/compatibility).

## Choose a setup path

Most Next.js projects can start from the same workflow: open a Next.js app, check compatibility, add vinext, then deploy to Workers.

* Use [Add vinext with an agent](#add-vinext-with-an-agent) if you want an agent to inspect the project and apply the migration.
* Use [Add vinext with the CLI](#add-vinext-with-the-cli) if you want a direct, repeatable command-line setup.
* Use [Create a Cloudflare-ready project](#create-a-cloudflare-ready-project) if you want to scaffold a new project already configured for Workers.

## Add vinext with an agent

Use the vinext Agent Skill when you want a coding agent to inspect your Next.js project, run compatibility checks, update configuration, and start the vinext development server.

1. **Open your Next.js project.**  
Use an existing project, or create a project with your preferred Next.js setup flow.
2. **Install the vinext Agent Skill.**  
npmyarnpnpm  
```  
npx skills add cloudflare/vinext  
```  
```  
yarn dlx skills add cloudflare/vinext  
```  
```  
pnpx skills add cloudflare/vinext  
```
3. **Prompt your agent.**  
In your coding agent, run the following prompt:  
```txt  
migrate this project to vinext  
```  
The skill runs vinext compatibility checks, applies the migration, and flags issues that need manual attention.
4. **Develop with vinext.**  
Start the vinext development server.  
npmyarnpnpm  
```  
npm run dev:vinext  
```  
```  
yarn run dev:vinext  
```  
```  
pnpm run dev:vinext  
```
5. **Build with vinext.**  
Build the production output with vinext.  
npmyarnpnpm  
```  
npm run build:vinext  
```  
```  
yarn run build:vinext  
```  
```  
pnpm run build:vinext  
```
6. **Deploy to Workers.**  
Deploy with the vinext Cloudflare deploy command.  
npmyarnpnpm  
```  
npx @vinext/cloudflare deploy  
```  
```  
yarn dlx @vinext/cloudflare deploy  
```  
```  
pnpx @vinext/cloudflare deploy  
```

## Add vinext with the CLI

Use `vinext init` when you want a direct command-line setup. The migration is non-destructive: your existing Next.js setup continues to work alongside vinext while you test the Cloudflare Workers deployment.

1. **Open your Next.js project.**  
Use an existing project, or create a project with your preferred Next.js setup flow.
2. **Check compatibility.**  
Run the vinext compatibility check from your Next.js project directory.  
npmyarnpnpm  
```  
npx vinext check  
```  
```  
yarn dlx vinext check  
```  
```  
pnpx vinext check  
```  
Review any reported compatibility issues before continuing.
3. **Initialize vinext.**  
Run the vinext initializer and choose Cloudflare Workers as the deployment target when prompted.  
npmyarnpnpm  
```  
npx vinext init  
```  
```  
yarn dlx vinext init  
```  
```  
pnpx vinext init  
```  
`vinext init` installs vinext and Vite dependencies, adds vinext scripts, generates the Vite configuration, and creates the Cloudflare Workers configuration.
4. **Develop with vinext.**  
Start the vinext development server.  
npmyarnpnpm  
```  
npm run dev:vinext  
```  
```  
yarn run dev:vinext  
```  
```  
pnpm run dev:vinext  
```
5. **Build with vinext.**  
Build the production output with vinext.  
npmyarnpnpm  
```  
npm run build:vinext  
```  
```  
yarn run build:vinext  
```  
```  
pnpm run build:vinext  
```
6. **Deploy to Workers.**  
Deploy with the vinext Cloudflare deploy command.  
npmyarnpnpm  
```  
npx @vinext/cloudflare deploy  
```  
```  
yarn dlx @vinext/cloudflare deploy  
```  
```  
pnpx @vinext/cloudflare deploy  
```

## Create a Cloudflare-ready project

Use the create-cloudflare CLI (C3) when you want to scaffold a new Next.js project already configured for Cloudflare Workers.

1. **Create a new project with C3.**  
npmyarnpnpm  
```  
npm create cloudflare@latest -- my-next-app --framework=next  
```  
```  
yarn create cloudflare my-next-app --framework=next  
```  
```  
pnpm create cloudflare@latest my-next-app --framework=next  
```  
Command behavior  
C3 creates a new Next.js project, configures vinext for Cloudflare Workers, installs the required dependencies, and offers to deploy the application.
2. **Develop with vinext.**  
Change to your project directory and start the local development server.  
npmyarnpnpm  
```  
npm run dev  
```  
```  
yarn run dev  
```  
```  
pnpm run dev  
```
3. **Build your application.**  
Run the generated build script before deploying or testing a production build.  
npmyarnpnpm  
```  
npm run build  
```  
```  
yarn run build  
```  
```  
pnpm run build  
```
4. **Deploy your project.**  
Deploy your project to a [\*.workers.dev subdomain](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/routing/workers-dev/) or a [custom domain](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/routing/custom-domains/).  
npmyarnpnpm  
```  
npm run deploy  
```  
```  
yarn run deploy  
```  
```  
pnpm run deploy  
```

## Access Cloudflare bindings

In vinext applications deployed to Workers, use `cloudflare:workers` to access bindings from server components, route handlers, and server actions. Define bindings in your Wrangler configuration, then generate types with [wrangler types](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/commands/workers/#types).

For example, you can import `env` from `cloudflare:workers` in server-side application code to access D1, R2, KV, Durable Objects, Workers AI, Queues, Vectorize, and other bindings.

## Use another Next.js deployment path

vinext is the recommended path for Next.js applications on Cloudflare Workers, but other deployment paths remain documented:

| Path                                                                                                                    | Use when                                                                                                        |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [OpenNext adapter](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/framework-guides/web-apps/opennext/)                       | You maintain an existing OpenNext application that cannot yet migrate to vinext because of a compatibility gap. |
| [Static Next.js on Pages](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/framework-guides/nextjs/deploy-a-static-nextjs-site/) | Your application is a static export and you specifically want to deploy it to Cloudflare Pages.                 |
