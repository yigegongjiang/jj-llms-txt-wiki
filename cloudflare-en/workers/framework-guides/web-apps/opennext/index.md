# OpenNext adapter

Last updated Aug 25, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/framework-guides/web-apps/opennext/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Recommended path

Cloudflare recommends [vinext](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/framework-guides/web-apps/nextjs/) instead of OpenNext for new Next.js applications on Cloudflare Workers.

Use this guide to maintain an existing OpenNext application. Migrate to vinext when compatibility allows.

[OpenNext ↗](https://opennext.js.org/) adapts the output of `next build` so it can run on different platforms, including Cloudflare Workers.

## Supported features

## Configure OpenNext manually

Wrangler automatic configuration uses vinext for Next.js projects. To use OpenNext, configure the adapter manually.

1. **Install the OpenNext Cloudflare adapter.**  
npmyarnpnpmbun  
```  
npm i @opennextjs/cloudflare@latest  
```  
```  
yarn add @opennextjs/cloudflare@latest  
```  
```  
pnpm add @opennextjs/cloudflare@latest  
```  
```  
bun add @opennextjs/cloudflare@latest  
```
2. **Install Wrangler.**  
npmyarnpnpmbun  
```  
npm i -D wrangler@latest  
```  
```  
yarn add -D wrangler@latest  
```  
```  
pnpm add -D wrangler@latest  
```  
```  
bun add -d wrangler@latest  
```
3. **Add a Wrangler configuration file.**  
In your project root, create a [Wrangler configuration file](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/) with the following content:  
```jsonc  
{  
  "$schema": "./node_modules/wrangler/config-schema.json",  
  "name": "my-app",  
  "main": ".open-next/worker.js",  
  // Set this to today's date  
  "compatibility_date": "2026-08-25",  
  "compatibility_flags": [  
    "nodejs_compat"  
  ],  
  "assets": {  
    "directory": ".open-next/assets",  
    "binding": "ASSETS"  
  },  
  "observability": {  
    "enabled": true  
  }  
}  
```  
```toml  
name = "my-app"  
main = ".open-next/worker.js"  
# Set this to today's date  
compatibility_date = "2026-08-25"  
compatibility_flags = ["nodejs_compat"]  
[assets]  
directory = ".open-next/assets"  
binding = "ASSETS"  
[observability]  
enabled = true  
```  
Note  
You must turn on the [nodejs\_compat compatibility flag](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/nodejs/) and set your [compatibility date](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/compatibility-dates/) to `2024-09-23` or later.
4. **Add an OpenNext configuration file.**  
In your project root, create `open-next.config.ts`:  
```ts  
import { defineCloudflareConfig } from "@opennextjs/cloudflare";  
export default defineCloudflareConfig();  
```  
Use this file to configure OpenNext features such as caching. For more information, refer to [OpenNext caching ↗](https://opennext.js.org/cloudflare/caching).
5. **Update `package.json`.**  
Add scripts for previewing, deploying, and generating Cloudflare types:  
```json  
{  
  "scripts": {  
    "preview": "opennextjs-cloudflare build && opennextjs-cloudflare preview",  
    "deploy": "opennextjs-cloudflare build && opennextjs-cloudflare deploy",  
    "cf-typegen": "wrangler types --env-interface CloudflareEnv cloudflare-env.d.ts"  
  }  
}  
```  
Script usage

  * `preview`: Builds your app and serves it locally in the Workers runtime.
  * `deploy`: Builds your app and deploys it to Cloudflare Workers.
  * `cf-typegen`: Generates `cloudflare-env.d.ts` with Cloudflare binding types.
6. **Develop locally.**  
Start the Next.js development server.  
npmyarnpnpm  
```  
npm run dev  
```  
```  
yarn run dev  
```  
```  
pnpm run dev  
```
7. **Preview with OpenNext.**  
Preview your application in the Workers runtime.  
npmyarnpnpm  
```  
npm run preview  
```  
```  
yarn run preview  
```  
```  
pnpm run preview  
```
8. **Deploy your project.**  
Deploy your project to Cloudflare Workers.  
npmyarnpnpm  
```  
npm run deploy  
```  
```  
yarn run deploy  
```  
```  
pnpm run deploy  
```

Workers Builds

[Workers Builds](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/ci-cd/builds/) requires you to configure environment variables in [Build variables and secrets](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/ci-cd/builds/configuration/#build-variables-and-secrets).

This ensures the Next.js build has access to both public `NEXT_PUBLIC_` variables and non-public variables required for static generation and server-side build work. For more information, refer to [OpenNext environment variables ↗](https://opennext.js.org/cloudflare/howtos/env-vars#workers-builds).
