# Solid

Last updated Apr 23, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/framework-guides/web-apps/more-web-frameworks/solid/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Note

Support for SolidStart projects on Cloudflare Workers is currently in beta.

Already have a Solid Start project?

Run `wrangler deploy` in a project without a Wrangler configuration file and Wrangler will automatically detect Solid Start, generate the necessary configuration, and deploy your project.

npmyarnpnpm

```
npx wrangler deploy
```

```
yarn wrangler deploy
```

```
pnpm wrangler deploy
```

Learn more about [automatic project configuration](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/framework-guides/automatic-configuration/).

Wrangler handles configuration automatically

In this guide, you will create a new [Solid ↗](https://www.solidjs.com/) application and deploy to Cloudflare Workers (with the new [Workers Assets](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/static-assets/)).

## 1\. Set up a new project

Use the [create-cloudflare ↗](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-cloudflare) CLI (C3) to set up a new project. C3 will create a new project directory, initiate Solid's official setup tool, and provide the option to deploy instantly.

To use `create-cloudflare` to create a new Solid project with Workers Assets, run the following command:

npmyarnpnpm

```
npm create cloudflare@latest -- my-solid-app --framework=solid --experimental
```

```
yarn create cloudflare my-solid-app --framework=solid --experimental
```

```
pnpm create cloudflare@latest my-solid-app --framework=solid --experimental
```

After setting up your project, change your directory by running the following command:

```sh
cd my-solid-app
```

## 2\. Develop locally

After you have created your project, run the following command in the project directory to start a local server. This will allow you to preview your project locally during development.

npmyarnpnpm

```
npm run dev
```

```
yarn run dev
```

```
pnpm run dev
```

## 3\. Deploy your Project

Your project can be deployed to a `*.workers.dev` subdomain or a [Custom Domain](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/routing/custom-domains/), from your own machine or from any CI/CD system, including [Cloudflare's own](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/ci-cd/builds/).

The following command will build and deploy your project. If you're using CI, ensure you update your ["deploy command"](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/ci-cd/builds/configuration/#build-settings) configuration appropriately.

npmyarnpnpm

```
npm run deploy
```

```
yarn run deploy
```

```
pnpm run deploy
```

## Bindings

Your Solid application can be fully integrated with the Cloudflare Developer Platform, in both local development and in production, by using product bindings. The [Solid documentation ↗](https://docs.solidjs.com/reference/server-utilities/get-request-event) provides information about how to access platform primitives, including bindings. Specifically, for Cloudflare, you can use [getRequestEvent().nativeEvent.context.cloudflare.env ↗](https://docs.solidjs.com/solid-start/advanced/request-events#nativeevent) to access bindings.

With bindings, your application can be fully integrated with the Cloudflare Developer Platform, giving you access to compute, storage, AI and more.
