# Angular

Last updated Apr 23, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/framework-guides/web-apps/more-web-frameworks/angular/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

In this guide, you will create a new [Angular ↗](https://angular.dev/) application and deploy to Cloudflare Workers (with the new [Workers Assets](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/static-assets/)).

Automatic configuration

Run `wrangler deploy` in a project without a Wrangler configuration file and Wrangler will automatically detect Angular, generate the necessary configuration, and deploy your project.

npmyarnpnpm

```
npx wrangler deploy
```

```
yarn wrangler deploy
```

```
pnpm wrangler deploy
```

Learn more about [automatic project configuration](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/framework-guides/automatic-configuration/).

Wrangler handles configuration automatically

## 1\. Set up a new project

Use the [create-cloudflare ↗](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-cloudflare) CLI (C3) to set up a new project. C3 will create a new project directory, initiate Angular's official setup tool, and provide the option to deploy instantly.

To use `create-cloudflare` to create a new Angular project with Workers Assets, run the following command:

npmyarnpnpm

```
npm create cloudflare@latest -- my-angular-app --framework=angular
```

```
yarn create cloudflare my-angular-app --framework=angular
```

```
pnpm create cloudflare@latest my-angular-app --framework=angular
```

After setting up your project, change your directory by running the following command:

```sh
cd my-angular-app
```

## 2\. Develop locally

After you have created your project, run the following command in the project directory to start a local server. This will allow you to preview your project locally during development.

npmyarnpnpm

```
npm run start
```

```
yarn run start
```

```
pnpm run start
```

## 3\. Deploy your Project

Your project can be deployed to a `*.workers.dev` subdomain or a [Custom Domain](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/routing/custom-domains/), from your own machine or from any CI/CD system, including [Cloudflare's own](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/ci-cd/builds/).

The following command will build and deploy your project. If you're using CI, ensure you update your ["deploy command"](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/ci-cd/builds/configuration/#build-settings) configuration appropriately.

npmyarnpnpm

```
npm run deploy
```

```
yarn run deploy
```

```
pnpm run deploy
```

## Static assets

By default, Cloudflare first tries to match a request path against a static asset path, which is based on the file structure of the uploaded asset directory. This is either the directory specified by `assets.directory` in your Wrangler config or, in the case of the [Cloudflare Vite plugin](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/vite-plugin/), the output directory of the client build. Failing that, we invoke a Worker if one is present. If there is no Worker, or the Worker then uses the asset binding, Cloudflare will fallback to the behaviour set by [not\_found\_handling](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/static-assets/#routing-behavior).

Refer to the [routing documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/static-assets/routing/) for more information about how routing works with static assets, and how to customize this behavior.
