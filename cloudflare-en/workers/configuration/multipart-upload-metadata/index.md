# Multipart upload metadata

Last updated Jul 3, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/multipart-upload-metadata/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Note

There is a new API for uploading Workers. Refer to [these docs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/infrastructure-as-code#cloudflare-rest-api) for more information.

If you're using the [Workers Script Upload API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/workers/subresources/scripts/methods/update/) or [Version Upload API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/workers/subresources/scripts/subresources/versions/methods/create/) directly, `multipart/form-data` uploads require you to specify a `metadata` part. This metadata defines the Worker's configuration in JSON format, analogue to the [wrangler.toml file](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/).

## Sample `metadata`

```json
{
	"main_module": "main.js",
	"bindings": [
		{
			"type": "plain_text",
			"name": "MESSAGE",
			"text": "Hello, world!"
		}
	],
	"compatibility_date": "2021-09-14"
}
```

Note

See examples of metadata being used with the Workers Script Upload API [here](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/infrastructure-as-code#cloudflare-rest-api).

## Attributes

The following attributes are configurable at the top-level.

Note

At a minimum, the `main_module` key is required to upload a Worker.

* `main_module` `string`required

  * The part name that contains the module entry point of the Worker that will be executed. For example, `main.js`.
* `assets` `object`optional

  * [Asset](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/static-assets/) configuration for a Worker.
  * `config` `object`optional  
    * [html\_handling](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/static-assets/routing/advanced/html-handling/) determines the redirects and rewrites of requests for HTML content.
    * [not\_found\_handling](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/static-assets/#routing-behavior) determines the response when a request does not match a static asset.
  * `jwt` field provides a token authorizing assets to be attached to a Worker.
* `keep_assets` `boolean`optional

  * Specifies whether assets should be retained from a previously uploaded Worker version; used in lieu of providing a completion token.
* `bindings` array\[object\] optional

  * [Bindings](#bindings) to expose in the Worker.
* `placement` `object`optional

  * [Smart placement](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/placement/) object for the Worker.
  * `mode` field only supports `smart` for automatic placement.
* `compatibility_date` `string`optional

  * [Compatibility Date](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/compatibility-dates/#setting-compatibility-date) indicating targeted support in the Workers runtime. Backwards incompatible fixes to the runtime following this date will not affect this Worker. Highly recommended to set a `compatibility_date`, otherwise if on upload via the API, it defaults to the oldest compatibility date before any flags took effect (2021-11-02).
* `compatibility_flags` array\[string\] optional

  * [Compatibility Flags](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/compatibility-flags/#setting-compatibility-flags) that enable or disable certain features in the Workers runtime. Used to enable upcoming features or opt in or out of specific changes not included in a `compatibility_date`.

## Additional attributes: [Workers Script Upload API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/workers/subresources/scripts/methods/update/)

For [immediately deployed uploads](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/versions-and-deployments/#upload-a-new-version-and-deploy-it-immediately), the following **additional** attributes are configurable at the top-level.

Note

Except for `annotations`, these attributes are **not available** for version uploads.

* `migrations` array\[object\] optional

  * [Durable Objects migrations](https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/reference/durable-objects-migrations/) to apply.
* `logpush` `boolean`optional

  * Whether [Logpush](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/hostname-analytics/#logpush) is turned on for the Worker.
* `tail_consumers` array\[object\] optional

  * [Tail Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/observability/logs/tail-workers/) that will consume logs from the attached Worker.
* `tags` array\[string\] optional

  * List of strings to use as tags for this Worker.
* `annotations` `object`optional

  * Annotations object for the Worker version created by this upload. Also available on the [Version Upload API](#additional-attributes-version-upload-api).
  * `workers/message` specifies a custom message for the version.
  * `workers/tag` specifies a custom identifier for the version.

## Additional attributes: [Version Upload API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/workers/subresources/scripts/subresources/versions/methods/create/)

For [version uploads](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/versions-and-deployments/#upload-a-new-version-to-be-gradually-deployed-or-deployed-at-a-later-time), the following **additional** attributes are configurable at the top-level.

* `annotations` `object`optional  
  * Annotations object specific to the Worker version.
  * `workers/message` specifies a custom message for the version.
  * `workers/tag` specifies a custom identifier for the version.
  * `workers/alias` specifies a custom alias for this version.

## Bindings

Workers can interact with resources on the Cloudflare Developer Platform using [bindings](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/). Refer to the JSON example below that shows how to add bindings in the `metadata` part.

```json
{
	"bindings": [
		{
			"type": "ai",
			"name": "<VARIABLE_NAME>"
		},
		{
			"type": "analytics_engine",
			"name": "<VARIABLE_NAME>",
			"dataset": "<DATASET>"
		},
		{
			"type": "assets",
			"name": "<VARIABLE_NAME>"
		},
		{
			"type": "browser_rendering",
			"name": "<VARIABLE_NAME>"
		},
		{
			"type": "d1",
			"name": "<VARIABLE_NAME>",
			"id": "<D1_ID>"
		},
		{
			"type": "durable_object_namespace",
			"name": "<VARIABLE_NAME>",
			"class_name": "<DO_CLASS_NAME>"
		},
		{
			"type": "hyperdrive",
			"name": "<VARIABLE_NAME>",
			"id": "<HYPERDRIVE_ID>"
		},
		{
			"type": "kv_namespace",
			"name": "<VARIABLE_NAME>",
			"namespace_id": "<KV_ID>"
		},
		{
			"type": "mtls_certificate",
			"name": "<VARIABLE_NAME>",
			"certificate_id": "<MTLS_CERTIFICATE_ID>"
		},
		{
			"type": "plain_text",
			"name": "<VARIABLE_NAME>",
			"text": "<VARIABLE_VALUE>"
		},
		{
			"type": "queue",
			"name": "<VARIABLE_NAME>",
			"queue_name": "<QUEUE_NAME>"
		},
		{
			"type": "r2_bucket",
			"name": "<VARIABLE_NAME>",
			"bucket_name": "<R2_BUCKET_NAME>"
		},
		{
			"type": "secret_text",
			"name": "<VARIABLE_NAME>",
			"text": "<SECRET_VALUE>"
		},
		{
			"type": "service",
			"name": "<VARIABLE_NAME>",
			"service": "<SERVICE_NAME>",
			"environment": "production"
		},
		{
			"type": "vectorize",
			"name": "<VARIABLE_NAME>",
			"index_name": "<INDEX_NAME>"
		},
		{
			"type": "version_metadata",
			"name": "<VARIABLE_NAME>"
		}
	]
}
```
