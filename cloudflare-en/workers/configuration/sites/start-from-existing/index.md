# Start from existing

Use Workers Static Assets Instead

You should use [Workers Static Assets](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/static-assets/) to host full-stack applications instead of Workers Sites. It has been deprecated in Wrangler v4, and the [Cloudflare Vite plugin](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/vite-plugin/) does not support Workers Sites. Do not use Workers Sites for new projects.

Workers Sites require [Wrangler ↗](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/tree/main/packages/wrangler) — make sure to use the [latest version](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/#update-wrangler).

To deploy a pre-existing static site project, start with a pre-generated site. Workers Sites works with all static site generators, for example:

* [Hugo ↗](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/)
* [Gatsby ↗](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/quick-start/), requires Node
* [Jekyll ↗](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/), requires Ruby
* [Eleventy ↗](https://www.11ty.io/#quick-start), requires Node
* [WordPress ↗](https://wordpress.org) (refer to the tutorial on [deploying static WordPress sites with Pages](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/how-to/deploy-a-wordpress-site/))

## Getting started

1. Run the `wrangler init` command in the root of your project's directory to generate a basic Worker:  
```sh  
wrangler init -y  
```  
This command adds/update the following files:

  * `wrangler.jsonc`: The file containing project configuration.
  * `package.json`: Wrangler `devDependencies` are added.
  * `tsconfig.json`: Added if not already there to support writing the Worker in TypeScript.
  * `src/index.ts`: A basic Cloudflare Worker, written in TypeScript.
2. Add your site's build/output directory to the Wrangler file:  
```jsonc  
{  
  "site": {  
    "bucket": "./public" // <-- Add your build directory name here.  
  }  
}  
```  
```toml  
[site]  
bucket = "./public"  
```  
The default directories for the most popular static site generators are listed below:

  * Hugo: `public`
  * Gatsby: `public`
  * Jekyll: `_site`
  * Eleventy: `_site`
3. Install the `@cloudflare/kv-asset-handler` package in your project:  
```sh  
npm i -D @cloudflare/kv-asset-handler  
```
4. Replace the contents of `src/index.ts` with the following code snippet:

```js
import { getAssetFromKV } from "@cloudflare/kv-asset-handler";
import manifestJSON from "__STATIC_CONTENT_MANIFEST";
const assetManifest = JSON.parse(manifestJSON);

export default {
	async fetch(request, env, ctx) {
		try {
			// Add logic to decide whether to serve an asset or run your original Worker code
			return await getAssetFromKV(
				{
					request,
					waitUntil: ctx.waitUntil.bind(ctx),
				},
				{
					ASSET_NAMESPACE: env.__STATIC_CONTENT,
					ASSET_MANIFEST: assetManifest,
				},
			);
		} catch (e) {
			let pathname = new URL(request.url).pathname;
			return new Response(`"${pathname}" not found`, {
				status: 404,
				statusText: "not found",
			});
		}
	},
};
```

Service Workers are deprecated

Service Workers are deprecated, but still supported. We recommend using [Module Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/reference/migrate-to-module-workers/) instead. New features may not be supported for Service Workers.

```js
import { getAssetFromKV } from "@cloudflare/kv-asset-handler";

addEventListener("fetch", (event) => {
	event.respondWith(handleEvent(event));
});

async function handleEvent(event) {
	try {
		// Add logic to decide whether to serve an asset or run your original Worker code
		return await getAssetFromKV(event);
	} catch (e) {
		let pathname = new URL(event.request.url).pathname;
		return new Response(`"${pathname}" not found`, {
			status: 404,
			statusText: "not found",
		});
	}
}
```

1. Run `wrangler dev` or `npx wrangler deploy` to preview or deploy your site on Cloudflare. Wrangler will automatically upload the assets found in the configured directory.  
```sh  
npx wrangler deploy  
```
2. Deploy your site to a [custom domain](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/routing/custom-domains/) that you own and have already attached as a Cloudflare zone. Add a `route` property to the Wrangler file.  
```jsonc  
{  
  "route": "https://example.com/*"  
}  
```  
```toml  
route = "https://example.com/*"  
```  
Note  
Refer to the documentation on [Routes](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/routing/routes/) to configure a `route` properly.
