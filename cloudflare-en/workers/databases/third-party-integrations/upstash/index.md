# Upstash

Last updated Apr 23, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/databases/third-party-integrations/upstash/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

[Upstash ↗](https://upstash.com/) is a serverless database with Redis\* and Kafka API. Upstash also offers QStash, a task queue/scheduler designed for the serverless.

## Upstash for Redis

To set up an integration with Upstash:

1. You need an existing Upstash database to connect to. [Create an Upstash database ↗](https://docs.upstash.com/redis#create-a-database) or [load data from an existing database to Upstash ↗](https://docs.upstash.com/redis/howto/connectclient).
2. Insert some data to your Upstash database. You can add data to your Upstash database in two ways:

  * Use the CLI directly from your Upstash console.
  * Alternatively, install [redis-cli ↗](https://redis.io/docs/getting-started/installation/) locally and run the following commands.  
```sh  
set GB "Ey up?"  
```  
```sh  
OK  
```  
```sh  
set US "Yo, what’s up?"  
```  
```sh  
OK  
```  
```sh  
set NL "Hoi, hoe gaat het?"  
```  
```sh  
OK  
```
3. Configure the Upstash Redis credentials in your Worker:  
You need to add your Upstash Redis database URL and token as secrets to your Worker. Get these from your [Upstash Console ↗](https://console.upstash.com) under your database details, then add them as secrets using Wrangler:  
```sh  
# Add the Upstash Redis URL as a secret  
npx wrangler secret put UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL  
# When prompted, paste your Upstash Redis REST URL  
# Add the Upstash Redis token as a secret  
npx wrangler secret put UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN  
# When prompted, paste your Upstash Redis REST token  
```
4. In your Worker, install the `@upstash/redis`, a HTTP client to connect to your database and start manipulating data:  
npmyarnpnpmbun  
```  
npm i @upstash/redis  
```  
```  
yarn add @upstash/redis  
```  
```  
pnpm add @upstash/redis  
```  
```  
bun add @upstash/redis  
```
5. The following example shows how to make a query to your Upstash database in a Worker. The credentials needed to connect to Upstash have been added as secrets to your Worker.  
```js  
import { Redis } from "@upstash/redis/cloudflare";  
export default {  
	async fetch(request, env) {  
		const redis = Redis.fromEnv(env);  
		const country = request.headers.get("cf-ipcountry");  
		if (country) {  
			const greeting = await redis.get(country);  
			if (greeting) {  
				return new Response(greeting);  
			}  
		}  
		return new Response("Hello What's up!");  
	},  
};  
```  
Note  
`Redis.fromEnv(env)` automatically picks up the default `url` and `token` names created in the integration.  
If you have renamed the secrets, you must declare them explicitly like in the [Upstash basic example ↗](https://docs.upstash.com/redis/sdks/redis-ts/getstarted#basic-usage).

To learn more about Upstash, refer to the [Upstash documentation ↗](https://docs.upstash.com/redis).

## Upstash QStash

To set up an integration with Upstash QStash:

1. Configure the [publicly available HTTP endpoint ↗](https://docs.upstash.com/qstash#1-public-api) that you want to send your messages to.
2. Configure the Upstash QStash credentials in your Worker:  
You need to add your Upstash QStash token as a secret to your Worker. Get your token from your [Upstash Console ↗](https://console.upstash.com) under QStash settings, then add it as a secret using Wrangler:  
```sh  
# Add the QStash token as a secret  
npx wrangler secret put QSTASH_TOKEN  
# When prompted, paste your QStash token  
```
3. In your Worker, install the `@upstash/qstash`, a HTTP client to connect to your database QStash endpoint:  
npmyarnpnpmbun  
```  
npm i @upstash/qstash  
```  
```  
yarn add @upstash/qstash  
```  
```  
pnpm add @upstash/qstash  
```  
```  
bun add @upstash/qstash  
```
4. Refer to the [Upstash documentation on how to receive webhooks from QStash in your Cloudflare Worker ↗](https://docs.upstash.com/qstash/quickstarts/cloudflare-workers#3-use-qstash-in-your-handler).
