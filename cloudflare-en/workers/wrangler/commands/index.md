## How to run Wrangler commands

```txt
wrangler <COMMAND> <SUBCOMMAND> [PARAMETERS] [OPTIONS]
```

Since Cloudflare recommends [installing Wrangler locally](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/) in your project (rather than globally), the way to run Wrangler will depend on your specific setup and package manager.

npmyarnpnpm

```
npx wrangler <COMMAND> <SUBCOMMAND> [PARAMETERS] [OPTIONS]
```

```
yarn wrangler <COMMAND> <SUBCOMMAND> [PARAMETERS] [OPTIONS]
```

```
pnpm wrangler <COMMAND> <SUBCOMMAND> [PARAMETERS] [OPTIONS]
```

You can add Wrangler commands that you use often as scripts in your project's `package.json` file:

```json
{
  ...
  "scripts": {
    "deploy": "wrangler deploy",
    "dev": "wrangler dev"
  }
  ...
}
```

You can then run them using your package manager of choice:

npmyarnpnpm

```
npm run deploy
```

```
yarn run deploy
```

```
pnpm run deploy
```
