# Full-stack application

Last updated Apr 23, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/static-assets/routing/full-stack-application/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Full-stack applications are web applications which are span both the client and server. The build process of these applications will produce a HTML files, accompanying client-side resources (e.g. JavaScript bundles, CSS stylesheets, images, fonts, etc.) and a Worker script. Data is typically fetched the Worker script at request-time and the initial page response is usually server-side rendered (SSR). From there, the client is then hydrated and a SPA-like experience ensues.

The following full-stack frameworks are natively supported by Workers:

* [Astro](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/framework-guides/web-apps/astro/)
