# Vite plugin

Last updated Jul 3, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/vite-plugin/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

The Cloudflare Vite plugin enables a full-featured integration between [Vite ↗](https://vite.dev/) and the [Workers runtime](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/). Your Worker code runs inside [workerd ↗](https://github.com/cloudflare/workerd), matching the production behavior as closely as possible and providing confidence as you develop and deploy your applications.

## Features

* Uses the Vite [Environment API ↗](https://vite.dev/guide/api-environment) to integrate Vite with the Workers runtime
* Provides direct access to [Workers runtime APIs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/) and [bindings](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/)
* Builds your front-end assets for deployment to Cloudflare, enabling you to build static sites, SPAs, and full-stack applications
* Official support for [TanStack Start ↗](https://tanstack.com/start/) and [React Router v8 ↗](https://reactrouter.com/) with server-side rendering
* Leverages Vite's hot module replacement for consistently fast updates
* Supports `vite preview` for previewing your build output in the Workers runtime prior to deployment

## Use cases

* [TanStack Start ↗](https://tanstack.com/start/)
* [React Router v8 ↗](https://reactrouter.com/)
* Static sites, such as single-page applications, with or without an integrated backend API
* Standalone Workers
* Multi-Worker applications

## Get started

To create a new application from a ready-to-go template, refer to the [TanStack Start](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/framework-guides/web-apps/tanstack-start/), [React Router](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/framework-guides/web-apps/react-router/), [React](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/framework-guides/web-apps/react/) or [Vue](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/framework-guides/web-apps/vue/) framework guides.

To create a standalone Worker from scratch, refer to [Get started](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/vite-plugin/get-started/).
