# Git integration

Last updated Sep 23, 2026|Copy as Markdown| [View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/ci-cd/builds/git-integration/index.md)| [Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Cloudflare supports connecting your [GitHub](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/ci-cd/builds/git-integration/github-integration/), [GitLab](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/ci-cd/builds/git-integration/gitlab-integration/), or [Cursor Origin](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/ci-cd/builds/git-integration/cursor-origin-integration/) (Cursor's Git hosting platform) repository to your Cloudflare Worker, and will automatically deploy your code every time you push a change.

Adding a Git integration also lets you monitor build statuses directly in your Git provider. [GitHub](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/ci-cd/builds/git-integration/github-integration/#features) and [Cursor Origin](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/ci-cd/builds/git-integration/cursor-origin-integration/#features) use pull request comments and check runs, while [GitLab](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/ci-cd/builds/git-integration/gitlab-integration/#features) uses commit statuses, so you can manage deployments without leaving your workflow.

## Supported Git Providers

Cloudflare supports connecting Cloudflare Workers to your GitHub, GitLab, and Cursor Origin repositories. Workers Builds does not currently support connecting self-hosted instances of GitHub or GitLab.

If you are using a different Git provider (e.g. Bitbucket), you can use an [external CI/CD provider (e.g. GitHub Actions)](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/ci-cd/external-cicd/) and deploy using [Wrangler CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/commands/general/#deploy).

## Add a Git Integration

Workers Builds provides direct integration with GitHub and GitLab accounts that are *not* self-hosted, as well as Cursor Origin user and team repositories.

When connecting a GitHub or GitLab repository for the first time, follow the prompts in the Cloudflare dashboard to authorize the Git provider. To connect Cursor Origin, install the [Cloudflare app in Cursor ↗︎](https://cursor.com/codebase/settings/apps/public/cloudflare) and follow the installation prompts.

You can check the following pages to see if your Git integration has been installed:

- [GitHub Applications page ↗︎](https://github.com/settings/installations) (if you are in an organization, select **Switch settings context** to access your GitHub organization settings)
- [GitLab Authorized Applications page ↗︎](https://gitlab.com/-/profile/applications)
- [Cursor codebase settings ↗︎](https://cursor.com/codebase/settings/apps)

For details on managing provider access, refer to the [GitHub](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/ci-cd/builds/git-integration/github-integration/#organizational-access), [GitLab](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/ci-cd/builds/git-integration/gitlab-integration/#organizational-access), and [Cursor Origin](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/ci-cd/builds/git-integration/cursor-origin-integration/#team-access) integration guides.

## Manage a Git Integration

To manage your Git installation:

1. Go to the **Workers & Pages** page in the Cloudflare dashboard. [Go to **Workers & Pages** ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/workers-and-pages)
2. Select your Worker.
3. Go to **Settings** > **Builds**.
4. Under **Git Repository**, select **Manage**.

This can be useful for managing repository access or troubleshooting installation issues by reinstalling. For more details on how to manage your installation, refer to the [GitHub](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/ci-cd/builds/git-integration/github-integration/), [GitLab](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/ci-cd/builds/git-integration/gitlab-integration/), and [Cursor Origin](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/ci-cd/builds/git-integration/cursor-origin-integration/) guides.
