# Build branches

Last updated Aug 13, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/ci-cd/builds/build-branches/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

When you connect a git repository to Workers, commits made on the production git branch will produce a Workers Build. If you want to take advantage of [preview URLs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/versions-and-deployments/preview-urls/) and [pull request comments](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/ci-cd/builds/git-integration/github-integration/#pull-request-comment), you can additionally enable "non-production branch builds" in order to trigger a build on all branches of your repository.

Note

[Preview URLs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/versions-and-deployments/preview-urls/) are not generated for Workers that implement a [Durable Object](https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/), including [Containers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/containers/) and [Sandbox](https://developers.cloudflare.com/sandbox/) Workers. Refer to [Deploy Containers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/containers/deploy/#before-production) if your Worker uses containers.

## Change production branch

To change the production branch of your project:

1. In **Overview**, select your Workers project.
2. Go to **Settings** \> **Build** \> **Branch control**. Workers will default to the default branch of your git repository, but this can be changed in the dropdown.

Every push event made to this branch will trigger a build and execute the [build command](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/ci-cd/builds/configuration/#deploy-command), followed by the [deploy command](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/ci-cd/builds/configuration/#deploy-command).

## Configure non-production branch builds

To enable or disable non-production branch builds:

1. In **Overview**, select your Workers project.
2. Go to **Settings** \> **Build** \> **Branch control**. The checkbox **Builds for non-production branches** allows you to enable or disable builds for non-production branches.

When enabled, every push event made to a non-production branch will trigger a build and execute the [build command](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/ci-cd/builds/configuration/#deploy-command), followed by the [non-production branch deploy command](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/ci-cd/builds/configuration/#non-production-branch-deploy-command).
