# TypeScript

Last updated Jul 3, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/languages/typescript/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

TypeScript is a first-class language on Cloudflare Workers. All APIs provided in Workers are fully typed, and type definitions are generated directly from [workerd ↗](https://github.com/cloudflare/workerd), the open-source Workers runtime.

We recommend you generate types for your Worker by running [wrangler types](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/commands/general/#types). Cloudflare also publishes type definitions to [GitHub ↗](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-types) and [npm ↗](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cloudflare/workers-types) (`npm install -D @cloudflare/workers-types`).

Version 5 and later

`@cloudflare/workers-types` version 5 exposes only the latest runtime types. The dated entrypoints, such as `@cloudflare/workers-types/2022-11-30`, are removed. Import from `@cloudflare/workers-types` for the latest stable types, or from `@cloudflare/workers-types/experimental` for APIs behind experimental compatibility flags. To match types to a specific compatibility date and flags, run [wrangler types](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/commands/general/#types).

### 

Generate types that match your Worker's configuration

Cloudflare continuously improves [workerd ↗](https://github.com/cloudflare/workerd), the open-source Workers runtime. Changes in workerd can introduce JavaScript API changes, thus changing the respective TypeScript types.

This means the correct types for your Worker depend on:

1. Your Worker's [compatibility date](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/compatibility-dates/).
2. Your Worker's [compatibility flags](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/compatibility-flags/).
3. Your Worker's bindings, which are defined in your [Wrangler configuration file](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration).
4. Any [module rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/#bundling) you have specified in your Wrangler configuration file under `rules`.

For example, the runtime will only allow you to use the [AsyncLocalStorage ↗](https://nodejs.org/api/async%5Fcontext.html#class-asynclocalstorage) class if you have `compatibility_flags = ["nodejs_als"]` in your [Wrangler configuration file](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/). This should be reflected in the type definitions.

To ensure that your type definitions always match your Worker's configuration, you can dynamically generate types by running:

npmyarnpnpm

```
npx wrangler types
```

```
yarn wrangler types
```

```
pnpm wrangler types
```

See [the wrangler types command docs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/commands/general/#types) for more details.

Note

If you are running a version of Wrangler that is greater than `3.66.0` but below `4.0.0`, you will need to include the `--experimental-include-runtime` flag. During its experimental release, runtime types were output to a separate file (`.wrangler/types/runtime.d.ts` by default). If you have an older version of Wrangler, you can access runtime types through the `@cloudflare/workers-types` package.

This will generate a `d.ts` file and (by default) save it to `worker-configuration.d.ts`. This will include `Env` types based on your Worker bindings _and_ runtime types based on your Worker's compatibility date and flags.

You should then add that file to your `tsconfig.json`'s `compilerOptions.types` array. If you have the `nodejs_compat` compatibility flag, you should also install `@types/node`.

You can commit your types file to git if you wish.

Note

To ensure that your types are always up-to-date, make sure to run `wrangler types` after any changes to your config file.

### 

Migrating from `@cloudflare/workers-types` to `wrangler types`

We recommend you use `wrangler types` to generate runtime types, rather than using the `@cloudflare/workers-types` package, as it generates types based on your Worker's [compatibility date ↗](https://github.com/cloudflare/workerd/tree/main/npm/workers-types#compatibility-dates) and `compatibility flags`, ensuring that types match the exact runtime APIs made available to your Worker.

Note

There are no plans to stop publishing the `@cloudflare/workers-types` package, which will still be the recommended way to type libraries and shared packages in the workers environment.

#### 1\. Uninstall `@cloudflare/workers-types`

npmyarnpnpmbun

```
npm uninstall @cloudflare/workers-types
```

```
yarn remove @cloudflare/workers-types
```

```
pnpm remove @cloudflare/workers-types
```

```
bun remove @cloudflare/workers-types
```

#### 2\. Generate runtime types using Wrangler

npmyarnpnpm

```
npx wrangler types
```

```
yarn wrangler types
```

```
pnpm wrangler types
```

This will generate a `.d.ts` file, saved to `worker-configuration.d.ts` by default. This will also generate `Env` types. If for some reason you do not want to include those, you can set `--include-env=false`.

You can now remove any imports from `@cloudflare/workers-types` in your Worker code.

Note

If you are running a version of Wrangler that is greater than `3.66.0` but below `4.0.0`, you will need to include the `--experimental-include-runtime` flag. During its experimental release, runtime types were output to a separate file (`.wrangler/types/runtime.d.ts` by default). If you have an older version of Wrangler, you can access runtime types through the `@cloudflare/workers-types` package.

#### 3\. Make sure your `tsconfig.json` includes the generated types

```json
{
	"compilerOptions": {
		"types": ["./worker-configuration.d.ts"]
	}
}
```

Note that if you have specified a custom path for the runtime types file, you should use that in your `compilerOptions.types` array instead of the default path.

#### 4\. Add @types/node if you are using [nodejs\_compat](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/nodejs/) (Optional)

If you are using the `nodejs_compat` compatibility flag, you should also install `@types/node`.

npmyarnpnpmbun

```
npm i @types/node
```

```
yarn add @types/node
```

```
pnpm add @types/node
```

```
bun add @types/node
```

Then add this to your `tsconfig.json`.

```json
{
	"compilerOptions": {
		"types": ["./worker-configuration.d.ts", "node"]
	}
}
```

#### 5\. Update your scripts and CI pipelines

Regardless of your specific framework or build tools, you should run the `wrangler types` command before any tasks that rely on TypeScript.

Most projects will have existing build and development scripts, as well as some type-checking. In the example below, we're adding the `wrangler types` before the type-checking script in the project:

```json
{
	"scripts": {
		"dev": "existing-dev-command",
		"build": "existing-build-command",
		"generate-types": "wrangler types",
		"type-check": "generate-types && tsc"
	}
}
```

We recommend you commit your generated types file for use in CI. You can run `wrangler types` before other CI commands, as it should not take more than a few seconds. For example:

```yaml
- run: npm run generate-types
- run: npm run build
- run: npm test
```

```yaml
- run: yarn generate-types
- run: yarn build
- run: yarn test
```

```yaml
- run: pnpm run generate-types
- run: pnpm run build
- run: pnpm test
```

Alternatively, if you commit your generated types file and want to verify it stays up-to-date in CI, you can use the `--check` flag:

```yaml
- run: npx wrangler types --check
- run: npm run build
- run: npm test
```

```yaml
- run: yarn wrangler types --check
- run: yarn build
- run: yarn test
```

```yaml
- run: pnpm wrangler types --check
- run: pnpm run build
- run: pnpm test
```

This fails the CI job if the committed types file is out-of-date, prompting developers to regenerate and commit the updated types.
