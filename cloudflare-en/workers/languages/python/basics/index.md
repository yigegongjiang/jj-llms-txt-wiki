# The Basics

## Fetch Handler

As mentioned in the [introduction to Python Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/languages/python/), a Python Worker can be as simple as four lines of code:

```python
from workers import WorkerEntrypoint, Response

class Default(WorkerEntrypoint):
    async def fetch(self, request):
        return Response("Hello World!")
```

Similar to other Workers, the main entry point for a Python worker is the [fetch handler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/handlers/fetch) which handles incoming requests sent to the Worker.

In a Python Worker, this handler is placed in a `Default` class that extends the `WorkerEntrypoint` class (which you can import from the `workers` SDK module).

## The `Request` Interface

The `request` parameter passed to your `fetch` handler is a JavaScript Request object, exposed via the [foreign function interface (FFI)](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/languages/python/ffi), allowing you to access it directly from your Python code.

Let's try editing the worker to accept a POST request. We know from the [documentation for Request](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/request) that we can call `await request.json()` within an `async` function to parse the request body as JSON.

In a Python Worker, you would write:

```python
from workers import WorkerEntrypoint, Response
from hello import hello

class Default(WorkerEntrypoint):
    async def fetch(self, request):
        body = await request.json()
        name = body["name"]
        return Response(hello(name))
```

Many other JavaScript APIs are available in Python Workers via the FFI, so you can call other methods in a similar way.

Once you edit the `src/entry.py`, Wrangler will automatically restart the local development server.

Now, if you send a POST request with the appropriate body, your Worker will respond with a personalized message.

```bash
curl --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --request POST \
  --data '{"name": "Python"}' http://localhost:8787
```

```bash
Hello, Python!
```

## Return JSON responses

To return JSON from a Python Worker, use `Response.json()`:

```python
from workers import WorkerEntrypoint, Response

class Default(WorkerEntrypoint):
    async def fetch(self, request):
        data = {"message": "Hello", "status": "ok"}
        return Response.json(data)
```

## The `env` Attribute

The `env` attribute on the `WorkerEntrypoint` can be used to access [environment variables](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/environment-variables/), [secrets](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/secrets/), and [bindings](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/).

For example, let us try setting and using an environment variable in a Python Worker. First, add the environment variable to your Worker's [Wrangler configuration file](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/):

```jsonc
{
	"$schema": "./node_modules/wrangler/config-schema.json",
	"name": "hello-python-worker",
	"main": "src/entry.py",
	"compatibility_flags": [
		"python_workers"
	],
	// Set this to today's date
	"compatibility_date": "2026-07-24",
	"vars": {
		"API_HOST": "example.com"
	}
}
```

```toml
"$schema" = "./node_modules/wrangler/config-schema.json"
name = "hello-python-worker"
main = "src/entry.py"
compatibility_flags = [ "python_workers" ]
# Set this to today's date
compatibility_date = "2026-07-24"

[vars]
API_HOST = "example.com"
```

Then, you can access the `API_HOST` environment variable via the `env` parameter:

```python
from workers import WorkerEntrypoint, Response

class Default(WorkerEntrypoint):
    async def fetch(self, request):
        return Response(self.env.API_HOST)
```

## Modules

Python workers can be split across multiple files.

Let's create a new Python file, called `src/hello.py`:

```python
def hello(name):
    return "Hello, " + name + "!"
```

Now, we can modify `src/entry.py` to make use of the new module.

```python
from hello import hello
from workers import WorkerEntrypoint, Response

class Default(WorkerEntrypoint):
    async def fetch(self, request):
        return Response(hello("World"))
```

Once you edit `src/entry.py`, [pywrangler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/languages/python/#the-pywrangler-cli-tool) will automatically detect the change and reload your Worker.

## Types and Autocompletion

The `workers-runtime-sdk` package provides the runtime SDK for Python Workers. This package is automatically installed and included in your worker when you use `pywrangler`, but you can also install it manually to take advantage of type hints and autocompletion in your IDE.

To enable them, add the `workers-runtime-sdk` package to your `pyproject.toml` file.

```toml
dependencies = [
  "workers-runtime-sdk"
]
```

Additionally, you can generate types based on your Worker configuration using `uv run pywrangler types`

This includes `Env` types based on your bindings, module rules, and runtime types based on the `compatibility_date`and `compatibility_flags` in your config file. See

## Upgrading `pywrangler`

To upgrade to the latest version of [pywrangler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/languages/python/#the-pywrangler-cli-tool) globally, run the following command:

```bash
uv tool upgrade workers-py
```

To upgrade to the latest version of `pywrangler` in a specific project, run the following command:

```bash
uv lock --upgrade-package workers-py
```
