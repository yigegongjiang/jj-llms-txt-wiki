# Foreign Function Interface (FFI)

Last updated Jun 22, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/languages/python/ffi/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Via [Pyodide ↗](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/), Python Workers provide a [Foreign Function Interface (FFI) ↗](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign%5Ffunction%5Finterface) to JavaScript. This allows you to:

* Use [bindings](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/) to resources on Cloudflare, including [Workers AI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/), [Vectorize](https://developers.cloudflare.com/vectorize/), [R2](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/), [KV](https://developers.cloudflare.com/kv/), [D1](https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/), [Queues](https://developers.cloudflare.com/queues/), [Durable Objects](https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/), [Service Bindings](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/service-bindings/) and more.
* Use JavaScript globals, like [Request](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/request/), [Response](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/response/), and [fetch()](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/fetch/).
* Use the full feature set of Cloudflare Workers — if an API is accessible in JavaScript, you can also access it in a Python Worker, writing exclusively Python code.

The details of Pyodide's Foreign Function Interface are documented [here ↗](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/usage/type-conversions.html), and Workers written in Python are able to take full advantage of this.

## Using Bindings from Python Workers

Bindings allow your Worker to interact with resources on the Cloudflare Developer Platform. When you declare a binding on your Worker, you grant it a specific capability, such as being able to read and write files to an [R2](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/) bucket.

For example, to access a [KV](https://developers.cloudflare.com/kv) namespace from a Python Worker, you would declare the following in your Worker's [Wrangler configuration file](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/):

```jsonc
{
	"main": "./src/index.py",
	"kv_namespaces": [
		{
			"binding": "FOO",
			"id": "<YOUR_KV_NAMESPACE_ID>"
		}
	]
}
```

```toml
main = "./src/index.py"

[[kv_namespaces]]
binding = "FOO"
id = "<YOUR_KV_NAMESPACE_ID>"
```

...and then call `.get()` on the binding object that is exposed on `env`:

```python
from workers import WorkerEntrypoint, Response

class Default(WorkerEntrypoint):
    async def fetch(self, request):
        await self.env.FOO.put("bar", "baz")
        bar = await self.env.FOO.get("bar")
        return Response(bar) # returns "baz"
```

### Converting Python to JavaScript

Occasionally, to interoperate with JavaScript APIs, you may need to convert a Python object to JavaScript. Pyodide provides a `to_js` function to facilitate this conversion.

```python
from js import Object
from pyodide.ffi import to_js as _to_js

from workers import WorkerEntrypoint, Response

# to_js converts between Python dictionaries and JavaScript Objects
def to_js(obj):
   return _to_js(obj, dict_converter=Object.fromEntries)
```

For more details, see out the [documentation on pyodide.ffi.to\_js ↗](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/usage/api/python-api/ffi.html#pyodide.ffi.to%5Fjs).

## Using JavaScript globals from Python Workers

We recommend using the `workers` module, which is provided by our `workers-runtime-sdk` package, to access JavaScript globals in a more Pythonic way. However, if you need to access JavaScript globals directly for any reason, you can import them from the `js` module.

For example, note how `Response` is imported from `js` in the example below:

```python
from workers import WorkerEntrypoint
from js import Response

class Default(WorkerEntrypoint):
    async def fetch(self, request):
        return Response.new("Hello World!")
```

Refer to the [Python examples](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/languages/python/examples/) to learn how to call into JavaScript functions from Python, including `console.log` and logging, providing options to `Response`, and parsing JSON.
