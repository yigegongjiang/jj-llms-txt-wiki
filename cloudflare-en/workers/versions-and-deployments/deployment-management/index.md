# Deployment management

Last updated Jul 15, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/versions-and-deployments/deployment-management/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

By default, a new version is created and immediately deployed to 100% of traffic when you use any of the following:

* [wrangler deploy](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/commands/workers/#deploy)
* [Workers Builds](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/ci-cd/builds/)
* The [Workers Script Upload API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/workers/subresources/scripts/methods/update/)

You can separate these steps so that uploading a version and deploying it are independent actions. This lets you control exactly when a new version goes live.

## Upload a version without deploying

### Via Wrangler

Use the [wrangler versions upload](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/commands/workers/#versions-upload) command:

npmyarnpnpm

```
npx wrangler versions upload
```

```
yarn wrangler versions upload
```

```
pnpm wrangler versions upload
```

Note

Wrangler versions before 3.73.0 require you to specify a `--x-versions` flag.

Note

To apply changes to a Worker's triggers ([routes, domains](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/routing/), or [cron triggers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/cron-triggers/)), use the [wrangler triggers deploy](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/commands/workers/#triggers-deploy) command.

### Via the Cloudflare dashboard

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Workers & Pages** page.  
[Go to **Workers & Pages** ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/workers-and-pages)
2. Select your Worker > **Edit code**.
3. Make your changes, then select the **down arrow** next to **Deploy** \> **Save**.

Note

New versions are not created when you make changes to [resources connected to your Worker](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/). For example, if two Workers (Worker A and Worker B) are connected via a [service binding](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/service-bindings/), changing the code of Worker B will not create a new version of Worker A. Changes to the service binding configuration (such as deleting the binding or updating the [environment](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/environments/) it points to) on Worker A will also not create a new version of Worker B.

## Deploy an uploaded version

Once you have uploaded a version, you can create a deployment that routes traffic to it.

### Via Wrangler

Use the [wrangler versions deploy](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/commands/workers/#versions-deploy) command and follow the interactive prompts to select the version and set it to 100%:

npmyarnpnpm

```
npx wrangler versions deploy
```

```
yarn wrangler versions deploy
```

```
pnpm wrangler versions deploy
```

You can also set the traffic percentage to less than 100% to start a [gradual deployment](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/versions-and-deployments/gradual-deployments/).

### Via the Cloudflare dashboard

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Workers & Pages** page.  
[Go to **Workers & Pages** ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/workers-and-pages)
2. Select your Worker > **Deployments**.
3. Select **Promote deployment** and choose the version you want to deploy.

### Via Infrastructure as Code

You can also create versions and deployments directly with the API, library SDKs, and Terraform. Refer to [Infrastructure as Code](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/infrastructure-as-code/) for examples.

## Limits

### Deployments limit

You can only create a deployment with the last 100 uploaded versions of your Worker.

### First upload

You must use [C3](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/get-started/guide/#1-create-a-new-worker-project) or [wrangler deploy](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/commands/workers/#deploy) the first time you create a new Workers project. Using [wrangler versions upload](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/commands/workers/#versions-upload) the first time you upload a Worker will fail.

### Service worker syntax

Service worker syntax is not supported for versions that are uploaded through [wrangler versions upload](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/commands/workers/#versions-upload). You must use ES modules format.

Refer to [Migrate from Service Workers to ES modules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/reference/migrate-to-module-workers/#advantages-of-migrating) to learn how to migrate your Workers from the service worker format to the ES modules format.

### Durable Object migrations

Uploading a version that changes Durable Object class lifecycle is not supported. This applies to both the declarative [exports](https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/reference/durable-objects-migrations/) field and the legacy [migrations](https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/reference/durable-object-class-migrations-legacy/) array - any change that creates, deletes, renames, or transfers a Durable Object class must be applied through [wrangler deploy](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/commands/workers/#deploy).
