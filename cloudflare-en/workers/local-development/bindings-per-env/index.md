# Supported bindings per development mode

Last updated Jun 25, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/local-development/bindings-per-env/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

## Local development

**Local simulations**: During local development, your Worker code always executes locally and bindings connect to locally simulated resources [by default](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/local-development/#remote-bindings). This is supported in [wrangler dev](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/commands/general/#dev) and the [Cloudflare Vite plugin](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/vite-plugin/).

**Remote binding connections:**: Allows you to connect to remote resources on a [per-binding basis](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/local-development/#remote-bindings). This is supported in [wrangler dev](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/commands/general/#dev) and the [Cloudflare Vite plugin](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/vite-plugin/).

## Remote development

During remote development, all of your Worker code is uploaded and executed on Cloudflare's infrastructure, and bindings always connect to remote resources. **We recommend using local development with remote binding connections instead** for faster iteration and debugging.

Supported only in [wrangler dev --remote](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/commands/general/#dev) \- there is **no Vite plugin equivalent**.
