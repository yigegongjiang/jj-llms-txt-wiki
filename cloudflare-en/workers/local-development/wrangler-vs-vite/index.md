# Choosing between Wrangler & Vite

Last updated Jul 28, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/local-development/wrangler-vs-vite/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Wrangler and the Cloudflare Vite plugin both provide local development environments for Workers. Both support backend Workers, local and remote bindings, and multi-Worker applications.

Choose based on the build tools your project uses. You can also use the Vite plugin for development and builds while using Wrangler for deployment and other Workers commands.

Use the [Cloudflare Vite plugin](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/vite-plugin/) when your project already uses Vite or would benefit from its build pipeline. Vite is valid for standalone backend Workers, not only frontend applications.

Use [wrangler dev](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/commands/general/#dev) when your project does not use Vite or you want a direct command-line workflow. Wrangler also provides deployment and resource management commands.

For local development that requires deployed resources, both tools support [remote bindings](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/local-development/#remote-bindings). Your Worker runs locally while selected bindings connect to deployed Cloudflare resources.

For configuration differences when moving an existing project, refer to [Migrating from wrangler dev](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/vite-plugin/reference/migrating-from-wrangler-dev/).
