# Environment variables and secrets

Last updated Jun 25, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/local-development/environment-variables/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Caution

Do not use `vars` to store sensitive information in your Worker's Wrangler configuration file. Use secrets instead.

Put secrets for use in local development in either a `.dev.vars` file or a `.env` file, in the same directory as the Wrangler configuration file.

Note

You can use the [secrets configuration property](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/#secrets-configuration-property) to declare which secret names your Worker requires. When defined, only the keys listed in `secrets.required` are loaded from `.dev.vars` or `.env`. Additional keys are excluded and missing keys produce a warning.

Note

Choose to use either `.dev.vars` or `.env` but not both. If you define a `.dev.vars` file, then values in `.env` files will not be included in the `env` object during local development.

These files should be formatted using the [dotenv ↗](https://hexdocs.pm/dotenvy/dotenv-file-format.html) syntax. For example:

```bash
SECRET_KEY="value"
API_TOKEN="eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9"
```

Do not commit secrets to git

The `.dev.vars` and `.env` files should not be committed to git. Add `.dev.vars*` and `.env*` to your project's `.gitignore` file.

To set different secrets for each Cloudflare environment, create files named `.dev.vars.<environment-name>` or `.env.<environment-name>`.

When you select a Cloudflare environment in your local development, the corresponding environment-specific file will be loaded ahead of the generic `.dev.vars` (or `.env`) file.

* When using `.dev.vars.<environment-name>` files, all secrets must be defined per environment. If `.dev.vars.<environment-name>` exists then only this will be loaded; the `.dev.vars` file will not be loaded.
* In contrast, all matching `.env` files are loaded and the values are merged. For each variable, the value from the most specific file is used, with the following precedence:  
  * `.env.<environment-name>.local` (most specific)
  * `.env.local`
  * `.env.<environment-name>`
  * `.env` (least specific)

Controlling \`.env\` handling

It is possible to control how `.env` files are loaded in local development by setting environment variables on the process running the tools.

* To disable loading local dev vars from `.env` files without providing a `.dev.vars` file, set the `CLOUDFLARE_LOAD_DEV_VARS_FROM_DOT_ENV` environment variable to `"false"`.
* To include every environment variable defined in your system's process environment as a local development variable, ensure there is no `.dev.vars` and then set the `CLOUDFLARE_INCLUDE_PROCESS_ENV` environment variable to `"true"`. This is not needed when using the [secrets configuration property](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/#secrets-configuration-property), which loads from `process.env` automatically.

### Basic setup

Here are steps to set up environment variables for local development using either `.dev.vars` or `.env` files.

1. Create a `.dev.vars` / `.env` file in your project root.
2. Add key-value pairs:  
```ini  
API_HOST="localhost:3000"  
DEBUG="true"  
SECRET_TOKEN="my-local-secret-token"  
```
3. Run your `dev` command

**Wrangler**  
npmyarnpnpm  
```  
npx wrangler dev  
```  
```  
yarn wrangler dev  
```  
```  
pnpm wrangler dev  
```

**Vite plugin**  
npmyarnpnpm  
```  
npx vite dev  
```  
```  
yarn vite dev  
```  
```  
pnpm vite dev  
```

## Multiple local environments

To simulate different local environments, you can provide environment-specific files. For example, you might have a `staging` environment that requires different settings than your development environment.

1. Create a file named `.dev.vars.<environment-name>`/`.env.<environment-name>`. For example, we can use `.dev.vars.staging`/`.env.staging`.
2. Add key-value pairs:  
```ini  
API_HOST="staging.localhost:3000"  
DEBUG="false"  
SECRET_TOKEN="staging-token"  
```
3. Specify the environment when running the `dev` command:

**Wrangler**  
npmyarnpnpm  
```  
npx wrangler dev --env staging  
```  
```  
yarn wrangler dev --env staging  
```  
```  
pnpm wrangler dev --env staging  
```

**Vite plugin**  
npmyarnpnpm  
```  
CLOUDFLARE_ENV=staging npx vite dev  
```  
```  
CLOUDFLARE_ENV=staging yarn vite dev  
```  
```  
CLOUDFLARE_ENV=staging pnpm vite dev  
```

  * If using `.dev.vars.staging`, only the values from that file will be applied instead of `.dev.vars`.
  * If using `.env.staging`, the values will be merged with `.env` files, with the most specific file taking precedence.
