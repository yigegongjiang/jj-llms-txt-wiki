# IPv6 compatibility

Last updated Aug 14, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/network/ipv6-compatibility/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Cloudflare enables IPv6 on all domains without requiring additional configuration or hardware (as long as your host provides IPv6 support).

When IPv6 compatibility is turned on, Cloudflare auto generates [AAAA DNS records](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/manage-dns-records/reference/dns-record-types/#a-and-aaaa) to allow IPv6 clients to connect. On the other hand, when IPv6 compatibility is turned off, Cloudflare does not automatically generate and advertise `AAAA` DNS for the zone. Client software will determine whether to use IPv4 or IPv6 to connect to a hostname that supports both methods.

For [proxied DNS records](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/proxy-status/) that have both an IPv6 and IPv4 origin address, Cloudflare will prefer the IPv4 address when connecting to your origin server.

## Availability

|               | Free | Pro | Business | Enterprise |
| ------------- | ---- | --- | -------- | ---------- |
| Availability  | Yes  | Yes | Yes      | Yes        |
| Can customize | No   | No  | No       | Yes        |

## Enable IPv6 compatibility

By default, IPv6 compatibility is turned on for your domain and will apply to all domains and subdomains covered by [proxied DNS records](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/proxy-status/).

Note

If you have signed up for Cloudflare through a [Cloudflare hosting partner ↗](http://www.cloudflare.com/hosting-partners) or by use [partial setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/zone-setups/partial-setup/), IPv6 compatibility does not apply to your apex domain.

## Disable IPv6 compatibility

If your origin web server only understands IPv4 formatted IP addresses, non-Enterprise customers should [configure Pseudo IPv4](https://developers.cloudflare.com/network/pseudo-ipv4/).

Alternatively, customers with an Enterprise account can turn off Cloudflare's IPv6 compatibility.

Note

To allow IPv6-only clients to connect to IPv4-only origin web servers, keep IPv6 compatibility enabled and configure [Pseudo IPv4](https://developers.cloudflare.com/network/pseudo-ipv4/).

To turn off IPv6 compatibility in the dashboard:

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Network** page.  
[Go to **Network** ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/:zone/network)
2. Turn off **IPv6 Compatibility**.

To turn off IPv6 compatibility using the API, send a [PATCH](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/zones/subresources/settings/methods/edit/) request with `ipv6` as the setting name in the URI path, and the `value` parameter set to `"off"`.

Note

Even when IPv6 is turned off, domains may still receive IPv6 traffic (for example, via the Tor network). To completely turn off all IPv6 traffic:

* Turn off [**Onion Routing**](https://developers.cloudflare.com/network/onion-routing/).
* Use a [WAF custom rule](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/custom-rules/create-dashboard/) to block `0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0/0` using the condition `ip.src in {::/0}`.
* Add `and cf.worker.upstream_zone == ""` to the rule above to avoid blocking Workers subrequests. Workers subrequests use IPv6 addresses, and this condition checks that the request does not come from a Worker script. For more information, refer to the [cf.worker.upstream\_zone](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/rules-language/fields/reference/cf.worker.upstream%5Fzone/) field documentation.

## Troubleshoot an IPv6 network issue

Provide the following information to [Cloudflare Support](https://developers.cloudflare.com/support/contacting-cloudflare-support/) if you experience issues with IPv6 connectivity:

* A [traceroute](https://developers.cloudflare.com/support/troubleshooting/general-troubleshooting/gathering-information-for-troubleshooting-sites/#perform-a-traceroute) that demonstrates the IPv6 connection issues.
* The [Cloudflare data center serving your request](https://developers.cloudflare.com/support/troubleshooting/general-troubleshooting/gathering-information-for-troubleshooting-sites/#identify-the-cloudflare-data-center-serving-your-request) when the IPv6 issues occur.
* Confirmation of whether [disabling IPv6 Compatibility](#disable-ipv6-compatibility) resolves the issue.
