Last updated Apr 23, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/network/true-client-ip-header/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Enabling the True-Client-IP Header adds the [True-Client-IP header](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/reference/http-headers/#true-client-ip-enterprise-plan-only) to all requests to your origin server, which includes the end user's IP address.

## Add True-Client-IP Header

The recommended procedure to access client IP information is to [enable the **Add "True-Client-IP" header** Managed Transform](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/transform/managed-transforms/reference/#add-true-client-ip-header).

Note

To use this data, you will need to then retrieve it from the [True-Client-IP header](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/reference/http-headers/#cf-ipcountry).
