# Linux

Looking for Zero Trust?

This documentation is for the consumer version of WARP (1.1.1.1 with WARP). If you are using WARP for Zero Trust security, refer to the [Cloudflare One Client documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/cloudflare-one-client/).

You have two ways of installing WARP on Linux, depending on the distro you are using:

* Find the latest WARP client in the [package repository ↗](https://pkg.cloudflareclient.com/).
* Install the `cloudflare-warp` package that suits your distro:  
  * **apt-based OS** (like Ubuntu): `sudo apt install cloudflare-warp`.
  * **yum-based OS** (like CentOS or RHEL): `sudo yum install cloudflare-warp`.

Note

If you get an error message when trying to install via the terminal, download the package that suits your distro from the [package repository ↗](https://pkg.cloudflareclient.com/).

## Using WARP

The command line interface is the primary way to use WARP.

### Initial connection

To connect for the very first time:

1. Register the client `warp-cli registration new`.
2. Connect `warp-cli connect`.
3. Run `curl https://www.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/trace` and verify that `warp=on`.

### Switch modes

You can use `warp-cli mode --help` to get a list of modes to switch between. For example:

* **DNS only mode via DoH:** `warp-cli mode doh`
* **WARP with DoH:** `warp-cli mode warp+doh`

### Switch tunnel protocol

You can switch the protocol that WARP uses to route traffic from the device to Cloudflare.

* **WireGuard:** `warp-cli tunnel protocol set WireGuard`
* **MASQUE:** (default) `warp-cli tunnel protocol set MASQUE`

Note

The protocol values are case-sensitive.

For information on WireGuard versus MASQUE, refer to our [blog post ↗](https://blog.cloudflare.com/zero-trust-warp-with-a-masque).

### Using 1.1.1.1 for Families

The Linux client supports all 1.1.1.1 for Families modes, in either WARP on DNS-only mode:

* **Families mode off:** `warp-cli dns families off`
* **Malware protection:** `warp-cli dns families malware`
* **Malware and adult content:** `warp-cli dns families full`

### Enable WARP+ Unlimited

To enable [WARP+ Unlimited](https://developers.cloudflare.com/warp-client/warp-modes/#warp-unlimited) on Linux, you will need an iOS or Android device that has an existing WARP+ Unlimited subscription.

1. On your iOS or Android device, launch the **1.1.1.1 Faster Internet** app.
2. Go to **Settings** \> **Account** and copy the **Key** value.
3. On your Linux device, run the following command:  
```sh  
warp-cli registration license <KEY>  
```
4. Verify the new registration:  
```sh  
warp-cli registration show  
```  
```sh  
Account type: Unlimited  
...  
```

Your WARP+ Unlimited subscription is now active on this device.

### Additional commands

A complete list of all supported commands can be found by running:

```sh
warp-cli --help
```

## Feedback

You can find logs required to debug WARP issues by running `sudo warp-diag`. This will place a `warp-debugging-info.zip` file in the path from which you ran the command.

To report bugs or provide feedback to the team use the command `sudo warp-diag feedback`. This will submit a support ticket.
