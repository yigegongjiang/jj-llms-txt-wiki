# Verify APO works

Last updated Apr 16, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/automatic-platform-optimization/get-started/verify-apo-works/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

You can check whether or not APO is working by verifying APO headers are present. When APO is working, three headers are present: `CF-Cache-Status`, `cf-apo-via`, `cf-edge-cache`.

1. Visit [Uptrends.com ↗](https://www.uptrends.com/tools/http-response-header-check).
2. In the text field, enter the URL for your WordPress homepage including the `https://www.`.
3. Select **Start test**. The **Response Headers** table displays.
4. Locate the three header responses and their description. APO is working correctly when the headers exactly match the headers below.
* `CF-Cache-Status` | `HIT`  
  * The `cf-cache-status` header displays if the asset is served from the cache or was considered dynamic and served from the origin.
* `cf-apo-via` | `tcache`  
  * The `cf-apo-via` header returns the APO status for the given request.
* `cf-edge-cache` | `cache, platform=wordpress`  
  * The `cf-edge-cache` headers confirms the WordPress plugin is installed and enabled.

In a terminal, use the following cURL. The header `'accept: text/html'` is important.

```sh
curl -svo /dev/null -A "CF" 'https://example.com/' -H 'accept: text/html' 2>&1 | grep 'cf-cache-status\|cf-edge\|cf-apo-via'
```

```sh
< cf-cache-status: HIT
< cf-apo-via: cache
< cf-edge-cache: cache,platform=wordpress
```

As always, `cf-cache-status` displays if the asset hit the cache or was considered dynamic and served from the origin.

* `cf-apo-via` | `tcache`  
  * The `cf-apo-via` header returns the APO status for the given request.
* `cf-edge-cache` | `cache, platform=wordpress`  
  * The `cf-edge-cache` headers confirms the WordPress plugin is installed and enabled.

## Verify the APO integration and WordPress integration work

Open your WordPress site and publish a change. When the integration is working, the page is cached with `cf-cache-status: HIT` and `cf-apo-via: tcache`.
