## Get an entry point ruleset

You can get the definition of the [entry point ruleset](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/about/rulesets/#entry-point-ruleset) of a given [phase](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/about/phases/) at the zone or account level.

If the entry point ruleset exists, the API will return a `200 OK` HTTP status code, along with the ruleset definition.

If the entry point ruleset does not exist, the API will return a `404 Not Found` HTTP status code.

### Example: Get an entry point ruleset at the zone level

The following [GET request](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/rulesets/subresources/phases/methods/get/) obtains the definition of the entry point ruleset for the `http_request_firewall_managed` phase at the zone level. In this case, the entry point ruleset exists and contains one rule.
