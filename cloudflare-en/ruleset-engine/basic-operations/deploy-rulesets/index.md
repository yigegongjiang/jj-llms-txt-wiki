# Deploy rulesets

Last updated Apr 16, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/basic-operations/deploy-rulesets/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Use the [Rulesets API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/rulesets-api/) to deploy a ruleset. To deploy a ruleset, add a rule with `"action": "execute"` to a [phase entry point ruleset](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/about/rulesets/#entry-point-ruleset), specifying the ruleset ID to execute as an action parameter. Use a separate rule for each ruleset you want to deploy.

A rule that executes a ruleset consists of:

* The ID of the ruleset you want to execute, included in `action_parameters.id`.
* An expression.
* The `execute` action.

The rules in the ruleset execute when a request satisfies the expression.

Note

To apply a rule to every request in a phase at the zone level, set the rule expression to `true`.

## Example

The following example deploys the [Cloudflare Managed Ruleset](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/managed-rules/reference/cloudflare-managed-ruleset/) (with ID ...376e9aee) to the `http_request_firewall_managed` phase of a given zone (`$ZONE_ID`) by adding a rule that executes the managed ruleset.

* `Sanitize Write`
* `Transform Rules Write`
* `Select Configuration Write`
* `Bot Management Write`

```bash
curl "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/$ZONE_ID/rulesets/phases/http_request_firewall_managed/entrypoint" \
	--request PUT \
	--header "Authorization: Bearer $CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN" \
	--json '{
		"rules": [
				{
						"action": "execute",
						"action_parameters": {
								"id": "efb7b8c949ac4650a09736fc376e9aee"
						},
						"expression": "true",
						"description": "Execute Cloudflare Managed Ruleset on my zone ruleset"
				}
		]
	}'
```

```json
{
	"result": {
		"id": "<ZONE_PHASE_RULESET_ID>",
		"name": "Zone-level Ruleset 1",
		"description": "",
		"kind": "zone",
		"version": "latest",
		"rules": [
			{
				"id": "<RULE_ID>",
				"version": "1",
				"action": "execute",
				"action_parameters": {
					"id": "efb7b8c949ac4650a09736fc376e9aee",
					"version": "3"
				},
				"expression": "true",
				"description": "Execute Cloudflare Managed Ruleset on my zone ruleset",
				"last_updated": "2021-03-18T18:08:14.003361Z",
				"ref": "<RULE_REF>",
				"enabled": true
			}
		],
		"last_updated": "2021-03-18T18:08:14.003361Z",
		"phase": "http_request_firewall_managed"
	},
	"success": true,
	"errors": [],
	"messages": []
}
```

Caution

This API request replaces any existing rules in the `http_request_firewall_managed` phase entry point ruleset with a single rule.
