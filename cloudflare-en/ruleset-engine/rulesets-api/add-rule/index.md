# Add a rule to a ruleset

Last updated Apr 16, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/rulesets-api/add-rule/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Adds a single rule to an existing ruleset. Use this endpoint to add a rule without having to include all the existing ruleset rules in the request.

Use one of the following API endpoints:

* [Create an account ruleset rule](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/rulesets/subresources/rules/methods/create/)  
`POST /accounts/{account_id}/rulesets/{ruleset_id}/rules`
* [Create a zone ruleset rule](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/rulesets/subresources/rules/methods/create/)  
`POST /zones/{zone_id}/rulesets/{ruleset_id}/rules`

Include the rule definition in the request body.

By default, the rule will be added to the end of the existing list of rules in the ruleset. To define a specific position for the rule, include a `position` object in the request body according to the guidelines in [Change the order of a rule in a ruleset](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/rulesets-api/update-rule/#change-the-order-of-a-rule-in-a-ruleset).

Invoking this method creates a new version of the ruleset.

## Example

The following `POST` request adds a rule to ruleset `$RULESET_ID` of zone `$ZONE_ID`. The ruleset ID was previously obtained using the [List zone rulesets](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/rulesets/methods/list/) operation, and corresponds to the entry point ruleset for the `http_request_firewall_custom` phase.

The response will include the complete ruleset after adding the rule.

```bash
curl "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/$ZONE_ID/rulesets/$RULESET_ID/rules" \
	--request POST \
	--header "Authorization: Bearer $CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN" \
	--json '{

		"expression": "(ip.src.country in {\"GB\" \"FR\"} and cf.bot_management.score < 20 and not cf.bot_management.verified_bot)",
		"description": "challenge GB and FR based on bot score"
	}'
```

```json

	"result": {
		"id": "<RULESET_ID>",
		"name": "Zone Ruleset 1",
		"description": "My phase entry point ruleset at the zone level",
		"kind": "zone",

			{

			}
		],
		"last_updated": "2024-06-22T12:35:58.144683Z",
		"phase": "http_request_firewall_custom"
	},
	"success": true,
	"errors": [],
	"messages": []
}
```

## Define the rule position in the ruleset

To define the position of the new rule in the ruleset, include a `position` object in the request, containing one of the following:

* `"before": "<RULE_ID>"` — Places the rule before rule `<RULE_ID>`. Use this argument with an empty rule ID value (`""`) to set the rule as the first rule in the ruleset.
* `"after": "<RULE_ID>"` — Places the rule after rule `<RULE_ID>`. Use this argument with an empty rule ID value (`""`) to set the rule as the last rule in the ruleset.
* `"index": <POSITION_NUMBER>` — Places the rule in the exact position specified by the integer number `<POSITION_NUMBER>`. Position numbers start with `1`. Existing rules in the ruleset from the specified position number onward are shifted one position (no rule is overwritten). For example, when you place a rule in position n using `index`, existing rules with index n, n+1, n+2, and so on, are shifted one position — their new position will be n+1, n+2, n+3, and so forth. If the index is out of range, the method returns a `400` HTTP status code.

Important

You can only use one of the `before`, `after`, and `index` fields at a time.

For examples of using a `position` object, refer to [Update a rule in a ruleset](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/rulesets-api/update-rule/#examples).
