# Create a ruleset

Last updated Apr 16, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/rulesets-api/create/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Creates a ruleset of a given kind in the specified phase. Allows you to create phase entry point rulesets.

Use one of the following API endpoints:

* [Create an account ruleset](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/rulesets/methods/create/)  
`POST /accounts/{account_id}/rulesets`
* [Create a zone ruleset](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/rulesets/methods/create/)  
`POST /zones/{zone_id}/rulesets`

## Parameters

A `POST` request to create a ruleset supports the following parameters in the request body:

* `name` `String`  
  * A human-readable name for the ruleset.
  * The name is immutable. You cannot change it over the lifetime of the ruleset.
* `description` `String`Optional  
  * Optional description for the ruleset.
  * You can change the description over the lifetime of the ruleset.
* `kind` `String`  
  * The kind of ruleset the JSON object represents.
  * Allowed values:  
    * `custom`: Creates a custom ruleset
    * `root`: Creates a phase [entry point ruleset](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/about/rulesets/#entry-point-ruleset) at the account level
    * `zone`: Creates a phase entry point ruleset at the zone level
* `phase` `String`  
  * The name of the [phase](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/about/phases/) where the ruleset will be created.
  * Check the [phases list](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/reference/phases-list/) or the specific Cloudflare product documentation for more information on the phases where you can create rulesets for that product.
* `rules` `Array<Rule>`Optional  
  * A list of [rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/rulesets-api/json-object/#rule-object-structure-and-properties) to include in the ruleset.

For additional details on these parameters, refer to [JSON objects](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/rulesets-api/json-object/).

## Example - Create a custom ruleset

The following `POST` request creates a custom ruleset in the `http_request_firewall_custom` phase at the account level containing a single rule.

Required API token permissions

At least one of the following [token permissions](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/reference/permissions/) is required:
* `Mass URL Redirects Write`
* `Magic Firewall Write`
* `L4 DDoS Managed Ruleset Write`
* `Transform Rules Write`
* `Select Configuration Write`
* `Account WAF Write`
* `Account Rulesets Write`
* `Logs Write`

```bash
curl "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/$ACCOUNT_ID/rulesets" \
	--request POST \
	--header "Authorization: Bearer $CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN" \
	--json '{
		"name": "Example custom ruleset",
		"kind": "custom",
		"description": "Example ruleset description",
		"rules": [
				{
						"action": "log",
						"expression": "cf.zone.name eq \"example.com\""
				}
		],
		"phase": "http_request_firewall_custom"
	}'
```

```json
{
	"result": {
		"id": "<RULESET_ID>",
		"name": "Example custom ruleset",
		"description": "Example ruleset description",
		"kind": "custom",
		"version": "1",
		"rules": [
			{
				"id": "<RULE_ID>",
				"version": "1",
				"action": "log",
				"expression": "cf.zone.name eq \"example.com\"",
				"last_updated": "2025-03-17T15:42:37.917815Z"
			}
		],
		"last_updated": "2025-03-17T15:42:37.917815Z",
		"phase": "http_request_firewall_custom"
	},
	"success": true,
	"errors": [],
	"messages": []
}
```

## Example - Create a zone-level phase entry point ruleset

The following `POST` request creates a zone-level phase entry point ruleset at the `http_request_firewall_managed` phase with a single rule that executes a managed ruleset.

Note

You do not have to use this method to create a phase entry point ruleset. Cloudflare automatically creates the entry point ruleset when you add a rule to it, if it does not exist. Refer to [Add rules to phase entry point rulesets](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/basic-operations/add-rule-phase-rulesets/) for more information.

* `Response Compression Write`
* `Config Settings Write`
* `Dynamic URL Redirects Write`
* `Cache Settings Write`
* `Custom Errors Write`
* `Origin Write`
* `Managed headers Write`
* `Zone Transform Rules Write`
* `Mass URL Redirects Write`
* `Magic Firewall Write`
* `L4 DDoS Managed Ruleset Write`

```bash
curl "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/$ZONE_ID/rulesets" \
	--request POST \
	--header "Authorization: Bearer $CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN" \
	--json '{
		"name": "Zone-level phase entry point",
		"kind": "zone",
		"description": "This ruleset executes a managed ruleset.",
		"rules": [
				{
						"action": "execute",
						"expression": "true",
						"action_parameters": {
								"id": "<MANAGED_RULESET_ID>"
						}
				}
		],
		"phase": "http_request_firewall_managed"
	}'
```

```json
{
	"result": {
		"id": "<RULESET_ID>",
		"name": "Zone-level phase entry point",
		"description": "This ruleset executes a managed ruleset.",
		"kind": "zone",
		"version": "1",
		"rules": [
			{
				"id": "<RULE_ID>",
				"version": "1",
				"action": "execute",
				"expression": "true",
				"action_parameters": {
					"id": "<MANAGED_RULESET_ID>"
				},

	},
	"success": true,

	"messages": []
}
```

## Example - Create an account-level phase entry point ruleset

The following `POST` request creates an account-level phase entry point ruleset for the `http_ratelimit` phase with a single rule that executes a rate limiting ruleset for all Enterprise zones in the account.

Note

You do not have to use this method to create a phase entry point ruleset. Cloudflare automatically creates the entry point ruleset when you add a rule to it, if it does not exist. Refer to [Add rules to phase entry point rulesets](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/basic-operations/add-rule-phase-rulesets/) for more information.

Required API token permissions

At least one of the following [token permissions](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/reference/permissions/) is required:
* `Mass URL Redirects Write`
* `Magic Firewall Write`
* `L4 DDoS Managed Ruleset Write`
* `Transform Rules Write`
* `Select Configuration Write`
* `Account WAF Write`
* `Account Rulesets Write`
* `Logs Write`

```bash
curl "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/$ACCOUNT_ID/rulesets" \
	--request POST \
	--header "Authorization: Bearer $CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN" \
	--json '{
		"name": "Account-level phase entry point",
		"kind": "root",
		"description": "This ruleset executes a rate limiting ruleset.",
		"rules": [
				{
						"action": "execute",
						"expression": "(cf.zone.plan eq \"ENT\")",
						"action_parameters": {
								"id": "<RATE_LIMITING_RULESET_ID>"
						}
				}
		],
		"phase": "http_ratelimit"
	}'
```

```json
{
	"result": {
		"id": "<RULESET_ID>",
		"name": "Account-level phase entry point",
		"description": "This ruleset executes a rate limiting ruleset.",
		"kind": "root",
		"version": "1",
		"rules": [
			{
				"id": "<RULE_ID>",
				"version": "1",
				"action": "execute",
				"expression": "(cf.zone.plan eq \"ENT\")",
				"action_parameters": {
					"id": "<RATE_LIMITING_RULESET_ID>"
				},
				"last_updated": "2024-09-17T15:42:37.917815Z"
			}
		],
		"last_updated": "2024-09-17T15:42:37.917815Z",
		"phase": "http_ratelimit"
	},
	"success": true,
	"errors": [],
	"messages": []
}
```

Caution

You can only apply rate limiting rulesets to incoming traffic of zones on an Enterprise plan. To enforce this requirement, you must include `cf.zone.plan eq "ENT"` in the expression of the `execute` rule deploying the rate limiting ruleset.
