# Endpoints

Last updated Apr 16, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/rulesets-api/endpoints/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

For some operations, you can use specific endpoints provided by the Rulesets API for managing phase entry point rulesets. These endpoints include the phase name in the endpoint instead of the ruleset ID.

For example, instead of using the following endpoint:

```txt
PUT /zones/{zone_id}/rulesets/{ruleset_id}
```

You can use the following endpoint:

```txt
PUT /zones/{zone_id}/rulesets/phases/{phase_name}/entrypoint
```

To invoke a Rulesets API operation, append the endpoint to the Cloudflare API base URL:

```txt
https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4
```

For authentication instructions, refer to [Getting Started: Requests](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/) in the Cloudflare API documentation.

For help with endpoints and pagination, refer to [Getting Started: Endpoints](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/).

Note

The Rulesets API endpoints require a value for `{account_id}` or `{zone_id}`.

To retrieve a list of accounts you have access to, use the [List Accounts](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/accounts/methods/list/) operation. Note the IDs of the accounts you want to manage.

To retrieve a list of zones you have access to, use the [List Zones](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/zones/methods/list/) operation. Note the IDs of the zones you want to manage.

The Cloudflare Rulesets API supports the operations outlined below. Visit the associated links for API endpoints and examples.
