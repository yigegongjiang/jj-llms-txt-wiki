This page describes the JSON objects used in API requests creating or updating rulesets and their rules via Rulesets API, as well as the objects returned by the API.

## Ruleset object

A fully populated ruleset object has the following JSON structure.

```json
{
	"id": "6a359df138c442b385d20140d4d96919",
	"name": "Example Ruleset",
	"description": "Description of Example Ruleset",
	"kind": "custom",
	"version": "2",
	"phase": "http_request_firewall_custom",
	"rules": [
		{
			"id": "fdb0dd271f3f40b19679cc5d91396024",
			"version": "2",
			"action": "block",
			"expression": "cf.zone.name eq \"example.com\" ",
			"last_updated": "2022-07-20T10:44:29.124515Z"
		}
	],
	"last_updated": "2022-07-20T10:44:29.124515Z"
}
```

For details on the properties of rules items in the `rules` array, refer to the [Rule object structure and properties](#rule-object-structure-and-properties) section.

### Properties

The ruleset object has the following properties:

* `id` `String`

  * A 32-character UUIDv4 string that represents the unique Cloudflare-generated identifier for a given version of a ruleset.
  * Unique, read-only.
* `name` `String`

  * A human-readable name for the ruleset.
  * The name is immutable. You cannot change the name over the lifetime of the ruleset.
* `description` `String`

  * Optional description for the ruleset.
  * You can change the description over the lifetime of the ruleset.
* `kind` `String`

  * The kind of ruleset the JSON object represents.
  * One of `root`, `zone`, `managed`, `custom`.
  * `kind` is immutable.
* `version` `Integer`

  * The version of the ruleset.
  * Read-only value starting at `1` and incremented by `1` each time the ruleset is modified.
* `rules` `Array<Rule>`

  * A list of rules to include in the ruleset. Refer to [Rule object structure and properties](#rule-object-structure-and-properties) for details.
* `last_updated` `Timestamp`

  * The time (UTC) when the ruleset was last updated in ISO 8601 format: `YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.TZD`.
  * Read-only.

## Rule object structure and properties

A fully populated rule JSON object has the following structure:

```json
{
	"id": "fdb0dd271f3f40b19679cc5d91396024",
	"version": "2",
	"ref": "<REF>",
	"description": "<DESCRIPTION>",
	"action": "block",
	"action_parameters": [
		// action parameters vary according to the action
	],
	"categories": ["<CATEGORY_1>", "<CATEGORY_2>"],
	"expression": "cf.zone.name eq \"example.com\"",
	"last_updated": "2025-07-20T10:44:29.124515Z",
	"enabled": true
}
```

The JSON object properties for a rule are defined as follows:

* `id` `String`

  * A 32-character UUIDv4 string that represents the unique Cloudflare-generated identifier for a given version of a rule.
  * Unique, read-only.
* `version` `Integer`

  * The version of the rule.
  * Read-only value starting at `1` and incremented by `1` each time the rule is modified.
  * Changing the order of a rule in a ruleset does not change its version.
* `ref` `String`

  * A user-defined external identifier that must be unique for each rule in a ruleset.
  * Use this field in your Terraform configuration to prevent Terraform from recreating the rule on changes. Refer to [How to keep the same rule ID between modifications](https://developers.cloudflare.com/terraform/troubleshooting/rule-id-changes/#how-to-keep-the-same-rule-id-between-modifications) for more information.
* `description` `String`

  * A descriptive name of the rule.
* `action` `String`

  * Defines what happens when there is a match for the rule expression.
  * The available [actions](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/rules-language/actions/) depend on the [phase](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/about/phases/) where the rule's ruleset is executed.
* `action_parameters` `Object`

  * One or more parameters configuring the rule action.
  * The exact properties vary according to the action. Refer to each Cloudflare product's API instructions for more information.
* `categories` `Array<String>`

  * Tags associated with the current rule. You can define overrides that affect rules with a given tag.
  * Read-only. Only available in [WAF Managed Rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/managed-rules/) and [DDoS managed rulesets](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ddos-protection/managed-rulesets/).
* `expression` `String`

  * Criteria defining when there is a match for the current rule.
  * The fields and functions you can use in a rule expression depend on the phase where the rule's ruleset is executed.
* `last_updated` `Timestamp`

  * The time (UTC) when the rule was last updated in ISO 8601 format: `YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.TZD`.
  * Read-only.
* `enabled` `Boolean`

  * When set to `true`, the current rule is enabled.
