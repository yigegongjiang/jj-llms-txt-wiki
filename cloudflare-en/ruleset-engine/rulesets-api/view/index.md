# List and view rulesets

Last updated Apr 16, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/rulesets-api/view/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Use the API operations described in the following sections to list and view the details of rulesets at the account or zone level.

* [List existing rulesets](#list-existing-rulesets)
* [View a specific ruleset](#view-a-specific-ruleset)
* [List all versions of a ruleset](#list-all-versions-of-a-ruleset)
* [View a specific version of a ruleset](#view-a-specific-version-of-a-ruleset)
* [List rules in a managed ruleset with a specific tag](#list-rules-in-a-managed-ruleset-with-a-specific-tag)

## List existing rulesets

Returns the list of existing rulesets at the account level or at the zone level.

Use one of the following API endpoints:

* [List account rulesets](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/rulesets/methods/list/)  
`GET /accounts/{account_id}/rulesets`
* [List zone rulesets](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/rulesets/methods/list/)  
`GET /zones/{zone_id}/rulesets`

The result includes rulesets across all phases at a given level (account or zone). The `phase` field in each result element indicates the [phase](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/about/phases/) where that ruleset is defined.

Also, the list of rulesets at the zone level includes the account-level rulesets you may want to deploy to the specified zone.

Note

Not all zone-level phases support all types of rulesets, even if they are presented in the list returned by this API method. Check the documentation for each Cloudflare product for more information on which ruleset types are allowed in that product's supported phases.

The result does not include the list of rules in the ruleset. Refer to [View a specific version of a ruleset](#view-a-specific-version-of-a-ruleset) to learn how to obtain the list of rules.

## View a specific ruleset

Returns the properties of the most recent version of the ruleset with the specified ruleset ID.

Use one of the following API endpoints:

* [Get an account ruleset](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/rulesets/methods/get/)  
`GET /accounts/{account_id}/rulesets/{ruleset_id}`
* [Get an account entry point ruleset](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/rulesets/subresources/phases/methods/get/)  
`GET /accounts/{account_id}/rulesets/phases/{phase_name}/entrypoint`
* [Get a zone ruleset](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/rulesets/methods/get/)  
`GET /zones/{zone_id}/rulesets/{ruleset_id}`
* [Get a zone entry point ruleset](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/rulesets/subresources/phases/methods/get/)  
`GET /zones/{zone_id}/rulesets/phases/{phase_name}/entrypoint`

Note

You can only use the [Get a zone ruleset](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/rulesets/methods/get/) operation for zone-level phase entry point rulesets (entry points where `kind` is set to `zone`).

The API returns a `404 Not Found` HTTP status code under these conditions:

* When a ruleset cannot be found.
* When the specified ruleset is not a managed ruleset the calling account is entitled to execute.

Returns a list of all the versions of a ruleset.

Use one of the following API endpoints:

* [List account ruleset versions](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/rulesets/subresources/versions/methods/list/)  
`GET /accounts/{account_id}/rulesets/{ruleset_id}/versions`
* [List account entry point ruleset versions](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/rulesets/subresources/phases/subresources/versions/methods/list/)  
`GET /accounts/{account_id}/rulesets/phases/{phase_name}/entrypoint/versions`
* [List zone ruleset versions](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/rulesets/subresources/versions/methods/list/)  
`GET /zones/{zone_id}/rulesets/{ruleset_id}/versions`

`GET /zones/{zone_id}/rulesets/phases/{phase_name}/entrypoint/versions`

The result contains the ruleset properties of each version, but it does not include the list of rules. Refer to [View a specific version of a ruleset](#view-a-specific-version-of-a-ruleset) for instructions on obtaining this information.

When the specified phase entry point ruleset does not exist, this API method returns an empty array in the `result` field.
