# Work with custom rulesets

Last updated Apr 16, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/custom-rulesets/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Use the following workflow to deploy a custom ruleset:

1. [Create a custom ruleset](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/custom-rulesets/create-custom-ruleset/), optionally providing a list of rules to include in the custom ruleset.
2. (Optional) [Add rules to your custom ruleset](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/custom-rulesets/add-rules-ruleset/).
3. [Deploy the custom ruleset](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/custom-rulesets/deploy-custom-ruleset/) by adding an `execute` rule to a phase entry point ruleset. If you skip this step, the rules of the custom ruleset will not run.

Currently, custom rulesets are only supported by the [Cloudflare WAF](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/), both at the account and the zone level.

Note

You cannot execute a custom ruleset from another custom ruleset, only from an [entry point ruleset](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/about/rulesets/#entry-point-ruleset).

## Change the behavior of a custom ruleset

To modify custom ruleset behavior, Cloudflare recommends [creating a new custom ruleset](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/custom-rulesets/create-custom-ruleset/) or [editing the custom ruleset](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/custom-rulesets/add-rules-ruleset/) instead of using overrides.
