# Deploy a custom ruleset

Last updated Apr 16, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/custom-rulesets/deploy-custom-ruleset/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

To deploy a custom ruleset, add a rule with `execute` action to the list of rules of a phase [entry point ruleset](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/about/rulesets/#entry-point-ruleset) at the account or zone level. The expression of the new rule will define when the custom ruleset will run.

You can only deploy custom rulesets in an entry point ruleset with the same scope. For example, a custom ruleset defined at the account level can only be deployed at the account level.

If you are using Terraform, refer to [WAF custom rules configuration using Terraform](https://developers.cloudflare.com/terraform/additional-configurations/waf-custom-rules/#create-and-deploy-a-custom-ruleset) for examples of creating and deploying custom rulesets.

If you are using the Cloudflare dashboard, refer to [Work with custom rulesets in the dashboard](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/account/custom-rulesets/create-dashboard/).

Note

Currently, zone-level custom rulesets are only available in the [http\_request\_firewall\_custom](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/custom-rules/custom-rulesets/#deploy-a-custom-ruleset-via-api) phase.

## Before you begin

1. Obtain the name of the [phase](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/reference/phases-list/) where you want to deploy the custom ruleset.
2. [Create a custom ruleset](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/custom-rulesets/create-custom-ruleset/) and keep the ID of the new custom ruleset.
3. [Fetch the rules already present in the phase entry point ruleset](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/basic-operations/view-rulesets/#view-the-rules-included-in-a-ruleset). You must include in the `PUT` request all existing rules you want to keep.

## Example A - Account-level deployment

The following `PUT` request adds a rule that executes a custom ruleset when the zone name matches `example.com`.

In the `PUT` request, you must include the IDs of all existing rules you want to keep. The response will include all the rules in the phase entry point ruleset after the update.

Required API token permissions

At least one of the following [token permissions](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/reference/permissions/) is required:
* `Mass URL Redirects Write`
* `Magic Firewall Write`
* `L4 DDoS Managed Ruleset Write`
* `Transform Rules Write`
* `Select Configuration Write`
* `Account WAF Write`
* `Account Rulesets Write`
* `Logs Write`

```bash
curl "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/$ACCOUNT_ID/rulesets/phases/http_request_firewall_custom/entrypoint" \
	--request PUT \
	--header "Authorization: Bearer $CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN" \
	--json '{
		"rules": [
				{
						"action": "execute",
						"description": "Execute custom ruleset",
						"expression": "(cf.zone.name == \"example.com\") and cf.zone.plan eq \"ENT\"",

		]
	}'
```

		],

		"phase": "http_request_firewall_custom"
	},
	"success": true,
	"errors": [],
	"messages": []
}
```

Caution

When deploying the custom ruleset at the account level, you must use parentheses to enclose any custom conditions and end your expression with `and cf.zone.plan eq "ENT"` like in the example above, or else the API operation will fail.

## Example B - Zone-level deployment

The following `PUT` request adds a rule to a zone-level entry point ruleset that executes a custom ruleset with ID `"<CUSTOM_RULESET_ID>"` for requests targeting the `/login` URI path.

You must include in the `PUT` request the IDs of all existing rules you want to keep. The response will include all the rules in the phase entry point ruleset after the update.
