# Create a custom ruleset

Last updated Apr 16, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/custom-rulesets/create-custom-ruleset/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Use the [Create an account or zone ruleset](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/rulesets/methods/create/) operation to create a custom ruleset, making sure that you:

* Set the `kind` field to `custom`.
* Specify the name of the [phase](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/reference/phases-list/) where you want to create the custom ruleset in the `phase` field.

You can also specify the list of rules to include in the custom ruleset in the `rules` array. To add rules after creating the custom ruleset, refer to [Add rules to a custom ruleset](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/custom-rulesets/add-rules-ruleset/).

If you are using Terraform, refer to [WAF custom rules configuration using Terraform](https://developers.cloudflare.com/terraform/additional-configurations/waf-custom-rules/#create-and-deploy-a-custom-ruleset) for examples of creating and deploying custom rulesets.

If you are using the Cloudflare dashboard, refer to [Work with custom rulesets in the dashboard](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/account/custom-rulesets/create-dashboard/).

Note

Currently, zone-level custom rulesets are only available in the [http\_request\_firewall\_custom](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/custom-rules/custom-rulesets/#deploy-a-custom-ruleset-via-api) phase.

## Example A - Custom ruleset at the account level

The following request creates a new custom ruleset at the account level. The response will include the ID of the new custom ruleset in the `id` field.

Required API token permissions

At least one of the following [token permissions](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/reference/permissions/) is required:
* `Mass URL Redirects Write`
* `Magic Firewall Write`
* `L4 DDoS Managed Ruleset Write`
* `Transform Rules Write`
* `Select Configuration Write`
* `Account WAF Write`
* `Account Rulesets Write`
* `Logs Write`

```bash
curl "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/$ACCOUNT_ID/rulesets" \
	--request POST \
	--header "Authorization: Bearer $CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN" \
	--json '{
		"name": "Custom Ruleset 1",
