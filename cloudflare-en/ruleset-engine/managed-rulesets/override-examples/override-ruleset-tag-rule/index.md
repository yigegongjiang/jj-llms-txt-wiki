# Deploy a managed ruleset with ruleset, tag, and rule overrides

Last updated Apr 16, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/managed-rulesets/override-examples/override-ruleset-tag-rule/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Customize the execution of managed rulesets with a combination of ruleset overrides, tag overrides, and rule overrides in your phase entry point ruleset.

1. [Add a rule](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/basic-operations/deploy-rulesets/) to a phase entry point ruleset to execute a managed ruleset.
2. [Configure a ruleset override](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/managed-rulesets/override-managed-ruleset/) that disables all rules in the managed ruleset.
3. [Configure a tag override](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/managed-rulesets/override-managed-ruleset/) that sets an action for rules with a given tag.
4. [Configure a rule override](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/managed-rulesets/override-managed-ruleset/) that sets an action for the rules you want to execute.

## Zone-level example

This example uses the [Update a zone entry point ruleset](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/rulesets-api/update/) operation to execute the following in a single `PUT` request:

* Add a rule to the `http_request_firewall_managed` phase entry point ruleset that executes a managed ruleset.
* Use category overrides to enable rules with `wordpress` and `drupal` tags and set their actions to `log`.
* Add a rule override that enables a single rule.

In this example:

* `"id": "<MANAGED_RULESET_ID>"` defines the managed ruleset to execute for requests addressed to a zone (`$ZONE_ID`).
* `"enabled": false` defines an override at the ruleset level to disable all rules in the managed ruleset.
* `"categories": [{"category": "wordpress", "action": "log", "enabled": true}, {"category": "drupal", "action": "log", "enabled": true}]` defines an override at the tag level to enable rules tagged with `wordpress` or `drupal` and sets their action to `log`.
* `"rules": [{"id": "<RULE_ID>", "action": "block", "enabled": true}]` defines an override at the rule level that enables one individual rule and sets the action to `block`.

Required API token permissions

At least one of the following [token permissions](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/reference/permissions/) is required:
* `Response Compression Write`
* `Config Settings Write`
* `Dynamic URL Redirects Write`
* `Cache Settings Write`
* `Custom Errors Write`
* `Origin Write`
* `Managed headers Write`
* `Zone Transform Rules Write`
* `Mass URL Redirects Write`
* `Magic Firewall Write`
* `L4 DDoS Managed Ruleset Write`
* `HTTP DDoS Managed Ruleset Write`
* `Sanitize Write`
* `Transform Rules Write`
* `Select Configuration Write`
* `Bot Management Write`
* `Zone WAF Write`
* `Account WAF Write`
* `Account Rulesets Write`
* `Logs Write`
* `Logs Write`

```bash
curl "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/$ZONE_ID/rulesets/phases/http_request_firewall_managed/entrypoint" \
	--request PUT \
	--header "Authorization: Bearer $CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN" \
	--json '{
		"rules": [
				{
						"action": "execute",
						"expression": "true",
						"action_parameters": {
								"id": "<MANAGED_RULESET_ID>",
								"overrides": {
										"enabled": false,
										"categories": [
												{
														"category": "wordpress",
														"action": "log",
														"enabled": true
												},
												{
														"category": "drupal",
														"action": "log",
														"enabled": true
												}
										],
										"rules": [
												{
														"id": "<RULE_ID>",
														"action": "block",
														"enabled": true
												}
										]
								}
						}
				}
		]
	}'
```

## Account-level example

This example uses the [Update an account entry point ruleset](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/rulesets-api/update/) operation to execute the following in a single `PUT` request:

* Add a rule to the `http_request_firewall_managed` phase entry point ruleset that executes a managed ruleset for the zone `example.com`.
* Use category overrides to enable rules with `wordpress` and `drupal` tags and set their actions to `log`.
* Add a rule override that enables a single rule.

In this example:

* `"id": "<MANAGED_RULESET_ID>"` defines the managed ruleset to execute for requests addressed to `example.com`.
* `"enabled": false` defines an override at the ruleset level to disable all rules in the managed ruleset.
* `"categories": [{"category": "wordpress", "action": "log", "enabled": true}, {"category": "drupal", "action": "log", "enabled": true}]` defines an override at the tag level to enable rules tagged with `wordpress` or `drupal` and sets their action to `log`.
* `"rules": [{"id": "<RULE_ID>", "action": "block", "enabled": true}]` defines an override at the rule level that enables one individual rule and sets the action to `block`.

Note

At the account level, the rule expression of an `execute` rule must end with `and cf.zone.plan eq "ENT"` so that it only applies to zones on an Enterprise plan.

	--json '{
		"rules": [

						"action": "execute",
						"expression": "cf.zone.name eq \"example.com\" and cf.zone.plan eq \"ENT\"",
						"action_parameters": {
								"id": "<MANAGED_RULESET_ID>",
