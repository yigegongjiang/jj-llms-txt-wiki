# Set WordPress rules to Block

Last updated May 5, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/managed-rulesets/override-examples/deploy-cmr-wordpress-block/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Follow the steps below to create a rule that executes a managed ruleset and defines an override for rules with a specific tag.

1. [Add a rule](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/basic-operations/deploy-rulesets/) to a phase entry point ruleset that executes a managed ruleset.
2. [Configure a tag override](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/managed-rulesets/override-managed-ruleset/) that sets a specified action for all rules with a given tag.

## Zone-level example

This example uses the [Update a zone entry point ruleset](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/rulesets-api/update/) operation to perform the following two steps in a single `PUT` request:

* Set the list of rules in the `http_request_firewall_managed` phase entry point ruleset to a single rule that executes the [Cloudflare Managed Ruleset](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/managed-rules/reference/cloudflare-managed-ruleset/).
* Override rules with the `wordpress` tag to set the action to `block`. All other rules use the default action provided by the ruleset issuer.

Required API token permissions

At least one of the following [token permissions](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/reference/permissions/) is required:
* `Response Compression Write`
* `Config Settings Write`
* `Dynamic URL Redirects Write`
* `Cache Settings Write`
* `Custom Errors Write`
* `Origin Write`
* `Managed headers Write`
* `Zone Transform Rules Write`
* `Mass URL Redirects Write`
* `Magic Firewall Write`
* `L4 DDoS Managed Ruleset Write`
* `HTTP DDoS Managed Ruleset Write`
* `Sanitize Write`
* `Transform Rules Write`
* `Select Configuration Write`
* `Bot Management Write`
* `Zone WAF Write`
* `Account WAF Write`
* `Account Rulesets Write`
* `Logs Write`
* `Logs Write`

```bash
curl "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/$ZONE_ID/rulesets/phases/http_request_firewall_managed/entrypoint" \
	--request PUT \
	--header "Authorization: Bearer $CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN" \
	--json '{
		"rules": [
				{
						"action": "execute",
						"expression": "true",
						"action_parameters": {
								"id": "<MANAGED_RULESET_ID>",
								"overrides": {
										"categories": [
												{
														"category": "wordpress",
														"action": "block"
												}
										]
								}
						}
				}
		]
	}'
```

## Account-level example

This example uses the [Update an account entry point ruleset](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/rulesets-api/update/) operation to perform the following two steps in a single `PUT` request:

* Set the list of rules in the `http_request_firewall_managed` phase entry point ruleset to a single rule that executes the [Cloudflare Managed Ruleset](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/managed-rules/reference/cloudflare-managed-ruleset/) for the zone `example.com`.
* Override rules with the `wordpress` tag to set the action to `block`. All other rules use the default action provided by the ruleset issuer.

Note

At the account level, the rule expression of an `execute` rule must end with `and cf.zone.plan eq "ENT"` so that it only applies to zones on an Enterprise plan.

Required API token permissions

At least one of the following [token permissions](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/reference/permissions/) is required:
* `Mass URL Redirects Write`
* `Magic Firewall Write`
* `L4 DDoS Managed Ruleset Write`
* `Transform Rules Write`
* `Select Configuration Write`
* `Account WAF Write`
* `Account Rulesets Write`
* `Logs Write`

```bash
curl "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/$ACCOUNT_ID/rulesets/phases/http_request_firewall_managed/entrypoint" \
	--request PUT \
	--header "Authorization: Bearer $CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN" \
	--json '{
		"rules": [
				{
						"action": "execute",
						"expression": "cf.zone.name eq \"example.com\" and cf.zone.plan eq \"ENT\"",
						"action_parameters": {
								"id": "<MANAGED_RULESET_ID>",
								"overrides": {
										"categories": [
												{
														"category": "wordpress",
														"action": "block"
												}
										]
								}
						}
				}
		]
	}'
```
