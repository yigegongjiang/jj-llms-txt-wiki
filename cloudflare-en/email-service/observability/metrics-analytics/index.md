# Metrics and analytics

Last updated Jun 9, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/email-service/observability/metrics-analytics/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Email Service exposes analytics that allow you to inspect email sending performance and delivery rates across all your domains.

The metrics displayed in the [Cloudflare dashboard ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) charts are queried from Cloudflare's [GraphQL Analytics API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/analytics/graphql-api/). You can access the metrics [programmatically](#query-via-the-graphql-api) via GraphQL or HTTP client.

## Metrics

Email Service currently exposes the below metrics:

| Dataset              | GraphQL Dataset Name       | Description                                                                                                                  |
| -------------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Sending (aggregated) | emailSendingAdaptiveGroups | Aggregated email sending counts grouped by dimensions such as status, date, sending domain, and authentication results.      |
| Sending (events)     | emailSendingAdaptive       | Individual email sending events with full detail including sender, recipient, subject, message ID, and error information.    |
| Routing (aggregated) | emailRoutingAdaptiveGroups | Aggregated email routing counts grouped by dimensions such as status, date, recipient domain, and authentication results.    |
| Routing (events)     | emailRoutingAdaptive       | Individual email routing events with full detail including sender, recipient, subject, message ID, and processing decisions. |

Metrics can be queried (and are retained) for the past 31 days.

## View metrics in the dashboard

Per-domain analytics for Email Service are available in the Cloudflare dashboard. To view current and historical metrics:

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) and select your account.
2. Go to **Compute** \> **Email Service** and select **Email Sending** or **Email Routing**.
3. Select an existing domain or view account-wide metrics.
4. Select the **Analytics** tab.

You can optionally select a time window to query. This defaults to the last 24 hours.

## Query via the GraphQL API

You can programmatically query analytics for your Email Service domains via the [GraphQL Analytics API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/analytics/graphql-api/). This API queries the same datasets as the Cloudflare dashboard, and supports GraphQL [introspection](https://developers.cloudflare.com/analytics/graphql-api/features/discovery/introspection/).

To get started using the [GraphQL Analytics API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/analytics/graphql-api/), follow the documentation to setup [Authentication for the GraphQL Analytics API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/analytics/graphql-api/getting-started/authentication/). Your API token must include the **Analytics Read** permission.

These are **zone-level** datasets. To query them, provide your zone ID (not account ID) as the `zoneTag` filter. The GraphQL datasets for Email Service include:

* `emailSendingAdaptiveGroups` — aggregated email sending counts with groupable dimensions
* `emailSendingAdaptive` — individual email sending events
* `emailRoutingAdaptiveGroups` — aggregated email routing counts with groupable dimensions
* `emailRoutingAdaptive` — individual email routing events

### Email Sending dimensions

The `emailSendingAdaptiveGroups` dataset supports the following dimensions for grouping and filtering:

| Dimension              | Type   | Description                                              |

### Examples

The following are common GraphQL queries that you can use to retrieve information about Email Service analytics. These queries use the variable `$zoneTag`, which should be set to your Cloudflare Zone ID. You can find this in the Cloudflare dashboard under your domain's **Overview** page.

```json
{
	"zoneTag": "<YOUR_ZONE_ID>",
	"start": "2024-07-15",
	"end": "2024-07-30"
}
```

#### Email sending operations

To query the count of emails for a given date range, grouped by `date` and `status` (for example, `delivered`, `deliveryFailed`):

```graphql
query EmailSendingByStatus($zoneTag: string!, $start: Date!, $end: Date!) {
	viewer {
		zones(filter: { zoneTag: $zoneTag }) {
			emailSendingAdaptiveGroups(
				filter: { date_geq: $start, date_leq: $end }
				limit: 10000
				orderBy: [date_DESC]
			) {
				count
				dimensions {
					date
					status
				}
			}
		}
	}
}
```

#### Delivery failure analysis

To investigate delivery failure causes for a specific date range, grouped by `errorCause` and `sendingDomain`:

```graphql
query EmailDeliveryFailures($zoneTag: string!, $start: Date!, $end: Date!) {
	viewer {
		zones(filter: { zoneTag: $zoneTag }) {
			emailSendingAdaptiveGroups(
				filter: { date_geq: $start, date_leq: $end, status: "deliveryFailed" }
				limit: 10000
				orderBy: [date_DESC]
			) {
				count
				dimensions {
					date
					errorCause
					sendingDomain
				}
			}
		}
	}
}
```

#### Hourly volume

To query email sending volume grouped by hour, useful for identifying traffic patterns:

```graphql
query EmailSendingHourlyVolume($zoneTag: string!, $start: Time!, $end: Time!) {
	viewer {
		zones(filter: { zoneTag: $zoneTag }) {
			emailSendingAdaptiveGroups(
				filter: { datetimeHour_geq: $start, datetimeHour_leq: $end }
				limit: 10000
				orderBy: [datetimeHour_ASC]
			) {
				count
				dimensions {
					datetimeHour
					status
				}
			}
		}
	}
}
```

#### Individual email events

To query individual email events for troubleshooting specific delivery issues. This uses the `emailSendingAdaptive` dataset and filters by `datetime` (Time type):

```graphql
query RecentEmailEvents($zoneTag: string!, $start: Time!, $end: Time!) {
	viewer {
		zones(filter: { zoneTag: $zoneTag }) {
			emailSendingAdaptive(
				filter: { datetime_geq: $start, datetime_leq: $end }
				limit: 50
				orderBy: [datetime_DESC]
			) {
				datetime
				from
				to
				subject
				status
				eventType
				sendingDomain
				messageId
				errorCause
				errorDetail
				dkim
				dmarc
				spf
				isSpam
			}
		}
	}
}
```

#### Email routing operations

To query the count of routed emails for a given date range, grouped by `date` and `status`:

```graphql
query EmailRoutingByStatus($zoneTag: string!, $start: Date!, $end: Date!) {
	viewer {
		zones(filter: { zoneTag: $zoneTag }) {
			emailRoutingAdaptiveGroups(
				filter: { date_geq: $start, date_leq: $end }
				limit: 10000
				orderBy: [date_DESC]
			) {
				count
				dimensions {
					date
					status
				}
			}
		}
	}
}
```

#### Routing rule activity

To see which routing rules are matching emails, grouped by `ruleMatched` and `action`:

```graphql
query EmailRoutingRuleActivity($zoneTag: string!, $start: Date!, $end: Date!) {
	viewer {
		zones(filter: { zoneTag: $zoneTag }) {
			emailRoutingAdaptiveGroups(
				filter: { date_geq: $start, date_leq: $end }
				limit: 10000
				orderBy: [date_DESC]
			) {
				count
				dimensions {
					date
					ruleMatched
					action
				}
			}
		}
	}
}
```

#### Individual routing events

To query individual routing events for troubleshooting:

```graphql
query RecentRoutingEvents($zoneTag: string!, $start: Time!, $end: Time!) {
	viewer {
		zones(filter: { zoneTag: $zoneTag }) {
			emailRoutingAdaptive(
				filter: { datetime_geq: $start, datetime_leq: $end }
				limit: 50
				orderBy: [datetime_DESC]
			) {
				datetime
				from
				to
				subject
				status
				action
				ruleMatched
				messageId
				errorDetail
				dkim
				dmarc
				spf
				isSpam
			}
		}
	}
}
```

Note

The `*AdaptiveGroups` datasets use `Date` type filters (`date_geq`, `date_leq`) for day-level filtering, or `Time` type filters (`datetimeHour_geq`, etc.) for finer granularity. The `*Adaptive` (events) datasets use `Time` type filters (`datetime_geq`, `datetime_leq`), for example `"2024-07-15T00:00:00Z"`.
