# Cloudflare Email Service

Last updated Jun 9, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/email-service/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Send transactional emails and route incoming emails to Workers or email addresses

Cloudflare Email Service provides powerful email capabilities:

* **Email Sending** Beta for outbound transactional emails  
Available on Workers Paid plan
* **Email Routing** for handling incoming emails with Workers or routing to email addresses  
Available on Free and Paid plans

Note

Sending to [verified destination addresses](https://developers.cloudflare.com/email-service/configuration/email-routing-addresses/#destination-addresses) in your account is free on all plans, even when only Email Routing is configured.

Together, these two features make it possible for you to send and receive emails from your applications. For example, you can use Email Service for:

* Transactional emails (welcome messages, password resets, order confirmations)
* Authentication flows (magic links, email verification, two-factor authentication)
* Notifications and alerts
* Custom email addresses (support@, contact@, orders@)
* Emails as a mode of interaction for agents, such as send an email to create an issue in ticket tracking

Access Email Service directly from Cloudflare Workers using [bindings](https://developers.cloudflare.com/email-service/api/send-emails/workers-api/), from any platform using the [REST API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/email-service/api/send-emails/rest-api/), or over [authenticated SMTP](https://developers.cloudflare.com/email-service/api/send-emails/smtp/):

Send emails with the `EMAIL` binding and handle incoming emails with the `email()` handler in `src/index.ts`:

```ts
interface Env {
	EMAIL: SendEmail;
}

export default {
	// Handle HTTP requests (Email Sending)
	async fetch(request, env, ctx): Promise<Response> {
		// Send a welcome email
		await env.EMAIL.send({
			to: "user@example.com",
			from: "welcome@yourdomain.com",
			subject: "Welcome to our service!",
			html: "<h1>Welcome!</h1><p>Thanks for signing up.</p>",
			text: "Welcome! Thanks for signing up.",
		});

		return new Response("Email sent successfully");
	},

	// Handle incoming emails (Email Routing)
	async email(message, env, ctx): Promise<void> {
		// Forward to support team
		if (message.to.includes("support@yourdomain.com")) {
			await message.forward("team@yourdomain.com");
		}

		// Send auto-reply
		await env.EMAIL.send({
			to: message.from,
			from: "noreply@yourdomain.com",
			subject: "We received your message",
			html: "<h1>Thank you!</h1><p>We'll get back to you soon.</p>",
		});
	},
} satisfies ExportedHandler<Env>;
```

Add the bindings to your Wrangler configuration file:

```jsonc
{
	"$schema": "node_modules/wrangler/config-schema.json",
	"name": "<ENTER_WORKER_NAME>",
	"main": "src/index.ts",
	"compatibility_date": "$today",

	// Email sending
	"send_email": [
		{
			"name": "EMAIL"
		}
	],

	// Email routing
	"email": [
		{
			"name": "EMAIL_HANDLER"
		}
	]
}
```

```bash
curl "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/{account_id}/email/sending/send" \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer <API_TOKEN>" \
  --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{
    "to": "user@example.com",
    "from": "welcome@yourdomain.com",
    "subject": "Welcome to our service!",
    "html": "<h1>Welcome!</h1><p>Thanks for signing up.</p>",
    "text": "Welcome! Thanks for signing up."
  }'
```

Cloudflare also provides official SDKs for the REST API: [Node](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/node/), [Python](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/python/), and [Go](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/go/).

```sh
cat > mail.txt <<EOF
From: welcome@yourdomain.com
To: user@example.com
Subject: Welcome to our service!

Thanks for signing up.
EOF

curl --ssl-reqd \
  --url "smtps://smtp.mx.cloudflare.net:465" \
  --user "api_token:<API_TOKEN>" \
  --mail-from "welcome@yourdomain.com" \
  --mail-rcpt "user@example.com" \
  --upload-file mail.txt
```
