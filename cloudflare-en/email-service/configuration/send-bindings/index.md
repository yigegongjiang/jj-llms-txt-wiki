# Configure send bindings

Last updated Jun 9, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/email-service/configuration/send-bindings/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

When you add a `send_email` binding to a Worker, you can restrict which addresses it may send from and to. Configure these restrictions in your Wrangler configuration file. For the binding API itself, refer to the [Workers API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/email-service/api/send-emails/workers-api/).

## Binding types

Each entry in `send_email` can be configured to restrict what the binding can do. The sender address must always belong to a domain you have onboarded to Email Service.

* **No restriction attribute**: The binding can send to any verified destination address in your account.
* **`destination_address`**: The binding can only send to the single destination address configured here. If you call `send()` with `to` set to `null` or `undefined`, the configured address is used.
* **`allowed_destination_addresses`**: The binding can only send to addresses listed in this allowlist.
* **`allowed_sender_addresses`**: The binding can only send from the addresses listed in this allowlist.

```jsonc
{
	"send_email": [
		// Send to any verified destination
		{ "name": "EMAIL" },
		// Send only to a single fixed destination
		{
			"name": "NOTIFY_OPS",
			"destination_address": "ops@yourdomain.com",
		},
		// Send only to addresses on an allowlist
		{
			"name": "EMAIL_TEAM",
			"allowed_destination_addresses": [
				"alice@yourdomain.com",
				"bob@yourdomain.com",
			],
		},
		// Send only from addresses on an allowlist
		{
			"name": "RESTRICTED_EMAIL",
			"allowed_sender_addresses": [
				"noreply@yourdomain.com",
				"support@yourdomain.com",
			],
		},
	],
}
```

```toml
[[send_email]]
name = "EMAIL"

[[send_email]]
name = "NOTIFY_OPS"
destination_address = "ops@yourdomain.com"

[[send_email]]
name = "EMAIL_TEAM"
allowed_destination_addresses = [ "alice@yourdomain.com", "bob@yourdomain.com" ]

[[send_email]]
name = "RESTRICTED_EMAIL"
allowed_sender_addresses = [ "noreply@yourdomain.com", "support@yourdomain.com" ]
```

## Next steps

* [Workers API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/email-service/api/send-emails/workers-api/) — send emails from a Worker using the binding.
* [Domain configuration](https://developers.cloudflare.com/email-service/configuration/domains/) — onboard the domains you send from.
