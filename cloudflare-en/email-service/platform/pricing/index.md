# Pricing

Last updated Jun 9, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/email-service/platform/pricing/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Cloudflare Email Service pricing is based on your Cloudflare plan and email usage.

## Plan pricing

Email Routing is available on both the Workers Free and Workers Paid plans. Sending to arbitrary recipients requires the Workers Paid plan. Sending to [verified destination addresses](https://developers.cloudflare.com/email-service/configuration/email-routing-addresses/#destination-addresses) in your account is free on all plans, including when only Email Routing is configured.

|                                     | Workers Free  | Workers Paid                                          |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Outbound emails (Email Sending)** | Not available | 3,000 included per month, then $0.35 per 1,000 emails |
| **Inbound emails (Email Routing)**  | Unlimited     | Unlimited                                             |

The 3,000 included emails apply per account, per month, aligned with your Cloudflare subscription billing cycle. Emails that hard-bounce or are otherwise accepted by Email Service count toward the quota. Emails rejected at the API boundary, including sends blocked by the [suppression list](https://developers.cloudflare.com/email-service/concepts/suppressions/), do not count toward the quota.

Sends to verified destination addresses are free and do not count toward the included quota.

Email Routing Workers is billed according to [Workers pricing](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/pricing/).
