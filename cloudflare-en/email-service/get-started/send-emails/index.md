# Send emails

Send your first email using the Workers binding, the REST API, or SMTP.

Last updated Jun 25, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/email-service/get-started/send-emails/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Send emails from your applications using Cloudflare Email Service. You can use the **Workers binding** for applications built on Cloudflare Workers, the **REST API** from any platform, or **SMTP** from any SMTP-capable application or mail client.

Note

You must be using Cloudflare DNS to use Email Service.

## Set up your domain

Before using Email Sending, configure your domain.

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to **Compute** \> **Email Service** \> **Email Sending**.  
[Go to **Email Sending** ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/email-service/sending)
2. Select **Onboard Domain**.
3. Choose a domain from your Cloudflare account. Optionally review the DNS records that Cloudflare will add to the `cf-bounce` subdomain of your domain:

  * MX records to route bounce emails to Cloudflare.
  * TXT record for SPF to authorize sending emails.
  * TXT record for DKIM to provide authentication for emails sent from your domain.
  * TXT record for DMARC on `_dmarc.yourdomain.com`.
4. Select **Done**.

Note

DNS changes can take up to 24 hours to propagate globally, but usually complete within 5-15 minutes for domains using Cloudflare DNS.

Once your domain is onboarded, you can start sending emails.

## Send your first email

You can send your first email using the Workers binding, the REST API, or SMTP.

If you are building on Cloudflare Workers, you can use the Workers binding for native email sending. Start by creating a new Worker project.

1. Create a new Worker project:  
npmyarnpnpm  
```  
npm create cloudflare@latest -- email-service-tutorial  
```  
```  
yarn create cloudflare email-service-tutorial  
```  
```  
pnpm create cloudflare@latest email-service-tutorial  
```  
When prompted, select **"Hello World" Worker** as the template.
2. Add the email binding to your Wrangler configuration file:  
```jsonc  
{  
	"send_email": [  
		{  
			"name": "EMAIL",  
			"remote": true,  
		},  
	],  
}  
```  
```toml  
[[send_email]]  
name = "EMAIL"  
remote = true  
```
3. Create your Worker code in `src/index.ts`:  
```ts  
// Configuration - Update these values  
const YOUR_DOMAIN = "yourdomain.com"; // Replace with your verified domain  
const RECIPIENT_EMAIL = "recipient@example.com"; // Replace with your email to receive test emails  
export default {  
	async fetch(request: Request, env: Env): Promise<Response> {  
		// Send a welcome email  
		const response = await env.EMAIL.send({  
			to: RECIPIENT_EMAIL,  
			from: `welcome@${YOUR_DOMAIN}`,  
			subject: "Welcome to our service!",  
			html: "<h1>Welcome!</h1><p>Thanks for signing up.</p>",  
			text: "Welcome! Thanks for signing up.",  
		});  
		return new Response(`Email sent: ${response.messageId}`);  
	},  
} satisfies ExportedHandler<Env>;  
```
4. Use `npx wrangler dev` to develop your Worker project and send emails. This runs your code locally while connecting to Cloudflare Email Service (using [remote bindings](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/local-development/#remote-bindings)).  
```sh  
npx wrangler dev  
# ⎔ Starting remote preview...  
# Total Upload: 24.96 KiB / gzip: 6.17 KiB  
# [wrangler:info] Ready on http://localhost:8787  
```
5. Deploy your Worker:  
```sh  
npm run deploy  
```

After deploying, test that your Worker can send emails:

1. Visit your Worker URL in a browser (shown in the deploy output, for example: `https://email-service-tutorial.<your-subdomain>.workers.dev`).
2. You should see a response like `Email sent: <message-id>`.
3. Check the inbox for the email address you specified in `RECIPIENT_EMAIL`. If you do not see the email, check your spam folder.

Send an email with a single `curl` command. Replace `{account_id}` with your [Cloudflare account ID](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/account/find-account-and-zone-ids/) and `<API_TOKEN>` with an [API token](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/get-started/create-token/).

```bash
curl "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/{account_id}/email/sending/send" \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer <API_TOKEN>" \
  --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{
    "to": "recipient@example.com",
    "from": "welcome@yourdomain.com",
    "subject": "Welcome to our service!",
    "html": "<h1>Welcome!</h1><p>Thanks for signing up.</p>",
    "text": "Welcome! Thanks for signing up."
  }'
```

A successful response includes the delivery status for each recipient:

```json
{
	"success": true,
	"errors": [],
	"messages": [],
	"result": {
		"delivered": ["recipient@example.com"],
		"permanent_bounces": [],
		"queued": []
	}
}
```

For more details, see the [REST API reference](https://developers.cloudflare.com/email-service/api/send-emails/rest-api/).

Send an email with a single `curl` command. Replace `<API_TOKEN>` with a [Cloudflare API token](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/get-started/create-token/) that has the **Email Sending: Edit** permission, and replace the `--mail-from` and `--mail-rcpt` addresses with your own.

```sh
cat > mail.txt <<EOF
From: welcome@yourdomain.com
To: recipient@example.com
Subject: Welcome to our service!

Thanks for signing up.
EOF

curl --ssl-reqd \
  --url "smtps://smtp.mx.cloudflare.net:465" \
  --user "api_token:<API_TOKEN>" \
  --mail-from "welcome@yourdomain.com" \
  --mail-rcpt "recipient@example.com" \
  --upload-file mail.txt
```

The sender domain (`welcome@yourdomain.com`) must be onboarded for [Email Sending](https://developers.cloudflare.com/email-service/configuration/domains/) on the account that owns the API token.

For connection details, authentication, response codes, and language-specific examples, see the [SMTP reference](https://developers.cloudflare.com/email-service/api/send-emails/smtp/).
