# SMTP

Last updated Jun 9, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/email-service/api/send-emails/smtp/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Cloudflare Email Service exposes an authenticated SMTP submission endpoint so you can send emails from any application, framework, or off-the-shelf mail client that speaks SMTP. Use SMTP when the [REST API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/email-service/api/send-emails/rest-api/) and the [Workers binding](https://developers.cloudflare.com/email-service/api/send-emails/workers-api/) are not a good fit — for example, when integrating an existing application that already speaks SMTP, or a language-native SMTP library (Nodemailer, `smtplib`, PHPMailer, JavaMail).

Emails submitted over SMTP enter the same delivery pipeline as the REST API and the Workers binding: they are subject to the same [limits](https://developers.cloudflare.com/email-service/platform/limits/), receive the same DKIM and ARC signing, and produce the same delivery logs.

## Endpoint

```txt
smtp.mx.cloudflare.net:465
```

| Setting   | Value                              |
| --------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Host      | smtp.mx.cloudflare.net             |
| Port      | 465                                |
| Security  | Implicit TLS (also called SMTPS)   |
| SMTP AUTH | PLAIN or LOGIN                     |
| Username  | The literal string api\_token      |
| Password  | A Cloudflare API token (see below) |

Cloudflare only offers SMTP submission on port `465` with implicit TLS. Plaintext SMTP, opportunistic `STARTTLS` on port `587`, and unauthenticated relay on port `25` are not supported for outbound submission. Port `25` is reserved for inbound mail to [Email Routing](https://developers.cloudflare.com/email-service/api/route-emails/).

## Prerequisites

Before you can send emails over SMTP, you need:

1. An account with [Email Sending](https://developers.cloudflare.com/email-service/) enabled.
2. At least one [domain onboarded](https://developers.cloudflare.com/email-service/configuration/domains/) under **Email Service > Email Sending** in the Cloudflare dashboard.
3. A [Cloudflare API token](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/get-started/create-token/) with the **Email Sending: Edit** permission. Both account-owned (recommended) and user-owned tokens are accepted; the token is used as the SMTP password.

Treat this token as a credential. Anyone with it can send email from any onboarded domain on the matching account.

## Quickstart

Send an email with a single `curl` command. Replace `<API_TOKEN>` with a [Cloudflare API token](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/get-started/create-token/) that has the **Email Sending: Edit** permission, and replace the `--mail-from` and `--mail-rcpt` addresses with your own.

```sh
cat > mail.txt <<EOF
From: welcome@yourdomain.com
To: recipient@example.com
Subject: Welcome to our service!

Thanks for signing up.
EOF

curl --ssl-reqd \
  --url "smtps://smtp.mx.cloudflare.net:465" \
  --user "api_token:<API_TOKEN>" \
  --mail-from "welcome@yourdomain.com" \
  --mail-rcpt "recipient@example.com" \
  --upload-file mail.txt
```

The sender domain (`welcome@yourdomain.com`) must be onboarded for [Email Sending](https://developers.cloudflare.com/email-service/configuration/domains/) on the account that owns the API token.

## Authentication

Cloudflare's SMTP endpoint supports two SASL mechanisms, both defined by [RFC 4954 ↗](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4954):

* `AUTH PLAIN` — preferred. Single round trip, [RFC 4616 ↗](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4616).
* `AUTH LOGIN` — legacy [draft-murchison-sasl-login ↗](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-murchison-sasl-login-00). Supported for compatibility with older clients.

In both cases, the username is the literal string `api_token` and the password is your Cloudflare API token.

### Construct an `AUTH PLAIN` payload

`AUTH PLAIN` sends `\0api_token\0<API_TOKEN>` encoded as base64:

```sh
printf '\0api_token\0%s' "<API_TOKEN>" | base64
```

### Raw SMTP transcript

The following transcript shows a complete authenticated submission using `openssl s_client`. Lines beginning with `>` are sent by the client.

```txt
$ openssl s_client -quiet -connect smtp.mx.cloudflare.net:465 -crlf
220 mx.cloudflare.net Cloudflare Email ESMTP Service ready
> EHLO client.example.com
250-mx.cloudflare.net greets client.example.com
250-AUTH PLAIN LOGIN
250-SIZE 5242880
250-8BITMIME
250 ENHANCEDSTATUSCODES
> AUTH PLAIN AGFwaV90b2tlbgBpd0RQLi5oZWw=
235 2.7.0 Authentication successful
> MAIL FROM:<welcome@yourdomain.com>
250 2.1.0 Ok
> RCPT TO:<recipient@example.com>
250 2.1.5 Ok
> DATA
354 Start mail input; end with <CR><LF>.<CR><LF>
From: welcome@yourdomain.com
To: recipient@example.com
Subject: Welcome

Thanks for signing up.
.
250 2.0.0 Ok <jZTWt0pQO4p2LG7ByfkeSYUvT62k85Q12nCA@yourdomain.com>
> QUIT
221 mx.cloudflare.net Cloudflare Email ESMTP Service closing transmission channel
```

The `250 2.0.0 Ok` response after the message body includes the assigned Message-ID. Use it to correlate the submission with delivery logs in the dashboard.

## Examples

For language-specific examples — curl, Nodemailer, Python `smtplib`, and PHPMailer — see [Send email over SMTP](https://developers.cloudflare.com/email-service/examples/email-sending/smtp/).

## Limits

The following per-session limits apply to SMTP submission:

| Limit                   | Value          |
| ----------------------- | -------------- |
| RCPT TO recipients      | 50 per session |
| SIZE advertised in EHLO | 5 MiB          |
| AUTH command timeout    | 30 seconds     |
| DATA command timeout    | 300 seconds    |

Account-wide quotas (daily sending limits, content limits, header limits) are shared with the REST API and the Workers binding. See [Limits](https://developers.cloudflare.com/email-service/platform/limits/) for the full list.

## Response codes

Cloudflare's SMTP server returns standard [RFC 5321 ↗](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5321) reply codes alongside [RFC 3463 ↗](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3463) enhanced status codes.

| Code      | Meaning                                                                 |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 220       | Service ready (greeting after the TLS handshake).                       |
| 235 2.7.0 | Authentication succeeded.                                               |
| 250       | EHLO, MAIL FROM, RCPT TO, or DATA completed successfully.               |
| 354       | Ready to receive the message body — terminate with <CR><LF>.<CR><LF>.   |
| 421       | Service temporarily unavailable. Retry later.                           |
| 451 4.3.0 | Local error — the message was accepted but deferred. Retry later.       |
| 452 4.5.3 | Too many recipients in this session. Open a new session for the rest.   |
| 500 / 501 | Syntax error in command or arguments.                                   |
| 503       | Bad sequence of commands (for example, MAIL FROM before AUTH).          |
| 530 5.7.0 | Authentication required.                                                |
| 535 5.7.8 | Authentication failed. See [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting).         |
| 550 5.7.1 | Sender or relay denied — usually the MAIL FROM domain is not onboarded. |
| 552 5.3.4 | Message exceeds the 5 MiB SIZE limit.                                   |
| 554       | Transaction failed — content rejected by policy.                        |

## Troubleshooting

### `535 5.7.8 Authentication failed`

Possible causes:

* The username is not the literal string `api_token`. The API token goes in the **password** field.
* The token does not have the **Email Sending: Edit** permission.
* The token has been revoked or has expired.
* For a user-owned token, the domain in `MAIL FROM` does not belong to an account the token can act on.

### `550 5.7.1 Sender denied`

The address in `MAIL FROM` is on a domain that is not onboarded for Email Sending under the account that owns the API token. Onboard the domain under **Email Service > Email Sending** in the dashboard, or change the sender address.

### `552 5.3.4 Message too big`

The message body (including attachments after MIME encoding) is larger than 5 MiB. Reduce the attachment size or split the message.

### TLS handshake failures

Cloudflare's SMTP endpoint requires TLS from connect (implicit TLS). Make sure your client is configured for SSL/TLS on port `465`, not `STARTTLS` on port `587` (which is not supported).
