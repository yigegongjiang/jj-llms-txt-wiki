# Available Notifications

Last updated Apr 24, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/notifications/notification-available/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Available Notifications depend on your Cloudflare plan. Cloudflare offers a variety of Notifications for our products and services, such as [Billing](https://developers.cloudflare.com/billing/), [Denial of Service protection](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ddos-protection/), [Magic Transit](https://developers.cloudflare.com/magic-transit/), and [SSL/TLS](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/).

Depending on your plan, you can also configure webhooks, allowing you to connect your account with external services such as Slack and Google Chat, and PagerDuty to receive Cloudflare Notifications.

## Actions available on receiving a Notification

Each Notification carries different types of information about the status of your Cloudflare account, or the type of action you can take.

Refer to information below to understand what each Notification does and what to do when receiving one.

## Billing

Usage Based Billing

**Who is it for?**

Customers who want to receive a notification when the usage of a product goes above a set level.

**Other options / filters**

You can choose the product that you want to be notified about and the threshold that fires the notification. Thresholds depend on the product chosen.

For example:

* Argo Smart Routing has **Notify when total bytes of traffic exceeds** as a threshold.
* Load Balancing has **Notify when total number of DNS Queries exceeds** as a threshold.
**Included with**

Professional plans or higher.

**Note:** Usage-based billing notifications are available to Pay-as-you-go accounts only. Most Enterprise contract accounts are not supported.

**What should you do if you receive one?**

Review your product usage and adjust the configuration and/or increase the alerting threshold.

## Bots

Bot Detection Alert

**Who is it for?**

Enterprise customers who want to be notified when Cloudflare detects a spike in bot traffic on their zones.

**Other options / filters**

None.

**Included with**

Accounts with at least one Enterprise zone.

**What should you do if you receive one?**

Select the [Security Analytics](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/analytics/security-analytics/) link enclosed in the alert message. Contact support if additional advice is needed on how to investigate the attack further.

**Additional information**

After an alert is created on the dashboard, it may take up to 30 minutes before sufficient data is available to begin detecting traffic anomalies. Verified bot traffic is excluded from bot alerts.

Custom Bot Detection Alert

**Who is it for?**

Enterprise customers who want to be notified when Cloudflare detects a spike in bot traffic on their zones.

**Other options / filters**

Refer to the [alert logic](https://developers.cloudflare.com/bots/reference/alerts/#alert-logic) for more information on additional filters or groupings.

**Included with**

Accounts with at least one Enterprise zone.

**What should you do if you receive one?**

Select the [Security Analytics](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/analytics/security-analytics/) link enclosed in the alert message. Contact support if additional advice is needed on how to investigate the attack further.

**Additional information**

After an alert is created on the dashboard, it may take up to 30 minutes before sufficient data is available to begin detecting traffic anomalies. Verified bot traffic is excluded from both basic and advanced bot alerts.

Alerts with grouping could cause potential noise if you set them up for a high-traffic zone. Grouping alerts function as if you set up separate policies with a filter for each value. Alerts may trigger multiple values in the same group as long as the traffic for each value reaches the threshold of 200.
