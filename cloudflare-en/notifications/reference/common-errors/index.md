# Common errors

Last updated Apr 24, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/notifications/reference/common-errors/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Refer to the information below for more details on common notification errors and how to troubleshoot them.

## Webhook test failed with status code 400 400 Bad Request

This error can occur when you try to configure a webhook that is not currently supported, such as setting up a PagerDuty webhook.

PagerDuty needs to be configured under [connected notification services](https://developers.cloudflare.com/notifications/get-started/configure-pagerduty/).

## Deleted users are still receiving notifications

When you remove a user from your account via **Manage Account** \> **Members** in the Cloudflare dashboard, their email address is not removed from existing notifications.

You need to remove the email address from the configuration of the notifications by [editing the notification recipient](https://developers.cloudflare.com/notifications/get-started/#edit-a-notification).
