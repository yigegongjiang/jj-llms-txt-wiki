# WAF fields

Last updated Apr 23, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/reference/waf-fields/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

The Web Application Firewall (WAF) contains rules managed by Cloudflare to block requests that contain malicious content.

## WAF Action

| Value | Action          | Description                                  |
| ----- | --------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| 0     | Unknown         | Take no other action.                        |
| 1     | Allow           | Bypass all subsequent WAF rules.             |
| 2     | Drop            | Block with an HTTP 403 response.             |
| 3     | Challenge Allow | Issue a Managed Challenge.                   |
| 4     | Challenge Drop  | Unused.                                      |
| 5     | Log             | Take no action other than logging the event. |
