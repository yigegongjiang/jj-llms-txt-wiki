# Enable Google Cloud Storage

Last updated Apr 23, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/logpush/logpush-job/enable-destinations/google-cloud-storage/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Cloudflare Logpush supports pushing logs directly to Google Cloud Storage (GCS) via the Cloudflare dashboard or via API.

## Manage via the Cloudflare dashboard

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Logpush** page at the account or or domain (also known as zone) level.  
For account: [Go to **Logpush** ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/logs)  
For domain (also known as zone): [Go to **Logpush** ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/:zone/analytics/logs)
2. Depending on your choice, you have access to [account-scoped datasets](https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/logpush/logpush-job/datasets/account/) and [zone-scoped datasets](https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/logpush/logpush-job/datasets/zone/), respectively.
3. Select **Create a Logpush job**.
1. In **Select a destination**, choose **Google Cloud Storage**.
2. Enter or select the following destination details:

  * **Bucket** \- GCS bucket name
  * **Path** \- bucket location within the storage container
  * **Organize logs into daily subfolders** (recommended)
  * For **Grant Cloudflare access to upload files to your bucket**, make sure your bucket has added Cloudflare’s IAM as a user with a [Storage Object Admin role ↗](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control/iam-roles).

When you are done entering the destination details, select **Continue**.

1. To prove ownership, Cloudflare will send a file to your designated destination. To find the token, select the **Open** button in the **Overview** tab of the ownership challenge file, then paste it into the Cloudflare dashboard to verify your access to the bucket. Enter the **Ownership Token** and select **Continue**.
2. Select the dataset to push to the storage service.
3. In the next step, you need to configure your logpush job:

  * Enter the **Job name**.
  * Under **If logs match**, you can select the events to include and/or remove from your logs. Refer to [Filters](https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/logpush/logpush-job/filters/) for more information. Not all datasets have this option available.
  * In **Send the following fields**, you can choose to either push all logs to your storage destination or selectively choose which logs you want to push.
4. In **Advanced Options**, you can:

  * Choose the format of timestamp fields in your logs (`RFC3339` (default), `Unix`, or `UnixNano`).
  * Select a [sampling rate](https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/logpush/logpush-job/api-configuration/#sampling-rate) for your logs or push a randomly-sampled percentage of logs.
  * Enable redaction for `CVE-2021-44228`. This option will replace every occurrence of `${` with `x{`.
5. Select **Submit** once you are done configuring your logpush job.

## Create and get access to a GCS bucket

Cloudflare uses Google Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM) to gain access to your bucket. The Cloudflare IAM service account needs admin permission for the bucket.

Ensure **Log Share** permissions are enabled, before attempting to read or configure a Logpush job. For more information refer to the [Roles section](https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/logpush/permissions/#roles).

  
To enable Logpush to GCS:

1. Create a GCS bucket. Refer to [instructions from GCS ↗](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/creating-buckets#storage-create-bucket-console).
2. In **Storage** \> **Browser** \> **Bucket** \> **Permissions**, add the member `logpush@cloudflare-data.iam.gserviceaccount.com` with `Storage Object Admin` permission.

## Compression and decompressive transcoding

Logpush always delivers log files in gzip-compressed format. When uploading to GCS, Logpush sets `Content-Encoding: gzip` on the object metadata.

GCS performs [decompressive transcoding ↗](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/transcoding) by default. This means that when a client downloads an object stored with `Content-Encoding: gzip`, GCS may automatically decompress the file in transit if the client does not include `Accept-Encoding: gzip` in the request headers. When this happens, the downloaded file contains uncompressed data even though the filename retains the `.gz` extension.

To download log files in their original compressed format, use one of the following approaches:

* **Include `Accept-Encoding: gzip` in your download request headers.** For example, when using gsutil:  
```sh  
gsutil -h "Accept-Encoding: gzip" cp gs://your-bucket/path/file.log.gz .  
```
