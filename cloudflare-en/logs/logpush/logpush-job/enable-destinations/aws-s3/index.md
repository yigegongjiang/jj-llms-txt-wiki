# Enable Amazon S3

Last updated Apr 23, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/logpush/logpush-job/enable-destinations/aws-s3/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Cloudflare Logpush supports pushing logs directly to Amazon S3 via the Cloudflare dashboard or via API. Customers that use AWS GovCloud locations should use our **S3-compatible endpoint** and not the **Amazon S3 endpoint**.

## Manage via the Cloudflare dashboard

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Logpush** page at the account or or domain (also known as zone) level.  
For account: [Go to **Logpush** ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/logs)  
For domain (also known as zone): [Go to **Logpush** ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/:zone/analytics/logs)
2. Depending on your choice, you have access to [account-scoped datasets](https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/logpush/logpush-job/datasets/account/) and [zone-scoped datasets](https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/logpush/logpush-job/datasets/zone/), respectively.
3. Select **Create a Logpush job**.
1. In **Select a destination**, choose **Amazon S3**.
2. Enter or select the following destination information:

  * **Bucket** \- S3 bucket name
  * **Path** \- bucket location within the storage container
  * **Organize logs into daily subfolders** (recommended)
  * **Bucket region**
  * If your policy requires [AWS SSE-S3 AES256 Server Side Encryption ↗](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/serv-side-encryption.html).
  * For **Grant Cloudflare access to upload files to your bucket**, make sure your bucket has a [policy ↗](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/example-policies-s3.html#iam-policy-ex0) (if you did not add it already):  
    * Copy the JSON policy, then go to your bucket in the Amazon S3 console and paste the policy in **Permissions** \> **Bucket Policy** and select **Save**.

When you are done entering the destination details, select **Continue**.

1. To prove ownership, Cloudflare will send a file to your designated destination. To find the token, select the **Open** button in the **Overview** tab of the ownership challenge file, then paste it into the Cloudflare dashboard to verify your access to the bucket. Enter the **Ownership Token** and select **Continue**.
2. Select the dataset to push to the storage service.
3. In the next step, you need to configure your logpush job:

  * Enter the **Job name**.
  * Under **If logs match**, you can select the events to include and/or remove from your logs. Refer to [Filters](https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/logpush/logpush-job/filters/) for more information. Not all datasets have this option available.
  * In **Send the following fields**, you can choose to either push all logs to your storage destination or selectively choose which logs you want to push.
4. In **Advanced Options**, you can:

  * Choose the format of timestamp fields in your logs (`RFC3339` (default), `Unix`, or `UnixNano`).
  * Select a [sampling rate](https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/logpush/logpush-job/api-configuration/#sampling-rate) for your logs or push a randomly-sampled percentage of logs.
  * Enable redaction for `CVE-2021-44228`. This option will replace every occurrence of `${` with `x{`.
5. Select **Submit** once you are done configuring your logpush job.

## Create and get access to an S3 bucket

Cloudflare uses Amazon Identity and Access Management (IAM) to gain access to your S3 bucket. The Cloudflare IAM user needs `PutObject` permission for the bucket.

Logs are written into that bucket as gzipped objects using the S3 Access Control List (ACL) `Bucket-owner-full-control` permission.

For illustrative purposes, imagine that you want to store logs in the bucket `burritobot`, in the `logs` directory. The S3 URL would then be `s3://burritobot/logs`.

Ensure **Log Share** permissions are enabled, before attempting to read or configure a Logpush job. For more information refer to the [Roles section](https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/logpush/permissions/#roles).

  
To enable Logpush to Amazon S3:

1. Create an S3 bucket. Refer to [instructions from Amazon ↗](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/gsg/CreatingABucket.html).  
Note  
Buckets in China regions (`cn-north-1`, `cn-northwest-1`) are currently not supported.
2. Edit and paste the policy below into **S3** \> **Bucket** \> **Permissions** \> **Bucket Policy**, replacing the `Resource` value with your own bucket path. The `AWS` `Principal` is owned by Cloudflare and should not be changed.

```json
{
	"Id": "<POLICY_ID>",
	"Version": "2012-10-17",
	"Statement": [
		{
			"Sid": "Stmt1506627150918",
			"Action": ["s3:PutObject"],
			"Effect": "Allow",
			"Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::burritobot/logs/*",
			"Principal": {
				"AWS": ["arn:aws:iam::391854517948:user/cloudflare-logpush"]
			}
		}
	]
}
```

Note

Logpush uses multipart upload for S3\. Aborted uploads will result in incomplete files remaining in your bucket. To minimize your storage costs, Amazon recommends configuring a lifecycle rule using the `AbortIncompleteMultipartUpload` action. Refer to [Uploading and copying objects using multipart upload ↗](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpuoverview.html#mpu-abort-incomplete-mpu-lifecycle-config).
