Network session logs are generated for all traffic proxied through Cloudflare Gateway across all supported [on-ramps](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectivity-options/), such as the Cloudflare One Client (WARP), proxy endpoints (PAC files), Browser Isolation, and Cloudflare Tunnel.
