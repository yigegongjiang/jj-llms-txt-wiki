# Filters

Last updated Jun 30, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/logpush/logpush-job/filters/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

The following table represents the comparison operators that are supported and example values. Filters are added as escaped JSON strings formatted as `{"key":"<field>","operator":"<comparison_operator>","value":"<value>"}`.

* Refer to the [Datasets](https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/logpush/logpush-job/datasets/) page for a list of fields related to each dataset.
* Comparison operators define how values must relate to fields in the log line for an expression to return true.
* Values represent the data associated with fields.

The filter field has limits of approximately 30 operators and 1000 bytes. Anything exceeding this value will return an error.

Note

Filtering is not supported on the following data types: `objects`, `array[object]`.

For the Firewall events dataset, the following fields are not supported: `Action`, `Description`, `Kind`, `MatchIndex`, `Metadata`, `OriginatorRayID`, `RuleID`, and `Source`.

## Logical Operators

* Filters can be connected using `AND`, `OR` logical operators.
* Logical operators can be nested.

Here are some examples of how the logical operators can be implemented. `X`, `Y` and `Z` are used to represent filter criteria:

* X AND Y AND Z - `{"where":{"and":[{X},{Y},{Z}]}}`
* X OR Y OR Z - `{"where":{"or":[{X},{Y},{Z}]}}`
* X AND (Y OR Z) - `{"where":{"and":[{X}, {"or":[{Y},{Z}]}]}}`
* (X AND Y) OR Z - `{"where":{"or":[{"and": [{X},{Y}]},{Z}]}}`

Logpush filters act as a pass-through gate, not an exclusion list. When multiple conditions are joined with AND:

* All conditions must evaluate to TRUE for the log to be pushed.
* If any single condition is FALSE, the log is excluded.

A common misconception is interpreting the filter as `exclude logs matching ALL conditions` rather than `include logs matching ALL conditions`.

## Set filters via API or dashboard

Filters can be set via API or the Cloudflare dashboard. Note that using a filter is optional, but if used, it must contain the `where` key.

### API

Here is an example request using cURL via API:

Required API token permissions

At least one of the following [token permissions](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/reference/permissions/) is required:
* `Logs Write`

```bash
curl "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/$ZONE_ID/logpush/jobs" \
	--request POST \
	--header "Authorization: Bearer $CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN" \
	--json '{
		"name": "static-assets",
		"output_options": {
				"field_names": [
						"ClientIP",
						"EdgeStartTimestamp",
						"RayID"
				],
				"sample_rate": 0.1,
				"timestamp_format": "rfc3339",
				"CVE-2021-44228": true
		},
		"dataset": "http_requests",
		"filter": "{\"where\":{\"and\":[{\"key\":\"ClientRequestPath\",\"operator\":\"contains\",\"value\":\"/static\"},{\"key\":\"ClientRequestHost\",\"operator\":\"eq\",\"value\":\"example.com\"}]}}",
		"destination_conf": "s3://<BUCKET_PATH>?region=us-west-2/"
	}'
```

### Dashboard

To set filters through the dashboard:

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Logpush** page at the account or or domain (also known as zone) level.  
For account: [Go to **Logpush** ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/logs)  
For domain (also known as zone): [Go to **Logpush** ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/:zone/analytics/logs)
2. Select the dataset you want to push to a storage service. Depending on your choice, you have access to [account-scoped datasets](https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/logpush/logpush-job/datasets/account/) and [zone-scoped datasets](https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/logpush/logpush-job/datasets/zone/), respectively.
3. Below **Select data fields**, in the **Filter** section, you can set up your filters.
4. You need to select a [dataset field](https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/logpush/logpush-job/datasets/), an [Operator](https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/logpush/logpush-job/filters/#logical-operators), and a **Value**.
5. You can connect more filters using `AND` and `OR` logical operators.
6. Select **Next** to continue the setting up of your Logpush job.
