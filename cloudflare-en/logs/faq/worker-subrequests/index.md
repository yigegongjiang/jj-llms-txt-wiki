### Why are the origin fields empty on the initial request when a Worker makes a subrequest?

When a request hits a zone with a Worker, the initial HTTP request log represents the end-user request to the Worker. If that Worker later makes a `fetch()` request to your origin, Cloudflare writes a second HTTP request log for that Worker subrequest.

Because the initial log entry only covers the request from the client to the Worker, `OriginResponseStatus` is `0` and `OriginIP` is empty on that entry. Those fields are populated on the second log entry, which represents the Worker-to-origin fetch. For more on what `OriginResponseStatus=0` means in different contexts, refer to [504 responses with origin status 0 in Logpush](https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/faq/504-origin-status-0/).

### What the two log entries represent

| Log entry         | Typical ClientRequestSource value | What it represents                   | Origin fields                                |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| Initial request   | eyeball                           | End-user request to the Worker       | OriginResponseStatus is 0, OriginIP is empty |
| Worker subrequest | edgeWorkerFetch                   | Worker fetch() request to the origin | Set when the origin is contacted             |

Refer to [ClientRequestSource field](https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/reference/clientrequestsource/) for the full list of possible `ClientRequestSource` values.

### How the two entries are linked

Each log entry has its own `RayID`. The Worker subrequest also includes `ParentRayID`, which is the `RayID` of the request that triggered it — its immediate parent.

| Field       | Initial request                            | Worker subrequest                      |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| RayID       | Unique request ID for the end-user request | Unique request ID for the subrequest   |
| ParentRayID | Empty                                      | RayID of the request that triggered it |

To correlate the two records:

1. Find the initial request and note its `RayID`.
2. Search for log entries where `ParentRayID` equals that `RayID`.
3. Review the matching subrequest log entry for `OriginIP`, `OriginResponseStatus`, and other origin fields.

One end-user request can produce multiple Worker subrequest log entries. Each subrequest gets its own `RayID`, and each of those log entries uses the triggering request's `RayID` as its `ParentRayID`.

`ParentRayID` is single-level — it points to the immediate parent, not the original end-user request. In a single-Worker setup this distinction does not matter because the parent is the end-user request. When Workers are chained (for example, Worker A calls Worker B which calls the origin), Worker B's subrequest log has Worker A's `RayID` as its `ParentRayID`, not the end-user's. To trace the full chain back to the end-user request, follow each `ParentRayID` one level at a time.

Using the initial request together with the matching subrequest entries lets you reconstruct the full request path from client to Worker to origin.

### Example

```txt
# Initial request
ClientRequestSource: eyeball
RayID: 7b52f2c4f9f64c1a
ParentRayID:
OriginResponseStatus: 0

# Worker subrequest
ClientRequestSource: edgeWorkerFetch
RayID: 7b52f2c4f9f64c1b
ParentRayID: 7b52f2c4f9f64c1a
OriginResponseStatus: 200
OriginIP: 192.0.2.10
```

### When there is no second log entry

If the Worker does not make a `fetch()` request to the origin, there is no Worker-to-origin log entry to correlate. For example, the Worker may return a response directly without contacting the origin.

### Recommended fields to include in Logpush

To investigate Worker subrequests more easily, include these fields in your HTTP request logs:

* `RayID`
* `ParentRayID`
* `ClientRequestSource`
* `OriginIP`
* `OriginResponseStatus`
