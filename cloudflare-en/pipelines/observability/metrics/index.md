# Metrics and analytics

Last updated Apr 21, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pipelines/observability/metrics/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Pipelines expose metrics which allow you to measure data ingested, processed, and delivered to sinks.

The metrics displayed in the [Cloudflare dashboard ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) are queried from Cloudflare's [GraphQL Analytics API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/analytics/graphql-api/). You can access the metrics [programmatically](#query-via-the-graphql-api) via GraphQL or HTTP client.

## Metrics

### Operator metrics

Pipelines export the below metrics within the `pipelinesOperatorAdaptiveGroups` dataset. These metrics track data read and processed by pipeline operators.

| Metric        | GraphQL Field Name | Description                                                                                              |
| ------------- | ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Bytes In      | bytesIn            | Total number of bytes read by the pipeline (filter by streamId\_neq: "" to get data read from streams)   |
| Records In    | recordsIn          | Total number of records read by the pipeline (filter by streamId\_neq: "" to get data read from streams) |
| Decode Errors | decodeErrors       | Number of messages that could not be deserialized in the stream schema                                   |

For a detailed breakdown of why events were dropped (including specific error types like `missing_field`, `type_mismatch`, `parse_failure`, and `null_value`), refer to [User error metrics](#user-error-metrics).

The `pipelinesOperatorAdaptiveGroups` dataset provides the following dimensions for filtering and grouping queries:

* `pipelineId` \- ID of the pipeline
* `streamId` \- ID of the source stream
* `datetime` \- Timestamp of the operation
* `date` \- Timestamp of the operation, truncated to the start of a day
* `datetimeHour` \- Timestamp of the operation, truncated to the start of an hour

### Sink metrics

Pipelines export the below metrics within the `pipelinesSinkAdaptiveGroups` dataset. These metrics track data delivery to sinks.

| Metric                     | GraphQL Field Name       | Description                                                  |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Bytes Written              | bytesWritten             | Total number of bytes written to the sink, after compression |
| Records Written            | recordsWritten           | Total number of records written to the sink                  |
| Files Written              | filesWritten             | Number of files written to the sink                          |
| Row Groups Written         | rowGroupsWritten         | Number of row groups written (for Parquet files)             |
| Uncompressed Bytes Written | uncompressedBytesWritten | Total number of bytes written before compression             |

The `pipelinesSinkAdaptiveGroups` dataset provides the following dimensions for filtering and grouping queries:

* `pipelineId` \- ID of the pipeline
* `sinkId` \- ID of the destination sink
* `datetime` \- Timestamp of the operation
* `date` \- Timestamp of the operation, truncated to the start of a day
* `datetimeHour` \- Timestamp of the operation, truncated to the start of an hour

### User error metrics

Pipelines track events that are dropped during processing due to deserialization errors. When a structured stream receives events that do not match its defined schema, those events are accepted during ingestion but dropped during processing. The `pipelinesUserErrorsAdaptiveGroups` dataset provides visibility into these dropped events, telling you which events were dropped and why. You can explore the full schema of this dataset using GraphQL [introspection](https://developers.cloudflare.com/analytics/graphql-api/features/discovery/introspection/).

| Metric | GraphQL Field Name | Description                             |
| ------ | ------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| Count  | count              | Number of events that failed validation |

The `pipelinesUserErrorsAdaptiveGroups` dataset provides the following dimensions for filtering and grouping queries:

* `pipelineId` \- ID of the pipeline
* `errorFamily` \- Category of the error (for example, `deserialization`)
* `errorType` \- Specific error type within the family
* `date` \- Date of the error, truncated to start of day
* `datetime` \- Timestamp of the error
* `datetimeHour` \- Timestamp of the error, truncated to the start of an hour
* `datetimeMinute` \- Timestamp of the error, truncated to the start of a minute

#### Known error types

| Error family    | Error type     | Description                                                                                                  |
| --------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| deserialization | missing\_field | A required field defined in the stream schema was not present in the event                                   |
| deserialization | type\_mismatch | A field value did not match the expected type in the schema (for example, string sent where number expected) |
| deserialization | parse\_failure | The event could not be parsed as valid JSON, or a field value could not be parsed into the expected type     |
| deserialization | null\_value    | A required field was present but had a null value                                                            |

Note

To prevent incorrect data from being ingested in the first place, consider using [typed pipeline bindings](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pipelines/streams/writing-to-streams/#typed-pipeline-bindings) to catch schema violations at compile time.

## View metrics and errors in the dashboard

Per-pipeline analytics are available in the Cloudflare dashboard. To view current and historical metrics for a pipeline:

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com) and select your account.
2. Go to **Pipelines** \> **Pipelines**.
3. Select a pipeline.
4. Go to the **Metrics** tab to view its metrics or **Errors** tab to view dropped events.

You can optionally select a time window to query. This defaults to the last 24 hours.

## Query via the GraphQL API

You can programmatically query analytics for your pipelines via the [GraphQL Analytics API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/analytics/graphql-api/). This API queries the same datasets as the Cloudflare dashboard and supports GraphQL [introspection](https://developers.cloudflare.com/analytics/graphql-api/features/discovery/introspection/).

Pipelines GraphQL datasets require an `accountTag` filter with your Cloudflare account ID.

### Measure operator metrics over time period

This query returns the total bytes and records read by a pipeline from streams, along with any decode errors.

```graphql
query PipelineOperatorMetrics(
	$accountTag: String!
	$pipelineId: String!
	$datetimeStart: Time!
	$datetimeEnd: Time!
) {
	viewer {
		accounts(filter: { accountTag: $accountTag }) {
			pipelinesOperatorAdaptiveGroups(
				limit: 10000
				filter: {
					pipelineId: $pipelineId
					streamId_neq: ""
					datetime_geq: $datetimeStart
					datetime_leq: $datetimeEnd
				}
			) {
				sum {
					bytesIn
					recordsIn
					decodeErrors
				}
			}
		}
	}
}
```

### Measure sink delivery metrics

This query returns detailed metrics about data written to a specific sink, including file and compression statistics.

```graphql
query PipelineSinkMetrics(
	$accountTag: String!
	$pipelineId: String!
	$sinkId: String!
	$datetimeStart: Time!
	$datetimeEnd: Time!
) {
	viewer {
		accounts(filter: { accountTag: $accountTag }) {
			pipelinesSinkAdaptiveGroups(
				limit: 10000
				filter: {
					pipelineId: $pipelineId
					sinkId: $sinkId
					datetime_geq: $datetimeStart
					datetime_leq: $datetimeEnd
				}
			) {
				sum {
					bytesWritten
					recordsWritten
					filesWritten
					rowGroupsWritten
					uncompressedBytesWritten
				}
			}
		}
	}
}
```

### Query dropped event errors

This query returns a summary of events that were dropped due to schema validation failures, grouped by error type and ordered by frequency.

```graphql
query GetPipelineUserErrors(
	$accountTag: String!
	$pipelineId: String!
	$datetimeStart: Time!
	$datetimeEnd: Time!
) {
	viewer {
		accounts(filter: { accountTag: $accountTag }) {
			pipelinesUserErrorsAdaptiveGroups(
				limit: 100
				filter: {
					pipelineId: $pipelineId
					datetime_geq: $datetimeStart
					datetime_leq: $datetimeEnd
				}
				orderBy: [count_DESC]
			) {
				count
				dimensions {
					date
					errorFamily
					errorType
				}
			}
		}
	}
}
```

Example response:

```json
{
	"data": {
		"viewer": {
			"accounts": [
				{
					"pipelinesUserErrorsAdaptiveGroups": [
						{
							"count": 679,
							"dimensions": {
								"date": "2026-02-19",
								"errorFamily": "deserialization",
								"errorType": "missing_field"
							}
						},
						{
							"count": 392,
							"dimensions": {
								"date": "2026-02-19",
								"errorFamily": "deserialization",
								"errorType": "type_mismatch"
							}
						},
						{
							"count": 363,
							"dimensions": {
								"date": "2026-02-19",
								"errorFamily": "deserialization",
								"errorType": "parse_failure"
							}
						},
						{
							"count": 44,
							"dimensions": {
								"date": "2026-02-19",
								"errorFamily": "deserialization",
								"errorType": "null_value"
							}
						}
					]
				}
			]
		}
	},
	"errors": null
}
```

You can filter by a specific error type by adding `errorType` to the filter:

```graphql
pipelinesUserErrorsAdaptiveGroups(
	limit: 100
	filter: {
		pipelineId: $pipelineId
		datetime_geq: $datetimeStart
		datetime_leq: $datetimeEnd
		errorType: "type_mismatch"
	}
	orderBy: [count_DESC]
)
```

To query errors across all pipelines on an account, omit the `pipelineId` filter and include `pipelineId` in the dimensions:

```graphql
pipelinesUserErrorsAdaptiveGroups(
	limit: 100
	filter: {
		datetime_geq: $datetimeStart
		datetime_leq: $datetimeEnd
	}
	orderBy: [count_DESC]
) {
	count
	dimensions {
		pipelineId
		errorFamily
		errorType
	}
}
```

Note

In addition to `pipelinesUserErrorsAdaptiveGroups`, you can also query the `pipelinesUserErrorsAdaptive` dataset, which provides detailed error descriptions within the last 24 hours. Be aware that querying this dataset may return a large volume of data if your pipeline processes many events.
