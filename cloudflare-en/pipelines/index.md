# Cloudflare Pipelines

Last updated Aug 7, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pipelines/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Note

Pipelines is in **open beta**, and any developer with a [Workers Paid plan](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/pricing/) can start using it.

Ingest, transform, and load streaming data into Apache Iceberg or Parquet in R2.

Available on Paid plans

Cloudflare Pipelines ingests events, transforms them with SQL, and delivers them to R2 as [Iceberg tables](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2-data-catalog/) or as Parquet and JSON files.

Whether you're processing server logs, mobile application events, IoT telemetry, or clickstream data, Pipelines provides durable ingestion via HTTP endpoints or Worker bindings, SQL-based transformations, and exactly-once delivery to R2\. This makes it easy to build analytics-ready data warehouses and lakehouses without managing streaming infrastructure.

Create your first pipeline by following the [getting started guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pipelines/getting-started) or running this [Wrangler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/) command:

```sh
npx wrangler pipelines setup
```
