# Delete variants

Last updated Apr 21, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/images/optimization/hosted-images/delete-variants/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

You can delete variants via the Images dashboard or API. The only variant you cannot delete is public.

Caution

Deleting a variant is a global action that will affect other images that contain that variant.

## Delete variants via the Cloudflare dashboard

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Hosted Images** page.  
[Go to **Hosted images** ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/images/hosted)
2. Select the **Delivery** tab.
3. Find the variant you want to remove and select **Delete**.

## Delete variants via the API

Make a `DELETE` request to the delete variant endpoint.

```bash
curl --request DELETE https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/{account_id}/images/v1/variants/{variant_name} \
--header "Authorization: Bearer <API_TOKEN>"
```

After the variant has been deleted, the response returns `"success": true.`
