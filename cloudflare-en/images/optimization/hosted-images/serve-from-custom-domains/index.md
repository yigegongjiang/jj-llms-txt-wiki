# Serve images from custom domains

Last updated Apr 21, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/images/optimization/hosted-images/serve-from-custom-domains/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Image delivery is supported from all customer domains under the same Cloudflare account. To serve images through custom domains, an image URL should be adjusted to the following format:

```txt
https://example.com/cdn-cgi/imagedelivery/<ACCOUNT_HASH>/<IMAGE_ID>/<VARIANT_NAME>
```

Example with a custom domain:

```txt
https://example.com/cdn-cgi/imagedelivery/ZWd9g1K7eljCn_KDTu_MWA/083eb7b2-5392-4565-b69e-aff66acddd00/public
```

In this example, `<ACCOUNT_HASH>`, `<IMAGE_ID>` and `<VARIANT_NAME>` are the same, but the hostname and prefix path is different:

* `example.com`: Cloudflare proxied domain under the same account as the Cloudflare Images.
* `/cdn-cgi/imagedelivery`: Path to trigger `cdn-cgi` image proxy.
* `ZWd9g1K7eljCn_KDTu_MWA`: The Images account hash. This can be found in the Cloudflare Images Dashboard.
* `083eb7b2-5392-4565-b69e-aff66acddd00`: The image ID.
* `public`: The variant name.

## Custom paths

By default, Images are served from the `/cdn-cgi/imagedelivery/` path. You can use [Transform Rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/transform/) to rewrite URLs and serve images from custom paths.

### Basic version

Free and Pro plans support string matching rules (including wildcard operations) that do not require regular expressions.

This example lets you rewrite a request from `example.com/images` to `example.com/cdn-cgi/imagedelivery/<ACCOUNT_HASH>`.

To create a rule:

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Rules Overview** page.  
[Go to **Overview** ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/:zone/rules/overview)
2. Next to **URL Rewrite Rules**, select **Create rule**.
3. Under **If incoming requests match**, select **Wildcard pattern** and enter the following **Request URL** (update with your own domain):  
```txt  
https://example.com/images/*  
```
4. Under **Then rewrite the path and/or query** \> **Path**, enter the following values (using your account hash):

  * **Target path**: \[`/`\] `images/*`
  * **Rewrite to**: \[`/`\] `cdn-cgi/imagedelivery/<ACCOUNT_HASH>/${1}`
5. Select **Deploy** when you are done.

### Advanced version

Note

This feature requires a Business or Enterprise plan to enable regular expressions in Transform Rules. Refer to Cloudflare [Transform Rules Availability](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/transform/#availability) for more information.

This example lets you rewrite a request from `example.com/images/some-image-id/w100,h300` to `example.com/cdn-cgi/imagedelivery/<ACCOUNT_HASH>/some-image-id/width=100,height=300` and assumes Flexible variants feature is turned on.

To create a rule:

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Rules Overview** page.  
[Go to **Overview** ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/:zone/rules/overview)
2. Next to **URL Rewrite Rules**, select **Create rule**.
3. Under **If incoming requests match**, select **Custom filter expression** and then select **Edit expression**.
4. In the text field, enter `(http.request.uri.path matches "^/images/.*$")`.
5. Under **Path**, select **Rewrite to**.
6. Select _Dynamic_ and enter the following in the text field.

```txt
regex_replace(
  http.request.uri.path,
  "^/images/(.*)\\?w([0-9]+)&h([0-9]+)$",
  "/cdn-cgi/imagedelivery/<ACCOUNT_HASH>/${1}/width=${2},height=${3}"
)
```

## Limitations

When using a custom domain, it is not possible to directly set up WAF rules that act on requests hitting the `/cdn-cgi/imagedelivery/` path. If you need to set up WAF rules, you can use a Cloudflare Worker to access your images and a Route using your domain to execute the worker. For an example worker, refer to [Serve private images using signed URL tokens](https://developers.cloudflare.com/images/optimization/hosted-images/serve-private-images/).
