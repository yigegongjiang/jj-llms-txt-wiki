# Upload via batch API

Last updated Apr 21, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/images/storage/upload-images/images-batch/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

The Images batch API lets you make several requests in sequence while bypassing Cloudflare’s global API rate limits.

To use the Images batch API, you will need to obtain a batch token and use the token to make several requests. The requests authorized by this batch token are made to a separate endpoint and do not count toward the global API rate limits. Each token is subject to a rate limit of 200 requests per second. You can use multiple tokens if you require higher throughput to the Cloudflare Images API.

To obtain a token, you can use the new `images/v1/batch_token` endpoint as shown in the example below.

```bash
curl "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/{account_id}/images/v1/batch_token" \
--header "Authorization: Bearer <API_TOKEN>"

# Response:
{
  "result": {
    "token": "<BATCH_TOKEN>",
    "expiresAt": "2023-08-09T15:33:56.273411222Z"
  },
  "success": true,
  "errors": [],
  "messages": []
}
```

After getting your token, use it to make requests for:

* [Upload an image](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/images/subresources/v1/methods/create/) \- `POST /images/v1`
* [Delete an image](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/images/subresources/v1/methods/delete/) \- `DELETE /images/v1/{identifier}`
* [Image details](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/images/subresources/v1/methods/get/) \- `GET /images/v1/{identifier}`
* [Update image](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/images/subresources/v1/methods/edit/) \- `PATCH /images/v1/{identifier}`
* [List images V2](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/images/subresources/v2/methods/list/) \- `GET /images/v2`
* [Direct upload V2](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/images/subresources/v2/subresources/direct%5Fuploads/methods/create/) \- `POST /images/v2/direct_upload`

These options use a different host and a different path with the same method, request, and response bodies.

```bash
curl "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/{account_id}/images/v2" \
--header "Authorization: Bearer <API_TOKEN>"
```

```bash
curl "https://batch.imagedelivery.net/images/v1" \
--header "Authorization: Bearer <BATCH_TOKEN>"
```
