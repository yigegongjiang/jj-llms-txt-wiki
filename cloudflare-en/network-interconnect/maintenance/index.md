# Maintenance

## Planned maintenance

Routine CNI-disruptive maintenance is planned work that can interrupt traffic on an affected CNI connection. Cloudflare coordinates this work across resilient Cloudflare Network Interconnect (CNI) deployments, including across CNI locations.

### Timing and scheduling

For Dataplane v2 connectivity in multi-homed PoPs only:

- **Routine maintenance**: Minimum one week notice.
- **Emergency maintenance**: Best-effort notice, which may be less than one week.
- Routine maintenance on redundant devices at the same location will occur on different days.
- Routine maintenance is not rescheduled to accommodate customer schedule preferences.

| CNI deployment | During routine CNI-disruptive maintenance |
| --- | --- |
| One CNI connection at one location | The connection can be interrupted. |
| Two CNI connections on separate devices at one location | One connection remains in service. |
| Four CNI connections across two coordinated locations, with two connections on separate devices at each location | Three connections remain in service. |

## Emergency and non-routine maintenance

Non-routine maintenance, such as maintenance that affects an entire PoP, can affect all CNI connections at the affected location. For the four-connection deployment with two connections at each of two locations, a full-PoP non-routine event at one location can interrupt two connections, leaving two in service. Cloudflare avoids performing non-routine maintenance at multiple coordinated locations at the same time.

Cloudflare coordinates emergency maintenance across locations where feasible.

## Receive maintenance notifications

To configure circuit-specific or point-of-presence (PoP) maintenance notifications, refer to [Monitoring and alerts](https://developers.cloudflare.com/network-interconnect/monitoring-and-alerts/).
