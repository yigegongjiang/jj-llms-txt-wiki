# Operational guidance

Last updated Sep 11, 2026|Copy as Markdown| [View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/network-interconnect/operational-guidance/index.md)| [Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

For maintenance expectations and notifications, refer to [Maintenance](https://developers.cloudflare.com/network-interconnect/maintenance/).

## Customer responsibility

Your CNI deployment must tolerate an unplanned outage on any single circuit at any time. This means:

- Traffic failover between redundant circuits must be automatic.
- If your operations require manual intervention to reroute traffic during maintenance, your configuration needs review.
- Contact your account team to validate your failover design.

## Troubleshooting

When facing connectivity problems, your first action should be to check for broader service disruptions. Visit [Cloudflare Status ↗︎](https://www.cloudflarestatus.com/) to see if any scheduled maintenance or active incidents are impacting services. This helps determine if the issue originates outside your network. Refer to [Monitoring and alerts](https://developers.cloudflare.com/network-interconnect/monitoring-and-alerts/).

If no system-wide problems are reported, gather the following information before submitting a support case. Providing comprehensive details facilitates a faster resolution:

- **Timeline**: When the issue began and ended (if applicable), including the timezone.
- **Identification**: The CNI IP address or point-to-point prefix for the impacted CNI. If your CNI is part of a Magic setup, please also provide the name of the Magic Transit/WAN interconnect as listed in your dashboard.
- **Physical Layer**: Light levels of the CNI link (if applicable).
- **Service Impact**: Confirmation whether Magic Transit / WAN traffic was affected.
- **Problem Description**: A clear summary of the issue (for example, CNI down, Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) session down, prefixes withdrawn).
