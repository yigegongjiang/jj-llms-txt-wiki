Last updated Apr 16, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/speed/optimization/content/rocket-loader/enable/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

To enable or disable Rocket Loader, use the following instructions.

To enable or disable **Rocket Loader** in the dashboard:

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Speed** \> **Settings** page.  
[Go to **Settings** ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/:zone/speed/optimization)
2. Go to **Content Optimization**.
3. For **Rocket Loader**, switch the toggle to **On**.

If you have a Content Security Policy (CSP) in place for your domain, you will need to [update your headers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/reference/policies-compliances/content-security-policies/#product-requirements) to support Rocket Loader.

To enable or disable **Rocket Loader** with the API, send a [PATCH](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/zones/subresources/settings/methods/edit/) request with `rocket_loader` as the setting name in the URI path, and the `value` parameter set to `"on"` or `"off"`.

If you have a Content Security Policy (CSP) in place for your domain, you will need to [update your headers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/reference/policies-compliances/content-security-policies/#product-requirements) to support Rocket Loader.

Note

To use this feature on specific hostnames - instead of across your entire zone - use a [configuration rule](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/configuration-rules/).
