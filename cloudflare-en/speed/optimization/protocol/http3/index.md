# HTTP/3 (with QUIC)

Last updated Apr 17, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/speed/optimization/protocol/http3/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

HTTP/3 uses QUIC, which is a secure-by-default transport protocol. HTTP/3 improves page load times in a similar way to HTTP/2\. However, the QUIC transport protocol solves TCP's head-of-line blocking problem, meaning that performance over lossy networks can be better.

Note

For more background on HTTP/3, visit the [Learning Center ↗](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/performance/what-is-http3/).

Note

This setting is for connection between the user and Cloudflare. HTTP/3 connection to the origin is not yet supported.

## Enable HTTP/3

HTTP/3 is available to all plans (though it does require an [SSL certificate at Cloudflare’s edge network](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/get-started/)).

To enable **HTTP/3** in the dashboard:

1. Log into the [Cloudflare dashboard ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com).
2. Select your account and zone.
3. Go to **Speed** \> **Settings**.
4. Go to **Protocol Optimization**.
5. For **HTTP/3**, switch the toggle to **On**.

To enable **HTTP/3** with the API, send a [PATCH](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/zones/subresources/settings/methods/edit/) request with `http3` as the setting name in the URI path, and the `value` parameter set to `"on"`.
