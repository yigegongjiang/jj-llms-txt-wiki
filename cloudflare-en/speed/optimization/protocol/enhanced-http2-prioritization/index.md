# Enhanced HTTP/2 Prioritization

Last updated Aug 14, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/speed/optimization/protocol/enhanced-http2-prioritization/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

With Enhanced HTTP/2 Prioritization, Cloudflare delivers resources in the optimal order for the fastest experience across all browsers. It also supports control of content delivery when used in conjunction with [Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/).

## Availability

|              | Free | Pro | Business | Enterprise |
| ------------ | ---- | --- | -------- | ---------- |
| Availability | No   | Yes | Yes      | Yes        |

## How it works

The speed of loading web content, from the user’s perspective, is dependent on the order in which the resources load. With HTTP/2, by default, Cloudflare will follow the order requested by the browser. This ordering varies from browser to browser, causing a significant difference in performance.

With Enhanced HTTP/2 Prioritization, Cloudflare overrides the default browser behavior to optimize the order of resource delivery, independent of the browser. The greatest improvements will be experienced by visitors using Safari and Edge browsers.
