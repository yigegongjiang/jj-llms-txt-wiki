# Get started

Last updated Apr 16, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/get-started/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

You can use Cloudflare DNS with a variety of [setups](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/zone-setups/). For an overview of what these setups are and an introduction to specific DNS terminology, refer to [Concepts](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/concepts/).

In the most common setup (full), you [add your domain](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/manage-domains/add-site/), import your [DNS records](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/manage-dns-records/), and [update your nameservers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/nameservers/update-nameservers/) to make Cloudflare your primary authoritative DNS provider.

Note

Make sure to [review your DNS records](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/zone-setups/full-setup/setup/#2-review-your-dns-records) before updating your nameservers. If you activate your domain on Cloudflare _without_ setting up the correct DNS records, your domain may not be reachable.

Once the setup is completed:

* You [manage DNS records](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/manage-dns-records/how-to/create-dns-records/) through the Cloudflare dashboard or API. This is how you control which resources are available on the apex domain (`example.com`) or specific subdomains (`blog.example.com`) of your website, as well as control other configurations.
* Cloudflare [responds to all DNS queries](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/concepts/how-cloudflare-works/) for your hostnames and your DNS records are propagated across the [Cloudflare global network ↗](https://www.cloudflare.com/network/), speeding up your domain.

## Resources

The following links introduce important concepts and will guide you through actions you may need to take while having your website or application on Cloudflare.

* [DNS records](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/manage-dns-records/): DNS records contain information about your domain and are used to make your website or application available to visitors and other web services.
* [Nameservers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/nameservers/): In the context of Cloudflare DNS, nameservers refer to authoritative nameservers. When a nameserver is authoritative for `example.com`, it means that DNS resolvers will consider responses from this nameserver when a user tries to access `example.com`.
* [Proxy status](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/proxy-status/): Proxy status affects how Cloudflare treats incoming HTTP/S requests to A, AAAA, and CNAME records. When a record is proxied, Cloudflare responds with [anycast IPs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/concepts/cloudflare-ip-addresses/), which speeds up and protects HTTP/S traffic with our [cache](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cache/)/[CDN ↗](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/what-is-a-cdn/), [DDoS protection](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ddos-protection/), [WAF](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/), and [more](https://developers.cloudflare.com/directory/?product-group=Application+performance%2CApplication+security).
