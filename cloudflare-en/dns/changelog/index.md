**Internal DNS is now generally available**  

[Internal DNS](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/internal-dns/) is now generally available. Internal DNS provides authoritative and recursive DNS for private networks on the same global network and control plane you already use for public DNS, Zero Trust, and application services.

#### Why it matters

* **Consolidate DNS operations.** Public and private DNS run on one platform, with one API, one audit trail, and one place to set policy.
* **Simplify split-horizon DNS.** Internal and external resolution are defined as separate [views](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/internal-dns/dns-views/) over shared zones, managed from a single control plane — so there is no drift to chase down.
* **Extend Zero Trust to DNS.** Resolver policies decide which users and devices resolve against which view, enforced by the same [Gateway](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/traffic-policies/) that already governs the rest of your traffic.

Setting up Internal DNS takes three steps: create a zone, create a view, and define a resolver policy.

```json
POST /zones
{
  "account": {
    "id": "<ACCOUNT_ID>"
  },
  "name": "corp.internal",
  "type": "internal"
}
```

Internal DNS is included with [Cloudflare Gateway](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/traffic-policies/) for Enterprise customers. To get started, refer to the [Internal DNS documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/internal-dns/).

**New DNS Firewall UX with more dashboard settings**  

The DNS Firewall page in the Cloudflare dashboard has been refreshed, bringing several settings that were previously API-only into the UI and modernizing how you view and manage your DNS Firewall clusters.

![New DNS Firewall UX](https://developers.cloudflare.com/_astro/dnsfw-new-ux.vHgdhBZD_10POx6.webp) 

#### What is new

* **More settings in the dashboard**: cluster options that were previously only configurable through the API — such as attack mitigation, rate limiting, negative TTL, and resolver subnet — are now available directly in the dashboard.
* **Better table experience**: the DNS Firewall cluster table has been revised to surface cluster details at a glance, with resizable columns and the option to show or hide columns to tailor the view to your workflow.
* **New create and edit UX**: adding and editing clusters now uses a modernized form that groups related settings together, making configuration faster and clearer.

#### Availability

Available to all DNS Firewall customers as part of their existing subscription.

#### Where to find it

In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **DNS Firewall** page.

[Go to **Clusters** ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/dns-firewall/clusters) 

For more information, refer to [DNS Firewall](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/dns-firewall/).

## 2026-06-10

  
**Account-level DNS records quota**  

Cloudflare now enforces DNS records quotas at the account level for Enterprise accounts. Instead of a per-zone limit, these accounts have a quota on the total number of records across all of their zones, letting you distribute records across your zones however you like — regardless of each zone's plan. Public and internal zones are counted separately, each with a default quota of 1,000,000 records.

Accounts without an account-level quota are unaffected: existing per-zone quotas behave exactly as before.

For more details, refer to [DNS records quota](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/manage-dns-records/#dns-records-quota).

## 2026-05-20

  
**New DNS records UX is rolling out**  

Starting today, everyone can opt in to a refreshed DNS records page in the Cloudflare dashboard. Over the coming weeks, the new experience will become the default for Free plan users first, followed by paid plans.

![New DNS records UX](https://developers.cloudflare.com/_astro/new-dns-ux.Bfs_yXPa_VJoah.webp) 

#### What is new

* **Better table experience**: resizable and hideable columns, row pinning, advanced filters with logical operators (AND/OR), configurable pagination, and expanded input fields so long values are no longer cut off.
* **First-class mobile experience**: responsive layout with a touch-friendly, card-based UI and compact controls for small screens.
* **DNS quick reference**: bite-sized explainers for DNS, proxy status, and TTL, available directly in the product to help users configure records without leaving the page.
* **Modern frontend**: a refactor onto Cloudflare's new UI framework that improves performance and lays the foundation for future improvements.
![New DNS records UX](https://developers.cloudflare.com/_astro/new-dns-ux.DV6gCbme_2cImvu.webp) 

#### Rollout plan

Dates are subject to change based on feedback received during the rollout.

* **20 May - 05 June**: ramped rollout to Free, then Pro and Business plans.
* **08 June - 03 July**: ramped rollout to Enterprise plans.

#### Share your feedback

Once the new experience is turned on for your account, look for the feedback link at the top of the DNS records page in the Cloudflare dashboard and let us know what you think. Your input helps us prioritize the next round of improvements.

## 2026-04-28

  
**Account-level enforce DNS-only**  

You can now disable Cloudflare's reverse proxy across all zones in your account simultaneously using the new `enforce_dns_only` setting. When enabled, Cloudflare responds to DNS queries for all proxied records with your origin IP addresses instead of Cloudflare's anycast IPs. This account-level kill switch is designed for incident response scenarios where you need to quickly route traffic directly to your origin servers.

Caution

Enabling this setting exposes your origin IP addresses and removes all Cloudflare protections — including DDoS mitigation, WAF, caching, and all other proxy-based features — for every zone in your account. Use with extreme caution and only after proper [preparations](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/proxy-status/enforce-dns-only/#preparation).

#### Key characteristics

* **Account-level** — Affects all zones in the account simultaneously with a single API call.
* **Non-destructive** — Does not modify your DNS records. Disabling the setting restores normal proxy behavior.
* **API-only** — Available through the API only, not in the Cloudflare dashboard.

#### What's affected

**Included:** Standard proxied A, AAAA, and CNAME records, Load Balancing records, and records matching Worker routes.

**Excluded:** Spectrum applications, Cloudflare Tunnel CNAMEs, R2 custom domains, Web3 gateways, and Workers custom domains continue to operate normally.

#### Before you enable

* Verify your origin servers can handle direct traffic without Cloudflare's caching and filtering.
* Review which origin IPs will become publicly visible through DNS queries.
* Test the API in a staging account before relying on it for incident response.

#### Availability

Available via API to all Cloudflare customers.

For information on how to use it, refer to [Enforce DNS-only developer documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/proxy-status/enforce-dns-only/) .

**Account-level DNS analytics now available via GraphQL Analytics API**  

Authoritative DNS analytics are now available on the **account level** via the [Cloudflare GraphQL Analytics API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/analytics/graphql-api/).

This allows users to query DNS analytics across multiple zones in their account, by using the `accounts` filter.

Here is an example to retrieve the most recent DNS queries across all zones in your account that resulted in an `NXDOMAIN` response over a given time frame. Please replace `a30f822fcd7c401984bf85d8f2a5111c` with your actual account ID.

```graphql
query GetLatestNXDOMAINResponses {
	viewer {
		accounts(filter: { accountTag: "a30f822fcd7c401984bf85d8f2a5111c" }) {
			dnsAnalyticsAdaptive(
				filter: {
					date_geq: "2025-06-16"
					date_leq: "2025-06-18"
					responseCode: "NXDOMAIN"
				}
				limit: 10000
				orderBy: [datetime_DESC]
			) {
				zoneTag
				queryName
				responseCode
				queryType
				datetime
			}
		}
	}
}
```

To learn more and get started, refer to the [DNS Analytics documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/additional-options/analytics/#analytics).

## 2025-06-11

  
**NSEC3 support for DNSSEC**  

Enterprise customers can now select NSEC3 as method for proof of non-existence on their zones.

What's new:

* **NSEC3 support for live-signed zones** – For both primary and secondary zones that are configured to be live-signed (also known as "on-the-fly signing"), NSEC3 can now be selected as proof of non-existence.
* **NSEC3 support for pre-signed zones** – Secondary zones that are transferred to Cloudflare in a [pre-signed setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/zone-setups/zone-transfers/cloudflare-as-secondary/dnssec-for-secondary/#set-up-pre-signed-dnssec) now also support NSEC3 as proof of non-existence.

For more information and how to enable NSEC3, refer to the [NSEC3 documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/dnssec/enable-nsec3/).

## 2025-06-03

  
**Improved onboarding for Shopify merchants**  

Shopify merchants can now onboard to **O2O** automatically, without needing to contact support or community members.

What's new:

* **Automatic enablement** – O2O is available for all mutual Cloudflare and Shopify customers.
* **Branded record display** – Merchants see a Shopify logo in DNS records, complete with helpful tooltips.  
![Shopify O2O logo](https://developers.cloudflare.com/_astro/shop-dns-icon-o2o.Ca5DAZHL_1weoif.webp)
* **Checkout protection** – Workers and Snippets are blocked from running on the checkout path to reduce risk and improve security.

For more information, refer to the [provider guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/saas-customers/provider-guides/shopify/).

## 2025-02-02

  
**Removed unused meta fields from DNS records**  

Cloudflare is removing five fields from the `meta` object of DNS records. These fields have been unused for more than a year and are no longer set on new records. This change may take up to four weeks to fully roll out.

The affected fields are:

* the `auto_added` boolean
* the `managed_by_apps` boolean and corresponding `apps_install_id`
* the `managed_by_argo_tunnel` boolean and corresponding `argo_tunnel_id`

An example record returned from the API would now look like the following:

```json
{
	"result": {
		"id": "<ID>",
		"zone_id": "<ZONE_ID>",
		"zone_name": "example.com",
		"name": "www.example.com",
		"type": "A",
		"content": "192.0.2.1",
		"proxiable": true,
		"proxied": false,
		"ttl": 1,
		"locked": false,
		"meta": {
			"auto_added": false,
			"managed_by_apps": false,
			"managed_by_argo_tunnel": false,
			"source": "primary"
		},
		"comment": null,
		"tags": [],
		"created_on": "2025-03-17T20:37:05.368097Z",
		"modified_on": "2025-03-17T20:37:05.368097Z"
	},
	"success": true,
	"errors": [],
	"messages": []
}
```

For more guidance, refer to [Manage DNS records](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/manage-dns-records/).

## 2025-01-27

**Zone IDs and names on individual DNS records**

Records returned by the API will no longer contain the `zone_id` and `zone_name` fields. This change may take up to four weeks to fully roll out. The affected fields were deprecated with an End of Life (EOL) date of November 30, 2024.

## 2024-10-15

**Quote validation for TXT records added via dashboard**

When creating [TXT records](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/manage-dns-records/reference/dns-record-types/#txt) via the dashboard you will now find:

* Field validation errors if double quotes `"` are added inconsistently.
* Automatically quoted TXT content upon save if no quotes exist in the record content field.

## 2024-10-07

**API support for per-record CNAME flattening**

Paid zones now have the option to flatten specific CNAME records. When using the API, specify the setting `cname_flatten` as `true` or `false`. Refer to the [documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/cname-flattening/set-up-cname-flattening/#per-record) for details.
