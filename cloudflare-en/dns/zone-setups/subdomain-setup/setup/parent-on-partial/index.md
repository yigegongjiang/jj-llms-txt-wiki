# Parent zone on partial setup

Last updated Apr 16, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/zone-setups/subdomain-setup/setup/parent-on-partial/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

When the parent zone is using a [CNAME setup (partial)](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/zone-setups/partial-setup/)[1](#user-content-fn-2), the steps to set up your child zone depend on whether the subdomain already exists in the parent domain.

## Subdomain does not exist

If you have not yet created a DNS record covering your subdomain in the parent zone:

1. Add the subdomain to a Cloudflare account as a new zone. It can be the same account where the parent zone exists or a different one.
2. Complete the configuration accordingly for [full](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/zone-setups/full-setup/setup/) or [secondary](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/zone-setups/zone-transfers/cloudflare-as-secondary/setup/) setup.
3. After creating the DNS records on the child zone, add the Cloudflare nameservers as `NS` records at your external DNS provider.
4. Within a short period of time, the child zone should be active.

1. Add the subdomain to a Cloudflare account as a new zone. It can be the same account where the parent zone exists or a different one.
2. Select either Business or Enterprise as your zone plan and complete the onboarding flow according to your needs.
3. On the [Overview page ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/:zone), select **Convert to CNAME DNS Setup**.
4. Confirm that you have created all the [DNS records](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/manage-dns-records/how-to/create-dns-records/) needed for your child zone.
5. On the [**DNS Records** ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/:zone/dns/records) page, get the **Verification TXT Record** and add it at your authoritative DNS provider.

Example verification record

A verification record for `sub.example.com` might be:

| Type | Name                              | Content             |
| ---- | --------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| TXT  | cloudflare-verify.sub.example.com | 966215192-518620144 |

If your authoritative DNS provider automatically appends DNS record `name` fields with your domain, make sure to only insert `cloudflare-verify` as the record name. Otherwise, it may result in an incorrect record name, such as `cloudflare-verify.sub.example.com.sub.example.com`.

After creating the record, you can use this [Dig Web Interface link ↗](https://digwebinterface.com/?type=TXT&ns=auth&nameservers=) to search (`dig`) for `cloudflare-verify.<YOUR DOMAIN>` and validate if it is working.

That record must remain in place for as long as your subdomain is active on the CNAME setup (partial) on Cloudflare.

1. Within a short period of time, the child zone should be active.
2. At your authoritative DNS provider, add `CNAME` records pointing to `{your-hostname}.cdn.cloudflare.net` for the subdomain you have added and any deeper subdomain records you want to proxy through Cloudflare.

Example CNAME record at authoritative DNS provider

The `CNAME` record for `sub.example.com` would be:

```txt
sub.example.com CNAME sub.example.com.cdn.cloudflare.net
```

## Subdomain already exists

If you have already created a DNS record covering your subdomain in the parent zone:

1. Add the subdomain to a Cloudflare account as a new zone. It can be the same account where the parent zone exists or a different one.
2. Complete the configuration accordingly for [full](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/zone-setups/full-setup/setup/) or [secondary](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/zone-setups/zone-transfers/cloudflare-as-secondary/setup/) setup.
3. In your child zone, [re-create all DNS records](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/manage-dns-records/how-to/create-dns-records/) that relate to your subdomain. This includes all DNS records deeper than the delegated subdomain, meaning that if you are delegating `www.example.com`, you should also move over records for `api.www.example.com`.  
Note  
If your child zone is on a primary setup (full), consider [exporting](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/manage-dns-records/how-to/import-and-export/#export-records) records from the parent zone, deleting all unnecessary records, and then [importing](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/manage-dns-records/how-to/import-and-export/#import-records) the records into your new zone.
4. Make sure that you migrate over any settings ([WAF custom rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/custom-rules/), [Rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/), [Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/), and more) that might be needed for the child zone.
5. In the child zone, [order an advanced SSL certificate](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/edge-certificates/advanced-certificate-manager/) that covers the child subdomain and any deeper subdomains.
6. Get the Cloudflare nameservers for the subdomain and add them as `NS` records at your external DNS provider.
7. Within a short period of time, the child zone should be active.
8. On the [**DNS Records** ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/:zone/dns/records) page of the parent zone, [delete](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/manage-dns-records/how-to/create-dns-records/#delete-dns-records) any `A`, `AAAA`, or `CNAME` records referencing the subdomain or any of its deeper subdomains.

1. Add the subdomain to a Cloudflare account as a new zone. It can be the same account where the parent zone exists or a different one.
2. Select either Business or Enterprise as your zone plan and complete the onboarding flow according to your needs.
3. On the [Overview page ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/:zone), select **Convert to CNAME DNS Setup**.
4. In your child zone, [re-create all DNS records](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/manage-dns-records/how-to/create-dns-records/) that relate to your subdomain. This includes all DNS records deeper than the subdomain you used to create the zone - if you are creating a zone for `www.example.com`, you should also move over records for `api.www.example.com`.  
Note  
Cloudflare recommends [exporting](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/manage-dns-records/how-to/import-and-export/#export-records) records from the parent zone, deleting all unnecessary records, and then [importing](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/manage-dns-records/how-to/import-and-export/#import-records) the records into your new zone.
5. Make sure that you migrate over any settings ([WAF custom rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/custom-rules/), [Rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/), [Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/), and more) that might be needed for the child zone.
6. In the child zone, [order an advanced SSL certificate](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/edge-certificates/advanced-certificate-manager/) that covers the child subdomain and any deeper subdomains.
7. On the [**DNS Records** ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/:zone/dns/records) page, get the **Verification TXT Record** and add it at your authoritative DNS provider.

Example verification record

A verification record for `sub.example.com` might be:

| Type | Name                              | Content             |
| ---- | --------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| TXT  | cloudflare-verify.sub.example.com | 966215192-518620144 |

If your authoritative DNS provider automatically appends DNS record `name` fields with your domain, make sure to only insert `cloudflare-verify` as the record name. Otherwise, it may result in an incorrect record name, such as `cloudflare-verify.sub.example.com.sub.example.com`.

After creating the record, you can use this [Dig Web Interface link ↗](https://digwebinterface.com/?type=TXT&ns=auth&nameservers=) to search (`dig`) for `cloudflare-verify.<YOUR DOMAIN>` and validate if it is working.

2. On the [**DNS Records** ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/:zone/dns/records) page of the parent zone, [delete](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/manage-dns-records/how-to/create-dns-records/#delete-dns-records) any previous `A`, `AAAA`, or `CNAME` records referencing the subdomain or any of its deeper subdomains.
3. At your authoritative DNS provider, confirm you have `CNAME` records pointing to `{your-hostname}.cdn.cloudflare.net` for the subdomain you have added and any deeper subdomain records you want to proxy through Cloudflare.

Example CNAME record at authoritative DNS provider

The `CNAME` record for `sub.example.com` would be:

```txt
sub.example.com CNAME sub.example.com.cdn.cloudflare.net
```

1. Meaning that another DNS provider - not Cloudflare - maintains your Authoritative DNS. [↩](#user-content-fnref-2)
