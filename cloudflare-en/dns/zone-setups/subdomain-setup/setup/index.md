# Setup

Last updated Apr 29, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/zone-setups/subdomain-setup/setup/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Availability

Subdomain setup is only available for Enterprise accounts. If you only want to create a subdomain for your site in Cloudflare, refer to [Create a subdomain record](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/manage-dns-records/how-to/create-subdomain/).

[Subdomain setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/zone-setups/subdomain-setup/) relies on a process known as delegation. When, in a parent domain such as `example.com`, an [NS record ↗](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/dns-ns-record/) is created for a subdomain `blog.example.com`, this means that DNS management for the subdomain can be done separately, in its own [DNS zone](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/concepts/#zone).

## Available setups

When configuring a subdomain setup, its availability will depend on both the parent zone setup and the setup used for the child zone. A child zone holds DNS management for a delegated subdomain.

Subdomain zones in partial setup are not delegated

Subdomains using a CNAME setup (partial) represent an exception in the sense that delegation does not apply in this context. As explained in the dedicated [CNAME setup (Partial) section](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/zone-setups/partial-setup/), this setup is intended to simply proxy individual subdomains through Cloudflare. For completeness, however, this is listed as an option in this table and the [how-to guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/zone-setups/subdomain-setup/setup/parent-on-partial/) has detailed explanation on how to achieve a subdomain zone using a CNAME setup (partial).

This table assumes zones that are in an [active status](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/zone-setups/reference/domain-status/). For example, if you need to add the parent zone to Cloudflare when its child zone already exists in a CNAME setup (partial), you can [convert the parent zone to a CNAME setup (partial)](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/zone-setups/partial-setup/setup/#1-convert-your-zone-and-review-dns-records) while it is still in pending status.

## How to

Refer to the following guides to learn how to configure a subdomain setup depending on the setup used for the parent zone:

* [Parent zone on full setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/zone-setups/subdomain-setup/setup/parent-on-full/)
* [Parent zone on partial setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/zone-setups/subdomain-setup/setup/parent-on-partial/)

Although the how-to guides in this documentation are focused on both parent domains and subdomains existing in Cloudflare, it is also possible to achieve a subdomain setup in Cloudflare while the parent domain exists in a different DNS provider.

## SSL/TLS certificates

When using subdomain setup, you should consider possible interactions between parent zone and child zone configurations that could impact [SSL/TLS certificates](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/) provisioning.

If a certificate is already active on the child zone for a specific hostname (`subdomain.example.com`), any certificate pack containing that exact hostname in the parent zone (`example.com`) will fail validation.

## Access applications

To use subdomain setups with [Cloudflare Access](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/access-controls/policies/), note that:

* If the child zone is in a pending state when you create the Access application, your configuration will not automatically apply when you activate the zone. You must also re-save the Access application once your subdomain setup is active.
* If you split out a subdomain which already has an Access application, you will also need to re-save the Access application to associate it with the new child zone.
