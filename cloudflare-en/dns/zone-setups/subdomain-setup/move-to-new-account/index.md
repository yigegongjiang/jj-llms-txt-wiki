# Migrate to new account

Last updated Apr 16, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/zone-setups/subdomain-setup/move-to-new-account/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

When using a [subdomain setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/zone-setups/subdomain-setup/), you can have your subdomain as a separate zone within the same account as the parent domain or within a different account.

If you have already [created a standalone subdomain zone](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/zone-setups/subdomain-setup/setup/) within the same account, you can still move it to a separate account.

1. [Add the subdomain](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/manage-domains/add-site/) to a new Cloudflare account.
2. In the original subdomain zone, [export](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/manage-dns-records/how-to/import-and-export/#export-records) the DNS records.
3. Review the exported records, delete any unnecessary ones, and [import](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/manage-dns-records/how-to/import-and-export/#import-records) them into the new subdomain zone.
4. Update the `NS` records in the parent zone to refer to the newly assigned nameservers of the child zone.
