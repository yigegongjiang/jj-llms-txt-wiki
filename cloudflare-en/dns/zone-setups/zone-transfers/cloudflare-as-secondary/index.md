# Cloudflare as Secondary

Last updated Apr 16, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/zone-setups/zone-transfers/cloudflare-as-secondary/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

With incoming zone transfers, you can keep your primary DNS provider and use Cloudflare as a secondary DNS provider.

When you make edits in your primary DNS provider, those DNS records will be transferred from your primary DNS provider to Cloudflare via zone transfer using [AXFR ↗](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5936) or [IXFR ↗](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1995).
