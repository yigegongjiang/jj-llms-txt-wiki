# Troubleshooting

Last updated Apr 16, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/zone-setups/zone-transfers/troubleshooting/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

When [updating your registrar](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/zone-setups/zone-transfers/cloudflare-as-secondary/setup/#4-update-registrar) with the Cloudflare secondary nameservers (`nsXXXX.secondary.cloudflare.com`), you get an error.

Note

The exact error message depends on the system. Some examples would be: `Entity reference not found`,` Authorization error`, `Unable to create foreign nameserver`.

Upon contacting your registrar, their services confirm that the Cloudflare nameservers cannot be added at this time.

---

## Cause

This issue may arise when one of the Cloudflare nameservers used for secondary setup is removed from the Verisign side.

---

## Solution

The Cloudflare engineering team needs to be engaged [through Support](https://developers.cloudflare.com/support/contacting-cloudflare-support/) to make sure the nameserver gets registered again manually at Verisign.
