# Cloudflare as Primary

Last updated Apr 16, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/zone-setups/zone-transfers/cloudflare-as-primary/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

With outgoing zone transfers, you can use Cloudflare as your primary DNS provider and configure one or more peer DNS servers as secondary DNS providers.

When you [make edits](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/manage-dns-records/how-to/create-dns-records/) to Cloudflare DNS, those DNS records will be transferred from Cloudflare to your secondary provider via zone transfer using [AXFR ↗](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5936) or [IXFR ↗](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1995)

## How to

* [Set up outgoing zone transfers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/zone-setups/zone-transfers/cloudflare-as-primary/setup/)

## Availability

Outgoing zone transfers are available to Enterprise customers who are currently using Cloudflare as their [authoritative DNS provider](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/zone-setups/full-setup/). For more details on activation and pricing, contact your account team.

## Notes

If you use [Cloudflare Load Balancing](https://developers.cloudflare.com/load-balancing/), only proxied Load Balancer DNS records will be transferred.
