# Domain deleted from Cloudflare

Last updated Apr 16, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/zone-setups/troubleshooting/domain-deleted/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Domain deletion commonly occurs for the following reasons:

* A user with access to the domain removed it.
* The nameservers no longer point to Cloudflare. Cloudflare continuously monitors domain registration.
* The domain was not authenticated (pending for 28 days).

---

## Check Audit Logs

Cloudflare [Audit Logs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/account/account-security/review-audit-logs/) contain information about domain deletion.

Note

_Delete_ is an **Action** that denotes domain deletion but is also commonly used for deletion of other various account settings. Therefore, ensure that **Resource** says _Zone_.

## Check registrar for Cloudflare nameservers

If your domain was using a [primary setup (full)](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/zone-setups/full-setup/), your registrar needs to use Cloudflare nameservers as the authoritative nameservers for your domain.

1. Use either the command-line based `whois` application provided with your operating system or a website such as [ICANN Lookup ↗](https://lookup.icann.org/).

  * If you are unable to find the nameserver details for your domain, reach out to your domain registrar or domain provider to provide the domain registration information.
  * Ensure Cloudflare's nameservers are the only two nameservers listed in the domain registration details.
  * Ensure nameservers are spelled correctly in the domain registration.
2. Confirm that the nameservers exactly match the nameservers provided within the **Cloudflare Nameservers** card on the [**DNS Records** ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/:zone/dns/records) page.
3. If you identify incorrect information, log in to your domain provider's portal to make updates or contact your domain provider for assistance.

## Recover a deleted domain

To recover a deleted domain, [re-add it in Cloudflare](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/manage-domains/add-site/) just like you would for a new domain.

Caution

Cloudflare support is unable to restore DNS or settings for deleted domains.
