# Internal DNS

Last updated Jul 16, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/internal-dns/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Simplify private network management with Cloudflare DNS for your internal resources.

Enterprise-only

Manage DNS records that should only be accessible within your private network. Internal DNS [zones](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/internal-dns/internal-zones/) and [views](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/internal-dns/dns-views/) pair up with [Gateway resolver policies](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/traffic-policies/resolver-policies/) so that you can control how a DNS query should be responded to according to query context, such as query source IP.

Internal DNS is included with [Cloudflare Gateway](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/traffic-policies/) for Enterprise customers. There is no additional SKU or separate subscription required.

## Architecture overview

You can use different [connectivity options](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/internal-dns/connectivity/) to on-ramp your traffic to Cloudflare. Then, Cloudflare Gateway resolver acts as an interface between the DNS client and internal DNS zones.

Internal DNS zones do not get assigned Cloudflare nameservers and can only be queried via Cloudflare Gateway resolver.

				Z[(Internal DNS)]
        end
        end

        B --Query--> Y
        X --Query + View ID--> Z
        A --Query--> B
				A --Query--> X
				C --Query--> Y

Internal DNS zones are grouped into DNS views, which are selected by the resolver policy you define. Views are usually logical groupings relevant to your organization, such as different geographical locations.

        subgraph Internal DNS
        subgraph View 111 - London
        Y[Zone 600 <br /> example.local]
				Z[Zone 601 <br /> local]
        end
        subgraph View 110 - San Francisco
        X[Zone 101 <br /> example.com]
				B[Zone 100 <br /> example.local]
				S[Zone 102 <br /> com]
        end
				W[Zone 701 <br /> net]
				end

Internal DNS zones contain the [DNS records](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/internal-dns/internal-zones/internal-dns-records/) that should be used to resolve an internal DNS query. Also, if no internal record is found within a matching internal zone, Cloudflare will check if the matching internal zone is [referencing another internal zone](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/internal-dns/internal-zones/reference-zones/).

        accTitle: Internal DNS zones and internal records
        accDescr: Diagram exemplifying Internal DNS zones and records relationship
        subgraph View 111 - London
				subgraph Zone 601 - local
				S["@ A 192.0.2.10"]
				T["ghi.example A 192.0.2.15"]
				end
        subgraph Zone 600 - example.local
				X["@ A 192.0.2.1"]
				Y["abc A 192.0.2.6"]
				Z["def A 192.0.2.9"]
				end
				end

In this example, a query for `ghi.example.local` routed to view ID 111 would go to zone 600, which presents the longest matching zone name (`example.local`). Zone 600 does not contain a record for `ghi` but, if it is referencing zone 601, Cloudflare will then look for the queried record within the reference zone.
