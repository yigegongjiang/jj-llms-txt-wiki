# Internal zones

Last updated Apr 17, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/internal-dns/internal-zones/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Internal DNS zones are groupings of internal DNS records. While [public DNS records](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/manage-dns-records/) contain information about resources that you want to make available to the public Internet, [internal DNS records](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/internal-dns/internal-zones/internal-dns-records/) allow you to manage resources that should only be available within your private network.

Refer to [Manage internal zones](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/internal-dns/internal-zones/setup/) for a full list of configuration conditions and step-by-step instructions.

Internal DNS zones do not get assigned Cloudflare nameservers and can only be queried via [Cloudflare Gateway](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/traffic-policies/resolver-policies/) when linked to a [DNS view](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/internal-dns/dns-views/). The Gateway configuration must exist within the same Cloudflare account where the internal zone exists.
