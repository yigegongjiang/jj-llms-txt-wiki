# NS records already exist

Last updated Apr 16, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/manage-dns-records/troubleshooting/existing-ns-record/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

As you try to create a new DNS record, Cloudflare displays the following error:

```txt
NS records with that host already exist. (Code:81056)
```

## Causes

When a child domain (`blog.example.com`) of your domain (`example.com`) has been set up as a separate [subdomain zone](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/zone-setups/subdomain-setup/), corresponding `NS` records must have been placed within the parent zone.

When you are managing DNS records for the parent zone (in this example, `example.com`), you cannot create IP address resolution records (`A`, `AAAA`, or `CNAME`) with a name that specifies the same subdomain that already exists as a separate subdomain zone.

| Type | Name | Content   | TTL  |
| ---- | ---- | --------- | ---- |
| A    | blog | 192.0.2.0 | Auto |

## Solution

Before creating such records, remove any `NS` records with the same name.

Important

This action might be reverting an existing subdomain setup and may incur in downtime. Refer to [Rollback subdomain setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/zone-setups/subdomain-setup/rollback/) for more guidance.
