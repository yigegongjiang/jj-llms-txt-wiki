# Migrate an existing zone with DNSSEC enabled

Follow this tutorial to migrate an existing DNS zone to Cloudflare without having to disable DNSSEC.

Caution

This procedure involves cross-importing the [zone signing keys (ZSKs) ↗](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/dnskey-ds-records/) from one provider to the other. To learn more about this, consider this article [about multi-signer DNSSEC](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/dnssec/multi-signer-dnssec/about/) or refer to [RFC 8901 ↗](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8901.html).

This is an advanced procedure and assume some familiarity with [DNS concepts](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/concepts/), [API operations](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/), and basic setup steps. Assumed knowledge that is not detailed in this tutorial can be referenced through the linked content in each of the steps.

## Requirement

The provider you are migrating from must allow you to add DNSKEY records on the zone apex and use these records in responses to DNS queries.

## 1\. Set up Cloudflare

1. [Add your zone to Cloudflare](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/manage-domains/add-site/).  
To add your zone using the API, refer to the [Create Zone endpoint](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/zones/methods/create/).
2. [Review the records found by the automatic scan](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/manage-dns-records/how-to/create-dns-records/) or [import your zone file](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/manage-dns-records/how-to/import-and-export/).  
To import the zone file using the API, refer to the [Import DNS Records endpoint](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/dns/subresources/records/methods/import/).
3. On the [**DNS Settings** ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/:zone/dns/settings) page, select **Enable DNSSEC**. Or use the following [API request](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/dns/subresources/dnssec/methods/edit/).

Required API token permissions

At least one of the following [token permissions](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/reference/permissions/) is required:
* `DNS Write`

```bash
curl "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/$ZONE_ID/dnssec" \
	--request PATCH \
	--header "Authorization: Bearer $CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN" \
	--json '{
		"status": "active"
	}'
```

1. On the [**DNS Settings** ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/:zone/dns/settings) page, enable **Multi-signer DNSSEC**. Or use the following [API request](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/dns/subresources/dnssec/methods/edit/).

Required API token permissions

At least one of the following [token permissions](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/reference/permissions/) is required:
* `DNS Write`

```bash
curl "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/$ZONE_ID/dnssec" \
	--request PATCH \
	--header "Authorization: Bearer $CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN" \
	--json '{
		"dnssec_multi_signer": true
	}'
```

## 2\. Cross-import ZSKs

1. Add the [ZSK ↗](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/dnskey-ds-records/) of your previous provider to Cloudflare by creating a DNSKEY record on your zone.

You can do this [on the dashboard](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/manage-dns-records/how-to/create-dns-records/#create-dns-records) or through the [Create DNS Record endpoint](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/dns/subresources/records/methods/create/), as in the following example.

Required API token permissions

At least one of the following [token permissions](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/reference/permissions/) is required:
* `DNS Write`

```bash
curl "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/$ZONE_ID/dns_records" \
	--request POST \
	--header "Authorization: Bearer $CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN" \
	--json '{
		"type": "DNSKEY",
		"name": "<ZONE_NAME>",
		"data": {
				"flags": 256,
				"protocol": 3,
				"algorithm": 13,
				"public_key": "<PUBLIC_KEY>"
		},
		"ttl": 3600
	}'
```

1. Get Cloudflare's ZSK using either the API or a query from one of the assigned Cloudflare nameservers.

API example:

```bash
curl https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/{zone_id}/dnssec/zsk \
--header "X-Auth-Email: <EMAIL>" \
--header "X-Auth-Key: <API_KEY>"
```

Command line query example:

```sh
dig <ZONE_NAME> dnskey @<CLOUDFLARE_NAMESERVER> +noall +answer | grep 256
```

1. Add Cloudflare's ZSK that you fetched in the last step to your previous provider.

Note

You can check if both providers are responding with both ZSKs by running one `dig` command for each, as in the following example. You can also use [Dig Web Interface ↗](https://www.digwebinterface.com/?type=DNSKEY).

```sh
dig <ZONE_NAME> dnskey @<PREVIOUS_PROVIDER_NAMESERVER> +noall +answer
dig <ZONE_NAME> dnskey @<CLOUDFLARE_NAMESERVER> +noall +answer
```

Both queries should return both ZSKs (identified with tag `256`).

Example

```sh
dig multisigner.info dnskey @dns1.p01.nsone.net. +noall +answer
```

```sh
multisigner.info.    3600    IN    DNSKEY    257 3 13 t+4D<bla_bla_bla>JBmA==
multisigner.info.    3600    IN    DNSKEY    256 3 13 pxEU<bla_bla_bla>0xOg==
multisigner.info.    3600    IN    DNSKEY    256 3 13 oJM<bla_bla_bla>XhSA==
```

```sh
dig multisigner.info dnskey @ashley.ns.cloudflare.com +noall +answer
```

```sh
multisigner.info.    3600    IN    DNSKEY    257 3 13 mdss<bla_bla_bla>eKGQ==
multisigner.info.    3600    IN    DNSKEY    256 3 13 oJM<bla_bla_bla>XhSA==
multisigner.info.    3600    IN    DNSKEY    256 3 13 pxEU<bla_bla_bla>0xOg==
```

## 3\. Set up registrar

1. Add Cloudflare DS record to your registrar. You can see your Cloudflare DS record on the [**DNS Settings** ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/:zone/dns/settings) page, under **DS Record**.
2. Add Cloudflare assigned nameservers to your registrar. You can see your Cloudflare nameservers on the [**DNS Records** ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/:zone/dns/records) page

At this point your zone is in a [multi-signer DNSSEC setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/dnssec/multi-signer-dnssec/).

## 4\. Remove previous provider

1. Remove your previous provider's DS record from your registrar.
2. Remove your previous provider's nameservers from your registrar.
3. After waiting at least one and a half times the [TTL ↗](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/glossary/time-to-live-ttl/) of your previous provider DS record, you can remove the DNSKEY record (containing your previous provider ZSK) that you added to your Cloudflare zone in [step 2](#2-cross-import-zsks).

Note

You can find out the TTL of your previous provider DS record by running a `dig` command, as in the following example, or by using this [Dig Web Interface link ↗](https://www.digwebinterface.com/?type=DS).

```sh
dig multisigner.info ds +noall +answer
```

```sh
multisigner.info. 3600 IN DS 2371 13 2 227B4C7FF3E1D49D59BAF39BDA54CA0839DE700DD9896076AA3E6AD7 19A0CF55
multisigner.info. 3600 IN DS 48553 13 2 893709B51A9C53D011A4054B15FC5454BEDF68E739BB3B3FA1E333DA 7B8DACFE
```

In this example, both DS records have a TTL of `3600` seconds. Cloudflare's DS record always has the key tag set to `2371`, so the second line of the response is the DS record of the other provider.
