# Use only Brotli compression for a specific path

Create a compression rule to set Brotli as the only supported compression algorithm for a specific URI path.

Last updated Oct 13, 2025|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/compression-rules/examples/only-brotli-url-path/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

The following example rule will configure only Brotli compression for a specific URI path.

**When incoming requests match**

* Custom filter expression:  
  * _URI Path_ _equals_ `/download/assets.tar`

**Then**

* **Compression options**: Custom
* **Define a custom order for compression types**: `Brotli`

Since the rule configuration does not include _Auto_ at the end of the custom algorithms list, the response will be uncompressed if the web visitor does not support Brotli.

The following example sets the rules of an existing [entry point ruleset](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/about/rulesets/#entry-point-ruleset) (with ID `{ruleset_id}`) for the `http_response_compression` phase to a single compression rule, using the [Update a zone ruleset](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/rulesets/methods/update/) operation:

Required API token permissions

At least one of the following [token permissions](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/reference/permissions/) is required:
* `Response Compression Write`
* `Config Settings Write`
* `Dynamic URL Redirects Write`
* `Cache Settings Write`
* `Custom Errors Write`
* `Origin Write`
* `Managed headers Write`
* `Zone Transform Rules Write`
* `Mass URL Redirects Write`
* `Magic Firewall Write`
* `L4 DDoS Managed Ruleset Write`
* `HTTP DDoS Managed Ruleset Write`
* `Sanitize Write`
* `Transform Rules Write`
* `Select Configuration Write`
* `Bot Management Write`
* `Zone WAF Write`
* `Account WAF Write`
* `Account Rulesets Write`
* `Logs Write`
* `Logs Write`

```bash
curl "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/$ZONE_ID/rulesets/$RULESET_ID" \
	--request PUT \
	--header "Authorization: Bearer $CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN" \
	--json '{
		"rules": [
				{
						"ref": "use_only_brotli_for_assets_tar",
						"expression": "http.request.uri.path eq \"/download/assets.tar\"",
						"action": "compress_response",
						"action_parameters": {
								"algorithms": [
										{
												"name": "brotli"
										}
								]
						}
				}
		]
	}'
```

Use the `ref` field to get stable rule IDs across updates when using Terraform. Adding this field prevents Terraform from recreating the rule on changes. For more information, refer to [Troubleshooting](https://developers.cloudflare.com/terraform/troubleshooting/rule-id-changes/#how-to-keep-the-same-rule-id-between-modifications) in the Terraform documentation.
