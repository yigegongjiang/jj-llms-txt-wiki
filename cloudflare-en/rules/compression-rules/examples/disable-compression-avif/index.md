# Disable compression for AVIF images

Create a compression rule to turn off compression for AVIF images, based on either the content type or the file extension specified in the request.

Last updated Aug 25, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/compression-rules/examples/disable-compression-avif/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

The following example rule will disable compression for AVIF images, based on either the content type or the file extension specified in the request.

**When incoming requests match**

* Custom filter expression:  
  * _Media Type_ _equals_ `image/avif` **OR**
  * _File extension_ _equals_ `avif`

**Then**

* **Compression options** \> _Disable compression_

The following example sets the rules of an existing [entry point ruleset](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/about/rulesets/#entry-point-ruleset) (with ID `{ruleset_id}`) for the `http_response_compression` phase to a single compression rule, using the [Update a zone ruleset](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/rulesets/methods/update/) operation:

Required API token permissions

At least one of the following [token permissions](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/reference/permissions/) is required:
* `Response Compression Write`
* `Config Settings Write`
* `Dynamic URL Redirects Write`
* `Cache Settings Write`
* `Custom Errors Write`
* `Origin Write`
* `Managed headers Write`
* `Zone Transform Rules Write`
* `Mass URL Redirects Write`
* `Magic Firewall Write`
* `L4 DDoS Managed Ruleset Write`
* `HTTP DDoS Managed Ruleset Write`
* `Sanitize Write`
* `Transform Rules Write`
* `Select Configuration Write`
* `Bot Management Write`
* `Zone WAF Write`
* `Account WAF Write`
* `Account Rulesets Write`
* `Logs Write`
* `Logs Write`

```bash
curl "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/$ZONE_ID/rulesets/$RULESET_ID" \
	--request PUT \
	--header "Authorization: Bearer $CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN" \
	--json '{
		"rules": [
				{
						"ref": "disable_compression_for_avif",
						"expression": "http.response.content_type.media_type eq \"image/avif\" or http.request.uri.path.extension eq \"avif\"",
						"action": "compress_response",
						"action_parameters": {
								"algorithms": [
										{
												"name": "none"
										}
								]
						}
				}
		]
	}'
```

Use the `ref` field to get stable rule IDs across updates when using Terraform. Adding this field prevents Terraform from recreating the rule on changes. For more information, refer to [Troubleshooting](https://developers.cloudflare.com/terraform/troubleshooting/rule-id-changes/#how-to-keep-the-same-rule-id-between-modifications) in the Terraform documentation.
