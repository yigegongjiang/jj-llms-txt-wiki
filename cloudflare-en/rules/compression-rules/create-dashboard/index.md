# Create a compression rule in the dashboard

Last updated Apr 16, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/compression-rules/create-dashboard/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the Rules **Overview** page.  
[Go to **Overview** ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/:zone/rules/overview)
2. Select **Create rule** \> **Compression Rule**.
3. (Optional) Select one of the rule templates that address common use cases. Then, review and adjust the proposed rule configuration.
4. Enter a descriptive name for the rule in **Rule name**.
5. Under **When incoming requests match**, select if you wish to apply the rule to [default content types](https://developers.cloudflare.com/speed/optimization/content/compression/#compression-between-cloudflare-and-website-visitors) (content types that Cloudflare compresses by default), or to requests that match a custom filter expression.
6. (Optional) To define a custom expression, use the Expression Builder (specifying one or more values for **Field**, **Operator**, and **Value**) or manually enter an expression using the Expression Editor. For more information, refer to [Edit expressions in the dashboard](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/rules-language/expressions/edit-expressions/).
7. Under **Compression options**, set the [compression options](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/compression-rules/settings/#dashboard-configuration-settings).
8. To save and deploy your rule, select **Deploy**. If you are not ready to deploy your rule, select **Save as Draft**.  
If you are matching a hostname in your rule expression, you may be prompted to create a proxied DNS record for that hostname. Refer to [Troubleshooting](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/reference/troubleshooting/#this-rule-may-not-apply-to-your-traffic) for more information.
