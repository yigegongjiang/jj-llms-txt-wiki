# Managed Transforms

Last updated Apr 16, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/transform/managed-transforms/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Managed Transforms allow you to perform common adjustments to HTTP request and response headers with pre-built, one-step configurations. The available adjustments include:

* Add bot protection request headers.
* Remove or add headers related to the visitor's IP address.
* Add request header when Cloudflare detects [leaked credentials](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/detections/leaked-credentials/).
* Add security-related response headers.
* Remove `X-Powered-By` response headers.

For a complete list, refer to [Available Managed Transforms](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/transform/managed-transforms/reference/).

When you enable a Managed Transform, Cloudflare internally deploys one or more Transform Rules to handle the common configuration you selected. These generated rules will not count against the [maximum number of Transform Rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/transform/#availability) available in your Cloudflare plan.

Enabled Managed Transforms will apply to all inbound requests for the [zone](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/concepts/accounts-and-zones/#zones) (domain or subdomain added to Cloudflare).

Note

The generated internal Transform Rules will not appear in the Transform Rules list in the Cloudflare dashboard.
