# Create a URL rewrite rule via API

Last updated Aug 25, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/transform/url-rewrite/create-api/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Use the [Rulesets API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/rulesets-api/) to create URL Rewrite Rules via API. Refer to the [Rules examples gallery](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/transform/examples/?operation=Rewrite+URL) for common use cases.

If you are using Terraform, refer to [Transform Rules configuration using Terraform](https://developers.cloudflare.com/terraform/additional-configurations/transform-rules/#create-a-url-rewrite-rule).

## Basic rule settings

When creating a URL rewrite rule via API, make sure you:

* Set the rule action to `rewrite`.
* Define the [URL rewrite parameters](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/transform/url-rewrite/reference/parameters/#api-information) in the `action_parameters` field according to the type of URL rewrite (static or dynamic).
* Deploy the rule to the `http_request_transform` phase at the zone level.

## Procedure

Follow this workflow to create a URL rewrite rule for a given zone via API:

1. Use the [List zone rulesets](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/rulesets/methods/list/) operation to check if there is already a ruleset for the `http_request_transform` phase at the zone level.
2. If the phase ruleset does not exist, create it using the [Create a zone ruleset](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/rulesets/methods/create/) operation. In the new ruleset properties, set the following values:

  * **kind**: `zone`
  * **phase**: `http_request_transform`
3. Use the [Update a zone ruleset](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/rulesets/methods/update/) operation to add a URL rewrite rule to the list of ruleset rules. Alternatively, include the rule in the [Create a zone ruleset](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/rulesets/methods/create/) request mentioned in the previous step.

Make sure your API token has the [required permissions](#required-api-token-permissions) to perform the API operations.

## Example requests

Example: Add a rule that performs a static URL rewrite

The following example sets the rules of an existing phase ruleset (`$RULESET_ID`) to a single URL rewrite rule — performing a static rewrite of the URI path — using the [Update a zone ruleset](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/rulesets/methods/update/) operation. The response will contain the complete definition of the ruleset you updated.

Required API token permissions

At least one of the following [token permissions](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/reference/permissions/) is required:
* `Response Compression Write`
* `Config Settings Write`
* `Dynamic URL Redirects Write`
* `Cache Settings Write`
* `Custom Errors Write`
* `Origin Write`
* `Managed headers Write`
* `Zone Transform Rules Write`
* `Mass URL Redirects Write`
* `Magic Firewall Write`
* `L4 DDoS Managed Ruleset Write`
* `HTTP DDoS Managed Ruleset Write`
* `Sanitize Write`
* `Transform Rules Write`
* `Select Configuration Write`
* `Bot Management Write`
* `Zone WAF Write`
* `Account WAF Write`
* `Account Rulesets Write`
* `Logs Write`
* `Logs Write`

```bash
curl "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/$ZONE_ID/rulesets/$RULESET_ID" \
	--request PUT \
	--header "Authorization: Bearer $CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN" \
	--json '{
		"rules": [
				{
						"ref": "rewrite_eu_to_emea",
						"expression": "(http.request.uri.query contains \"eu\")",
						"description": "My first static URL rewrite rule",
						"action": "rewrite",
						"action_parameters": {
								"uri": {
										"path": {
												"value": "/emea.html"
										}
								}
						}
				}
		]
	}'
```

```json
{
	"result": {
		"ref": "rewrite_eu_to_emea",
		"id": "<RULESET_ID>",
		"name": "Zone-level Transform Ruleset",
		"description": "Zone-level ruleset that will execute Transform Rules.",
		"kind": "zone",
		"version": "2",
		"rules": [
			{
				"id": "<RULE_ID>",
				"version": "1",
				"action": "rewrite",
				"action_parameters": {
					"uri": {
						"path": {
							"value": "/emea.html"
						}
					}
				},
				"expression": "(http.request.uri.query contains \"eu\")",
				"description": "My first static URL rewrite rule",
				"last_updated": "2021-04-14T14:42:04.219025Z",
				"ref": "<RULE_REF>"
			}
		],
		"last_updated": "2021-04-14T14:42:04.219025Z",
		"phase": "http_request_transform"
	},
	"success": true,
	"errors": [],
	"messages": []
}
```

Use the `ref` field to get stable rule IDs across updates when using Terraform. Adding this field prevents Terraform from recreating the rule on changes. For more information, refer to [Troubleshooting](https://developers.cloudflare.com/terraform/troubleshooting/rule-id-changes/#how-to-keep-the-same-rule-id-between-modifications) in the Terraform documentation.

Example: Add a rule that performs a dynamic URL rewrite

The following example sets the rules of an existing phase ruleset (`$RULESET_ID`) to a single URL rewrite rule — performing a dynamic rewrite of the URI path — using the [Update a zone ruleset](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/rulesets/methods/update/) operation. The response will contain the complete definition of the ruleset you updated.
