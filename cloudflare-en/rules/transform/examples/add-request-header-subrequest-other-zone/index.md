# Add a request header for subrequests from other zones

Create a request header transform rule to add an HTTP header when the Workers subrequest comes from a different zone.

Last updated Oct 13, 2025|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/transform/examples/add-request-header-subrequest-other-zone/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

The following request header transform rule adds an HTTP header to Workers subrequests coming from a different zone:

Text in **Expression Editor** (replace `myappexample.com` with your domain):

```txt
(cf.worker.upstream_zone != "" and cf.worker.upstream_zone != "myappexample.com")
```

Selected operation under **Modify request header**: _Set static_

**Header name**: `X-External-Workers-Subrequest`

**Value**: `1`

The [cf.worker.upstream\_zone](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/rules-language/fields/reference/cf.worker.upstream%5Fzone/) field used in the rule expression is set to empty if the current request is not a Workers subrequest.
