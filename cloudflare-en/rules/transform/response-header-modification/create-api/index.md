# Create a response header transform rule via API

Last updated May 5, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/transform/response-header-modification/create-api/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Use the [Rulesets API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/rulesets-api/) to create Response Header Transform Rules via API. Refer to the [Rules examples gallery](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/transform/examples/?operation=Response+modification) for common use cases.

If you are using Terraform, refer to [Transform Rules configuration using Terraform](https://developers.cloudflare.com/terraform/additional-configurations/transform-rules/#create-a-response-header-transform-rule).

## Basic rule settings

When creating a response header transform rule via API, make sure you:

* Set the rule action to `rewrite`.
* Define the [header modification parameters](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/transform/request-header-modification/reference/parameters/) in the `action_parameters` field according to the operation to perform (set, add, or remove header).
* Deploy the rule to the `http_response_headers_transform` phase at the zone level.

## Procedure

Follow this workflow to create a response header transform rule for a given zone via API:

1. Use the [List zone rulesets](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/rulesets/methods/list/) operation to check if there is already a ruleset for the `http_response_headers_transform` phase at the zone level.
2. If the phase ruleset does not exist, create it using the [Create a zone ruleset](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/rulesets/methods/create/) operation. In the new ruleset properties, set the following values:

  * **kind**: `zone`
  * **phase**: `http_response_headers_transform`
3. Use the [Update a zone ruleset](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/rulesets/methods/update/) operation to add a response header transform rule to the list of ruleset rules. Alternatively, include the rule in the [Create a zone ruleset](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/rulesets/methods/create/) request mentioned in the previous step.

Make sure your API token has the [required permissions](#required-api-token-permissions) to perform the API operations.

## Example requests

Example: Set an HTTP response header to a static value

The following example configures the rules of an existing phase ruleset (`$RULESET_ID`) to a single response header transform rule — setting an HTTP response header to a static value — using the [Update a zone ruleset](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/rulesets/methods/update/) operation. The response will contain the complete definition of the ruleset you updated.

Use the `ref` field to get stable rule IDs across updates when using Terraform. Adding this field prevents Terraform from recreating the rule on changes. For more information, refer to [Troubleshooting](https://developers.cloudflare.com/terraform/troubleshooting/rule-id-changes/#how-to-keep-the-same-rule-id-between-modifications) in the Terraform documentation.

Example: Set an HTTP response header to a dynamic value

The following example configures the rules of an existing phase ruleset (`$RULESET_ID`) to a single response header transform rule — setting an HTTP response header to a dynamic value — using the [Update a zone ruleset](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/rulesets/methods/update/) operation. The response will contain the complete definition of the ruleset you updated.

Example: Add a `set-cookie` HTTP response header with a static value

The following example configures the rules of an existing phase ruleset (`$RULESET_ID`) to a single response header transform rule — adding a `set-cookie` HTTP response header with a static value — using the [Update a zone ruleset](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/rulesets/methods/update/) operation. By configuring the rule with the `add` operation you will keep any existing `set-cookie` headers that may already exist in the response. The response will contain the complete definition of the ruleset you updated.
