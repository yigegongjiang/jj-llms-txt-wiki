# Single Redirects

Last updated May 5, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/url-forwarding/single-redirects/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Single Redirects allow you to create static or dynamic URL redirects. Static redirects send users to a fixed target URL, while dynamic redirects build the target URL from components of the original request. A [wildcard-based](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/rules-language/operators/#wildcard-matching) interface allows you to define source and target URL patterns without complex functions or regular expressions, efficiently handling thousands of URLs with a single rule. Dynamic URL redirects also support advanced features such as string replacement operations and [regular expressions](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/rules-language/values/#string-values-and-regular-expressions) (depending on your Cloudflare plan).

For more complex and customized redirect logic, consider using [Snippets](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/snippets/).
