# Single Redirects settings

Last updated May 5, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/url-forwarding/single-redirects/settings/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

The following sections describe the settings of redirect rules to configure static and dynamic URL redirects.

## Wildcard URL Redirect

Performs a URL redirect using [wildcard patterns](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/rules-language/operators/#wildcard-matching) to match multiple requests. This method simplifies defining source and target URL patterns without needing complex expressions.

A wildcard URL redirect has the following configuration parameters:

* **Request URL**: Enter the [wildcard pattern](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/rules-language/operators/#wildcard-matching) using the asterisk (`*`) character to match multiple requests. For example, `https://*.example.com/files/*`.
* **Target URL**: Enter the target URL, which can be static (for example, `https://example.com`) or dynamic (for example, `https://example.com/${1}/files/${2}`). Use [wildcard replacement](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/rules-language/functions/#wildcard%5Freplace) like `${1}`, `${2}`, etc., to define dynamic targets.
* **Status code**: The HTTP status code of the redirect response (_301 - Permanent Redirect_ by default). Must be one of the following:

  * **301 - Permanent Redirect**: The page has permanently moved to a new address. For `POST` requests, the client or browser might switch the HTTP method to `GET` when following the redirect.
  * **302 - Temporary Redirect**: The page has temporarily moved to a new address. For `POST` requests, the client or browser might switch the HTTP method to `GET` when following the redirect.
  * **307 - Advanced: Temporary, HTTP method preserved**: The page has temporarily moved to a new address. The client or browser must preserve the original HTTP method (for example, `POST`) when following the redirect.
  * **308 - Advanced: Permanent, HTTP method preserved**: The page has permanently moved to a new address. The client or browser must preserve the original HTTP method (for example, `POST`) when following the redirect.
* **Preserve query string**: Whether to preserve the query string when redirecting (disabled by default).

API information

Wildcard URL redirects are regular [dynamic URL redirects](#dynamic-url-redirect) that use the [wildcard\_replace()](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/rules-language/functions/#wildcard%5Freplace) function in the `target_url.expression` parameter.

The full syntax of the `"action_parameters"` field for a redirect rule performing a wildcard URL redirect is the following:

```json
"action_parameters": {
  "from_value": {
    "target_url": {
      "expression": "wildcard_replace(http.request.full_uri, r\"<REQUEST_URL_PATTERN>\", r\"<TARGET_URL_PATTERN>\")"
    },
    "status_code": <STATUS_CODE>,
    "preserve_query_string": <BOOLEAN_VALUE>
  }
}
```

The required parameters are `<REQUEST_URL_PATTERN>` and `<TARGET_URL_PATTERN>`.

The optional parameters can have the following values:

* `"status_code"` (integer):  
  * `301` (permanent redirect)
  * `302` (temporary redirect)
  * `307` (temporary redirect, preserving original HTTP method)
  * `308` (permanent redirect, preserving original HTTP method)
* `"preserve_query_string"` (boolean): `true` or `false`

## Static URL redirect

Performs a static URL redirect with a given HTTP status code and optionally preserves the query string.

A static URL redirect has the following configuration parameters:

* **URL**: A literal string that will be used in the `Location` HTTP header returned in the redirect response.
* **Status code**: The HTTP status code of the redirect response (_301 - Permanent Redirect_ by default). Must be one of the following:

  * **301 - Permanent Redirect**: The page has permanently moved to a new address. For `POST` requests, the client or browser might switch the HTTP method to `GET` when following the redirect.
  * **302 - Temporary Redirect**: The page has temporarily moved to a new address. For `POST` requests, the client or browser might switch the HTTP method to `GET` when following the redirect.
  * **307 - Advanced: Temporary, HTTP method preserved**: The page has temporarily moved to a new address. The client or browser must preserve the original HTTP method (for example, `POST`) when following the redirect.
  * **308 - Advanced: Permanent, HTTP method preserved**: The page has permanently moved to a new address. The client or browser must preserve the original HTTP method (for example, `POST`) when following the redirect.
* **Preserve query string**: Whether to preserve the query string when redirecting (disabled by default).

API information

The full syntax of the `"action_parameters"` field for a redirect rule performing a static URL redirect is the following:

```json
"action_parameters": {
  "from_value": {
    "target_url": {
      "value": "<STATIC_URL_VALUE>"
    },
    "status_code": <STATUS_CODE>,
    "preserve_query_string": <BOOLEAN_VALUE>
  }
}
```

The only required parameter is `<STATIC_URL_VALUE>`.

The optional parameters can have the following values:

* `"status_code"` (integer):  
  * `301` (permanent redirect)
  * `302` (temporary redirect)
  * `307` (temporary redirect, preserving original HTTP method)
  * `308` (permanent redirect, preserving original HTTP method)
* `"preserve_query_string"` (boolean): `true` or `false`

## Dynamic URL redirect

Performs a dynamic URL redirect, where the target URL is determined by an expression. You can configure the redirect HTTP status code and whether to preserve the query string when redirecting.

A dynamic URL redirect has the following configuration parameters:

* **Expression**: An [expression](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/rules-language/expressions/) that defines the target URL of the redirect. The result of evaluating this expression will be used in the `Location` HTTP header returned in the redirect response. Refer to the [fields](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/rules-language/fields/reference/) and [functions](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/rules-language/functions/) you can use in expressions.
* **Status code**: The HTTP status code of the redirect response (_301 - Permanent Redirect_ by default). Must be one of the following:

  * **301 - Permanent Redirect**: The page has permanently moved to a new address. For `POST` requests, the client or browser might switch the HTTP method to `GET` when following the redirect.
  * **302 - Temporary Redirect**: The page has temporarily moved to a new address. For `POST` requests, the client or browser might switch the HTTP method to `GET` when following the redirect.
  * **307 - Advanced: Temporary, HTTP method preserved**: The page has temporarily moved to a new address. The client or browser must preserve the original HTTP method (for example, `POST`) when following the redirect.
  * **308 - Advanced: Permanent, HTTP method preserved**: The page has permanently moved to a new address. The client or browser must preserve the original HTTP method (for example, `POST`) when following the redirect.
* **Preserve query string**: Whether to preserve the query string when redirecting (disabled by default).

API information

The full syntax of the `"action_parameters"` field for a redirect rule performing a dynamic URL redirect is the following:

```json
"action_parameters": {
  "from_value": {
    "target_url": {
      "expression": "<DYNAMIC_URL_EXPRESSION>"
    },
    "status_code": <STATUS_CODE>,
    "preserve_query_string": <BOOLEAN_VALUE>
  }
}
```

The only required parameter is `<DYNAMIC_URL_EXPRESSION>`.

The optional parameters can have the following values:

* `"status_code"` (integer):  
  * `301` (permanent redirect)
  * `302` (temporary redirect)
  * `307` (temporary redirect, preserving original HTTP method)
  * `308` (permanent redirect, preserving original HTTP method)
* `"preserve_query_string"` (boolean): `true` or `false`
