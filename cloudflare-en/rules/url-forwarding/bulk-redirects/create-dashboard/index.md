# Create Bulk Redirects in the dashboard

Last updated May 5, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/url-forwarding/bulk-redirects/create-dashboard/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

To create Bulk Redirects in the Cloudflare dashboard you must:

1. Create a Bulk Redirect List with one or more URL redirects.
2. Create a Bulk Redirect Rule to enable the URL redirects in the list.

You can create Bulk Redirect Lists and Bulk Redirect Rules in the Cloudflare dashboard:

* At the account level, in **Bulk redirects**.
* At the zone level, go to **Rules** \> **Settings** and select the **Bulk Redirects** tab.

However, the lists and rules only exist at the account level and every zone in the same account will show the same items.

Note

Bulk Redirects require that the incoming traffic for the hostname referenced in visitors' requests is [proxied by Cloudflare](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/proxy-status/).

## 1\. Create a Bulk Redirect List

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Bulk redirects** page.  
[Go to **Bulk redirects** ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/bulk-redirects)
2. Under **Bulk Redirect Lists**, select **Create Bulk Redirect List**.
3. Enter a list name and description, and select **Next**.
4. You can import a CSV file containing several URL redirects or enter URL redirects one at a time in the dashboard.  
Note  
The source URL of each redirect cannot include a query string. For more information, refer to the [supported URL components](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/url-forwarding/bulk-redirects/reference/url-components/).  
Import a CSV file

  1. Drag and drop a CSV file containing URL redirects or select **browse** and select a CSV file. For more information on the file format, refer to [CSV file format for Bulk Redirects](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/url-forwarding/bulk-redirects/reference/csv-file-format/).
  2. The dashboard will display the URL redirects that were successfully imported from the file. You can manually adjust the displayed records or add/remove URL redirects before proceeding.
  3. Select **Next**.  
Add URL redirects manually

  1. Select **Or, manually add URL redirects**.
  2. Enter the URL redirects you wish to add to the list. You must enter at least the following three fields: **Source URL**, **Target URL**, and **Status**. To set additional options, expand **Edit parameters**.
  3. Add more URL redirects, if required.
  4. Select **Next**.
5. Review and edit the URL redirects you imported or created, and select **Next**.
6. Select **Continue to Redirect Rules** to go to the rule creation page, and follow the instructions in the next section. You must create a Bulk Redirect Rule to enable the URL redirects you defined.

Notes

Cloudflare will apply the following rules when you add items to an existing list (either manually or via CSV file):

* Do not remove any existing list items before updating/adding items.
* Update items that were already in the list.
* Add items that were not present in the list.

## 2\. Create a Bulk Redirect Rule

1. (Optional) If you are not using the Bulk Redirect List creation wizard according to the instructions in the previous section:

  1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Bulk redirects** page.  
  [Go to **Bulk redirects** ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/bulk-redirects)
  2. Select **Create Bulk Redirect Rule**.
2. In **Rule name**, enter a descriptive name for the rule.
3. Select the Bulk Redirect List you previously created.
4. (Optional) If necessary, select **Or use the expression editor** to edit the [rule expression](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/url-forwarding/bulk-redirects/concepts/#expression) or the [rule key](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/url-forwarding/bulk-redirects/concepts/#key).
5. To save and deploy the Bulk Redirect Rule, select **Save and Deploy**. If you are not ready to deploy your rule, select **Save as Draft**.  
If you are matching a hostname in your rule expression, you may be prompted to create a proxied DNS record for that hostname. Refer to [Troubleshooting](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/reference/troubleshooting/#this-rule-may-not-apply-to-your-traffic) for more information.
