# Redirect requests from one country to a domain

Create a redirect rule to redirect all website visitors from the United Kingdom to a different domain, maintaining the current functionality in the same paths.

In this example, all website visitors from the United Kingdom will be redirected to a different domain, but maintaining current functionality in the same paths.

1. Create a Bulk Redirect List named `uk_redirect_list` with the following URL redirect:

  * **Source URL**: `https://example.com/`
  * **Target URL**: `https://example.co.uk/`
  * **Subpath matching**: Enabled
  * **Preserve query string**: Enabled
2. Create a Bulk Redirect Rule that enables the previous Bulk Redirect List and set the rule expression to the following:  
```txt  
ip.src.country == "GB" and http.request.full_uri in $uk_redirect_list  
```

This configuration will perform the following redirects for UK visitors:

| Request URL                             | URL after redirect                        |
| --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| https://example.com/                    | https://example.co.uk/                    |
| https://example.com/my/path/to/page.htm | https://example.co.uk/my/path/to/page.htm |
| https://example.com/search?q=term       | https://example.co.uk/search?q=term       |
