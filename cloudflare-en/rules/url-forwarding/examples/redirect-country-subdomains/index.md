# Redirect local visitors to specific subdomains

Create a redirect rule to redirect United Kingdom and France visitors from the `example.com` website's root path (`/`) to their localized subdomains `https://gb.example.com` and `https://fr.example.com`, respectively.

This example single redirect for zone `example.com` will redirect United Kingdom and France visitors requesting the website's root path (`/`) to their localized subdomains `https://gb.example.com` and `https://fr.example.com`, respectively.

**When incoming requests match**

Using the Expression Editor:  
`(ip.src.country eq "GB" or ip.src.country eq "FR") and http.request.uri.path eq "/"`

**Then**

* **Type:** _Dynamic_
* **Expression:** `lower(concat("https://", ip.src.country, ".example.com"))`
* **Status code:** _301_

For example, the redirect rule would perform the following redirects:

| Visitor country | Request URL | Target URL             | Status code |
| --------------- | ----------- | ---------------------- | ----------- |
| United Kingdom  | example.com | https://gb.example.com | 301         |
| France          | example.com | https://fr.example.com | 301         |
| United States   | example.com | (unchanged)            | n/a         |
