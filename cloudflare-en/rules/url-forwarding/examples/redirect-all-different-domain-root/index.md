# Redirect requests for a domain to a new domain

Create a redirect rule to redirect all URLs for a domain to point to the root of a new domain, including any subdomains of the old domain.

Last updated May 5, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/url-forwarding/examples/redirect-all-different-domain-root/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

In this example, an old website was discontinued and replaced by a new one in a different domain. The functionality is different, and all URLs should now point to the root of the new domain. The same applies to any subdomains of the old domain.

[Create a redirect rule](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/url-forwarding/single-redirects/create-dashboard/) with the following configuration:

**When incoming requests match**

* **Wildcard pattern**  
  * **Request URL**: `http*://*example.com/*`

**Then**

* **Target URL**: `https://example.net/`
* **Status code:** _301_

For example, the redirect rule would perform the following redirects:

| Request URL                             | Target URL           | Status code |
| --------------------------------------- | -------------------- | ----------- |
| http://example.com/                     | https://example.net/ | 301         |
| https://example.com/                    | https://example.net/ | 301         |
| https://subdomain.example.com/          | https://example.net/ | 301         |
| https://example.com/my/path/to/page.htm | https://example.net/ | 301         |
| https://example.com/search?q=term       | https://example.net/ | 301         |
