# Redirect visitors to a new page URL

Create a redirect rule to redirect visitors from `/contact-us/` to the page's new path `/contacts/`.

Last updated May 5, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/url-forwarding/examples/redirect-new-url/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

This example static redirect for zone `example.com` will redirect visitors requesting the `/contact-us/` page to the new page URL `/contacts/`.

**When incoming requests match**

* **Field:** _URI Path_
* **Operator:** _equals_
* **Value:** `/contact-us/`

If you are using the Expression Editor, enter the following expression:  
`http.request.uri.path eq "/contact-us/"`

**Then**

* **Type:** _Static_
* **URL:** `/contacts/`
* **Status code:** _301_
* **Preserve query string:** Enabled

For example, the redirect rule would perform the following redirects:

| Request URL                      | Target URL                     | Status code |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ----------- |
| example.com/contact-us/          | example.com/contacts/          | 301         |
| example.com/contact-us/?state=TX | example.com/contacts/?state=TX | 301         |
| example.com/team/                | (unchanged)                    | n/a         |
