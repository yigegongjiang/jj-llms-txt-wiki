# Configure a Cloud Connector rule in the dashboard

Last updated Apr 16, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/cloud-connector/create-dashboard/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

To configure a Cloud Connector rule in the dashboard:

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Cloud Connector** page.  
[Go to **Cloud Connector** ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/:zone/rules/cloud-connector)
2. Select your [cloud provider](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/cloud-connector/providers/) (Cloudflare R2 or an external provider).
3. If you selected Cloudflare R2 in the previous step, select your bucket and your custom domain, and select **Next**.  
If you selected a different storage provider, enter the bucket URL and select **Next**.  
Caution  
The bucket URL must follow a [specific format](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/cloud-connector/providers/) according to your provider.
4. Enter a descriptive name for the rule in **Cloud Connector name**.
5. Under **If**, select **Custom filter expression** and [enter an expression](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/rules-language/expressions/edit-expressions/) to define the traffic that will be redirected to the bucket. For example:

  * To route all requests matching `http*://example.com/images/*` (HTTPS and HTTP requests) you could enter the following expression:  
  `http.request.full_uri wildcard "http*://example.com/images/*"`
  * To route all requests matching `http*://images.example.com/*` (HTTPS and HTTP requests) you could enter the following expression:  
  `http.request.full_uri wildcard "http*://images.example.com/*"`  
Alternatively, select **All incoming requests** to redirect all incoming traffic for your zone to the storage bucket you selected.
6. To save and deploy your rule, select **Deploy**. If you are not ready to deploy the rule, select **Save as Draft**.  
If you are matching a hostname in your rule expression, you may be prompted to create a proxied DNS record for that hostname. Refer to [Troubleshooting](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/reference/troubleshooting/#this-rule-may-not-apply-to-your-traffic) for more information.
