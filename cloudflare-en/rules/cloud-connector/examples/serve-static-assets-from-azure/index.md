# Serve /static-assets from Azure Blob Storage

Route requests with a URI path starting with `/static-assets` to an Azure Blob Storage container using Cloud Connector.

To serve static assets from an Azure Blob Storage container:

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Cloud Connector** page.  
[Go to **Cloud Connector** ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/:zone/rules/cloud-connector)
2. Select **Microsoft Azure** as your [cloud provider](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/cloud-connector/providers/).
3. Enter the bucket URL. Use the following URL structure:

  * **Subdomain-style URL**: Set the hostname to `<BUCKET_NAME>.blob.core.windows.net`. In this case, your bucket should include a folder named `static-assets`, and files should be placed inside this folder. For example, `https://<YOUR_HOSTNAME>/static-assets/style.css` will map to `https://<BUCKET_NAME>.blob.core.windows.net/static-assets/style.css`.
4. (Optional) Use [URL Rewrite Rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/transform/url-rewrite/) to adjust the URL structure. For example, you can [create a URL rewrite](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/transform/url-rewrite/create-dashboard/) that changes `/static-assets` to `/my-pages-project/static-assets` to match the file structure of your object storage bucket.
5. (Optional) Use [Cache Rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cache/how-to/cache-rules/) to adjust the caching behavior for objects returned from the bucket. For example, you can [create a cache rule](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cache/how-to/cache-rules/create-dashboard/) that caches every returned object matching the `/static-assets` URI path for seven days (defined through the **Edge TTL** setting).
6. Click **Next** and enter a descriptive name like `Serve static assets from Azure` in **Cloud Connector name**.
7. Under **If**, select **Custom filter expression** and enter the following expression: `http.request.full_uri wildcard "http*://<YOUR_HOSTNAME>/static-assets/*"`
8. Select **Deploy** to activate the rule.

This setup ensures that all traffic matching `http*://<YOUR_HOSTNAME>/static-assets/*` (HTTPS and HTTP requests) is served from your Azure Blob Storage container. Make sure to replace `<YOUR_HOSTNAME>` with your actual hostname and adjust the example paths according to your setup.
