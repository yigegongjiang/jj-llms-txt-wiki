# Change the destination port

Create an origin rule to change the destination port.

Last updated Oct 13, 2025|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/origin-rules/examples/change-port/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

The following origin rule overrides the destination port to `8081` for all requests where the URI path starts with `/team/calendar/`.

Text in Expression Editor:

```txt
starts_with(http.request.uri.path, "/team/calendar/")
```

Value after **Destination Port** \> **Rewrite to**:

```txt
8081
```

The following example sets the rules of an existing phase ruleset (`$RULESET_ID`) to a single origin rule — overriding the port of incoming requests — using the [Update a zone ruleset](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/rulesets/methods/update/) operation. The response will contain the complete definition of the ruleset you updated.

	}'

		"phase": "http_request_origin"
	},
	"success": true,
	"errors": [],
	"messages": []
}
```

Use the `ref` field to get stable rule IDs across updates when using Terraform. Adding this field prevents Terraform from recreating the rule on changes. For more information, refer to [Troubleshooting](https://developers.cloudflare.com/terraform/troubleshooting/rule-id-changes/#how-to-keep-the-same-rule-id-between-modifications) in the Terraform documentation.
