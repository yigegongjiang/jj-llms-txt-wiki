# Change the HTTP Host header and DNS record

Create an origin rule to change the HTTP `Host` header and DNS record.

Last updated May 5, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/origin-rules/examples/change-http-host-header/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

The following origin rule overrides the HTTP `Host` header to `hr-server.example.com` for all requests with a URI path starting with `/hr-app/`. It also overrides the DNS record to the same hostname.

The `Host` header override only updates the header value; the DNS record override will handle the rerouting of incoming requests. For more information on these overrides, refer to [Origin Rules settings](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/origin-rules/features/).

Expression when using the Expression Builder:

| Field    | Operator    | Value    |
| -------- | ----------- | -------- |
| URI Path | starts with | /hr-app/ |

Expression when using the Expression Editor:

```txt
(starts_with(http.request.uri.path, "/hr-app/"))
```

Value after **Host Header** \> **Rewrite to**:

```txt
hr-server.example.com
```

Value after **DNS Record** \> **Override to**:

```txt
hr-server.example.com
```

The following example sets the rules of an existing phase ruleset (`$RULESET_ID`) to a single origin rule — overriding the `Host` header of incoming requests and the resolved DNS record — using the [Update a zone ruleset](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/rulesets/methods/update/) operation. The response will contain the complete definition of the ruleset you updated.

Use the `ref` field to get stable rule IDs across updates when using Terraform. Adding this field prevents Terraform from recreating the rule on changes. For more information, refer to [Troubleshooting](https://developers.cloudflare.com/terraform/troubleshooting/rule-id-changes/#how-to-keep-the-same-rule-id-between-modifications) in the Terraform documentation.
