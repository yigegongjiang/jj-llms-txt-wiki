# Create an origin rule via API

Last updated Apr 16, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/origin-rules/create-api/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Use the [Rulesets API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/rulesets-api/) to create origin rules via API.

## Basic rule settings

When creating an origin rule via API, make sure you:

* Set the rule action to `route`.
* Define the [parameters](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/origin-rules/parameters/) in the `action_parameters` field according to the type of origin override.
* Deploy the rule to the `http_request_origin` phase at the zone level.

## Procedure

Follow this workflow to create an origin rule for a given zone via API:

1. Use the [List zone rulesets](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/rulesets/methods/list/) operation to check if there is already a ruleset for the `http_request_origin` phase at the zone level.
2. If the phase ruleset does not exist, create it using the [Create a zone ruleset](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/rulesets/methods/create/) operation. In the new ruleset properties, set the following values:

  * **kind**: `zone`
  * **phase**: `http_request_origin`
3. Use the [Update a zone ruleset](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/rulesets/methods/update/) operation to add an origin rule to the list of ruleset rules. Alternatively, include the rule in the [Create a zone ruleset](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/rulesets/methods/create/) request mentioned in the previous step.

Make sure your API token has the [required permissions](#required-api-token-permissions) to perform the API operations.

## Example requests

Example: Add a rule that overrides the `Host` header of incoming requests and the resolved DNS record

The following example sets the rules of an existing phase ruleset (`$RULESET_ID`) to a single origin rule — overriding the `Host` header of incoming requests and the resolved DNS record — using the [Update a zone ruleset](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/rulesets/methods/update/) operation. The response will contain the complete definition of the ruleset you updated.

Required API token permissions

At least one of the following [token permissions](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/reference/permissions/) is required:
* `Response Compression Write`
* `Config Settings Write`
* `Dynamic URL Redirects Write`
* `Cache Settings Write`
* `Custom Errors Write`
* `Origin Write`
* `Managed headers Write`
* `Zone Transform Rules Write`
* `Mass URL Redirects Write`
* `Magic Firewall Write`
* `L4 DDoS Managed Ruleset Write`
* `HTTP DDoS Managed Ruleset Write`
* `Sanitize Write`
* `Transform Rules Write`
* `Select Configuration Write`
* `Bot Management Write`
* `Zone WAF Write`
* `Account WAF Write`
* `Account Rulesets Write`
* `Logs Write`
* `Logs Write`

```bash
curl "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/$ZONE_ID/rulesets/$RULESET_ID" \

				}
		]
	}'
```

```json

			}
		],
		"last_updated": "2022-06-03T14:42:04.219025Z",
		"phase": "http_request_origin"
	},
	"success": true,
	"errors": [],
	"messages": []
}
```

Use the `ref` field to get stable rule IDs across updates when using Terraform. Adding this field prevents Terraform from recreating the rule on changes. For more information, refer to [Troubleshooting](https://developers.cloudflare.com/terraform/troubleshooting/rule-id-changes/#how-to-keep-the-same-rule-id-between-modifications) in the Terraform documentation.

Example: Add a rule that overrides the port of incoming requests

The following example sets the rules of an existing phase ruleset (`$RULESET_ID`) to a single origin rule — overriding the port of incoming requests — using the [Update a zone ruleset](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/rulesets/methods/update/) operation.
