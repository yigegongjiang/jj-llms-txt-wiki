# Point to R2 bucket with a custom domain

Last updated Oct 13, 2025|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/origin-rules/tutorials/point-to-r2-bucket-with-custom-domain/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

This tutorial will instruct you how to configure an origin rule and a DNS record to point to an R2 bucket configured with a custom domain.

The procedure will use the following example values:

| URL that website visitors will access | mycustomerexample.com/images/\* |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| R2 bucket custom domain               | imagesbucket.example.com        |

When configuring your R2 bucket's custom domain, use a custom domain that you do not plan to use in production (`imagesbucket.example.com` in this example).

## 1\. Configure custom domain in your Pages project

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **R2 object storage** page.  
[Go to **Overview** ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/r2/overview)
2. Select your bucket.
3. On the bucket page, select **Settings**.
4. Under **Public access** \> **Custom Domains**, select **Connect Domain**.
5. Enter the domain name you want to connect to — `imagesbucket.example.com` in this example — and select **Continue**.
6. Review the new record that will be added to the DNS table and select **Connect Domain**.

Your domain is now connected. The status takes a few minutes to change from **Initializing** to **Active**, and you may need to refresh to review the status update. If the status has not changed, select the **...** next to your bucket and select **Retry connection**.

To view the added DNS record, select **...** next to the connected domain and select **Manage DNS**.

Note

The domain used must belong to the same account as the R2 bucket.

## 2\. Create origin rule to rewrite host header and override DNS record

In your `mycustomerexample.com` zone, create an origin rule with the following configuration:

**If incoming requests match**

| Field    | Operator | Value      |
| -------- | -------- | ---------- |
| URI Path | wildcard | /images/\* |

If using the Expression Editor, enter the following expression:

```txt
(http.request.uri.path wildcard "/images/*")
```

**Set origin parameters**

* Value after **Host header** \> **Rewrite to**: `imagesbucket.example.com`
* Value after **DNS record** \> **Override to**: `imagesbucket.example.com`

## 3\. (Optional) Configure URL rewrite

In our example, the URL that website visitors will access starts with `/images`. However, images stored in the example R2 bucket do not have this initial URL segment.

Use a URL rewrite to remove the `/images` segment from the URL path. Cloudflare provides a rule template in the dashboard called **Rewrite Path for Object Storage Bucket** that you can use to configure the required rewrite.

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the Rules **Overview** page.  
[Go to **Overview** ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/:zone/rules/overview)
2. Select **Create rule** \> **URL Rewrite Rule**.
3. Enter a descriptive name for the rule in **Rule name**.
4. In **If incoming requests match**, select **Wildcard pattern**.
5. Enter the following value in **Request URL**:  
```txt  
https://<YOUR_HOSTNAME>/images/*  
```  
In the current example, the value would be `https://mycustomerexample.com/images/*`.
6. In **Then rewrite the path and/or query**, enter the following values under **Path**:

| Target path     | Rewrite to |
| --------------- | ---------- |
| \[/\] images/\* | \[/\] ${1} |
7. Select **Deploy**.

Note

Cloudflare provides a rule template in the dashboard called **Rewrite Path for Object Storage Bucket** that you can use and adapt to configure the URL rewrite rule.
