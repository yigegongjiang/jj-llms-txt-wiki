**Bot management fields and ASN support in Cache Rules**  

#### Bot management fields and ASN support in Cache Rules

Cache Rules now supports bot management fields and the `ip.src.asnum` field in expression filters. You can now build cache policies that differentiate between automated and human traffic, or segment caching behavior by autonomous system number (ASN).

This allows you to apply different caching strategies for verified bots, high-risk traffic, or specific network operators without affecting legitimate user requests. For example, you can set shorter cache TTLs for suspected bot traffic or bypass cache entirely for requests from specific ASNs.

#### New fields

The following fields are now available in Cache Rules expressions:

| Field                                   | Type    | Description                                                                                                       |
| --------------------------------------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| cf.bot\_management.score                | Number  | Bot score from 1 to 99, where a lower value indicates a higher likelihood that the request originates from a bot. |
| cf.bot\_management.ja3\_hash            | String  | JA3 fingerprint of the request, which helps identify the client making the connection.                            |
| cf.bot\_management.ja4                  | String  | JA4 fingerprint of the request, which provides a more detailed client identification than JA3.                    |
| cf.bot\_management.verified\_bot        | Boolean | Whether the request originates from a verified bot, such as a search engine crawler.                              |
| cf.bot\_management.static\_resource     | Boolean | Whether the request is for a static resource and therefore exempt from bot detection.                             |
| cf.bot\_management.js\_detection.passed | Boolean | Whether the browser passed JavaScript detection when the feature is enabled.                                      |
| cf.bot\_management.attack\_score        | Number  | Classifies the request by attack score, from 1 (likely automated) to 99 (likely human).                           |
| cf.bot\_management.api\_score           | Number  | Classifies the request by API score, from 1 (likely automated) to 99 (likely human).                              |
| cf.bot\_management.bot\_tags\["<TAG>"\] | Boolean | Whether the bot traffic matches the specified tag, such as google or bing.                                        |
| cf.bot\_management.corporate\_proxy     | Boolean | Whether the request originates from a known corporate proxy.                                                      |
| ip.src.asnum                            | Number  | The autonomous system number (ASN) of the incoming request's IP address.                                          |

Note

Bot management fields require a Bot Management subscription. `ip.src.asnum` is available on all plans.

#### Example

Cache Rules expressions support combining these fields with other criteria. The following example sets a shorter cache TTL for API requests that originate from a high-risk bot or an unexpected ASN:

```txt
(http.request.uri.path contains "/api/" and cf.bot_management.score lt 30)
or
(http.request.uri.path contains "/api/" and not ip.src.asnum in {12345 67890})
```

**New QUIC RTT and delivery rate fields**  

Two new fields are now available in rule expressions that surface Layer 4 transport telemetry from the client connection. Together with the existing [cf.timings.client\_tcp\_rtt\_msec](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/rules-language/fields/reference/) field, these fields give you a complete picture of connection quality for both TCP and QUIC traffic — enabling transport-aware rules without requiring any client-side changes.

Previously, QUIC RTT and delivery rate data was only available via the `Server-Timing: cfL4` response header. These new fields make the same data available directly in rule expressions, so you can use them in Transform Rules, WAF Custom Rules, and other phases that support dynamic fields.

#### New fields

| Field                              | Type    | Description                                                                                                                                                             |
| ---------------------------------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| cf.timings.client\_quic\_rtt\_msec | Integer | The smoothed QUIC round-trip time (RTT) between Cloudflare and the client in milliseconds. Only populated for QUIC (HTTP/3) connections. Returns 0 for TCP connections. |
| cf.edge.l4.delivery\_rate          | Integer | The most recent data delivery rate estimate for the client connection, in bytes per second. Returns 0 when L4 statistics are not available for the request.             |

#### Example: Route slow connections to a lightweight origin

Use a request header transform rule to tag requests from high-latency connections, so your origin can serve a lighter page variant:

**Rule expression:**

```txt
cf.timings.client_tcp_rtt_msec > 200 or cf.timings.client_quic_rtt_msec > 200
```

**Header modifications:**

| Operation | Header name    | Value |
| --------- | -------------- | ----- |
| Set       | X-High-Latency | true  |

#### Example: Match low-bandwidth connections

```txt
cf.edge.l4.delivery_rate > 0 and cf.edge.l4.delivery_rate < 100000
```

For more information, refer to [Request Header Transform Rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/transform/request-header-modification/) and the [fields reference](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/rules-language/fields/reference/).

## 2026-03-25

  
**New mTLS certificate fields for Transform Rules**  

Cloudflare now exposes four new fields in the Transform Rules phase that encode client certificate data in [RFC 9440 ↗](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9440) format. Previously, forwarding client certificate information to your origin required custom parsing of PEM-encoded fields or non-standard HTTP header formats. These new fields produce output in the standardized `Client-Cert` and `Client-Cert-Chain` header format defined by RFC 9440, so your origin can consume them directly without any additional decoding logic.

Each certificate is DER-encoded, Base64-encoded, and wrapped in colons. For example, `:MIIDsT...Vw==:`. A chain of intermediates is expressed as a comma-separated list of such values.

#### New fields

| Field                                                 | Type    | Description                                                                                                                                                      |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| cf.tls\_client\_auth.cert\_rfc9440                    | String  | The client leaf certificate in RFC 9440 format. Empty if no client certificate was presented.                                                                    |
| cf.tls\_client\_auth.cert\_rfc9440\_too\_large        | Boolean | true if the leaf certificate exceeded 10 KB and was omitted. In practice this will almost always be false.                                                       |
| cf.tls\_client\_auth.cert\_chain\_rfc9440             | String  | The intermediate certificate chain in RFC 9440 format as a comma-separated list. Empty if no intermediate certificates were sent or if the chain exceeded 16 KB. |
| cf.tls\_client\_auth.cert\_chain\_rfc9440\_too\_large | Boolean | true if the intermediate chain exceeded 16 KB and was omitted.                                                                                                   |

The chain encoding follows the same ordering as the TLS handshake: the certificate closest to the leaf appears first, working up toward the trust anchor. The root certificate is not included.

#### Example: Forwarding client certificate headers to your origin server

Add a request header transform rule to set the `Client-Cert` and `Client-Cert-Chain` headers on requests forwarded to your origin server. For example, to forward headers for verified, non-revoked certificates:

**Rule expression:**

```txt
cf.tls_client_auth.cert_verified and not cf.tls_client_auth.cert_revoked
```

**Header modifications:**

| Operation | Header name       | Value                                     |
| --------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Set       | Client-Cert       | cf.tls\_client\_auth.cert\_rfc9440        |
| Set       | Client-Cert-Chain | cf.tls\_client\_auth.cert\_chain\_rfc9440 |

To get the most out of these fields, upload your client CA certificate to Cloudflare so that Cloudflare validates the client certificate at the edge and populates `cf.tls_client_auth.cert_verified` and `cf.tls_client_auth.cert_revoked`.

Prevent header injection

You should ensure that `Client-Cert` and `Client-Cert-Chain` headers received by your origin server can only originate from this transform rule — any client could send these headers directly.

* **If you use WAF custom rules to block requests with invalid mTLS connections:** The transform rule is sufficient. For all requests that reach your origin server, the rule will overwrite any existing `Client-Cert` and `Client-Cert-Chain` headers.
* **If you do not enforce mTLS at the WAF:** Add another transform rule that removes any incoming `Client-Cert` and `Client-Cert-Chain` headers from all requests (use expression `true`), ordered before the rule above. This ensures your origin server cannot receive client-supplied values for these HTTP headers.

For more information, refer to [Mutual TLS authentication](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/access-controls/service-credentials/mutual-tls-authentication/), [Request Header Transform Rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/transform/request-header-modification/), and the [fields reference](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/rules-language/fields/reference/).

**Worker execution timing field now available in Rules**  

The `cf.timings.worker_msec` field is now available in the Ruleset Engine. This field reports the wall-clock time that a Cloudflare Worker spent handling a request, measured in milliseconds.

You can use this field to identify slow Worker executions, detect performance regressions, or build rules that respond differently based on Worker processing time, such as logging requests that exceed a latency threshold.

#### Field details

| Field                   | Type    | Description                                                                                       |
| ----------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| cf.timings.worker\_msec | Integer | The time spent executing a Cloudflare Worker in milliseconds. Returns 0 if no Worker was invoked. |

Example filter expression:

```plaintext
cf.timings.worker_msec > 500
```

For more information, refer to the [Fields reference](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/rules-language/fields/reference/cf.timings.worker%5Fmsec/).

**Control request and response body buffering in Configuration Rules**  

You can now control how Cloudflare buffers HTTP request and response bodies using two new settings in [Configuration Rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/configuration-rules/).

#### Request body buffering

Controls how Cloudflare buffers HTTP request bodies before forwarding them to your origin server:

| Mode                   | Behavior                                                                                                      |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Standard** (default) | Cloudflare can inspect a prefix of the request body for enabled functionality such as WAF and Bot Management. |
| **Full**               | Buffers the entire request body before sending to origin.                                                     |
| **None**               | No buffering — the request body streams directly to origin without inspection.                                |

#### Response body buffering

Controls how Cloudflare buffers HTTP response bodies before forwarding them to the client:

| Mode                   | Behavior                                                                            |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Standard** (default) | Cloudflare can inspect a prefix of the response body for enabled functionality.     |
| **None**               | No buffering — the response body streams directly to the client without inspection. |

Caution

Setting body buffering to **None** may break security functionality that requires body inspection, including the Web Application Firewall (WAF) and Bot Management. Ensure that any paths where you disable buffering do not require security inspection.

#### API example

```json
{
  "action": "set_config",
  "action_parameters": {
    "request_body_buffering": "standard",
    "response_body_buffering": "none"
  }
}
```

**New cryptographic functions — encode\_base64() and sha256()**  

Cloudflare Rulesets now includes `encode_base64()` and `sha256()` functions, enabling you to generate signed request headers directly in rule expressions. These functions support common patterns like constructing a canonical string from request attributes, computing a SHA256 digest, and Base64-encoding the result.

---

#### New functions

| Function                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Availability                          |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| encode\_base64(input, flags) | Encodes a string to Base64 format. Optional flags parameter: u for URL-safe encoding, p for padding (adds \= characters to make the output length a multiple of 4, as required by some systems). By default, output is standard Base64 without padding. | All plans (in header transform rules) |
| sha256(input)                | Computes a SHA256 hash of the input string.                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Requires enablement                   |

Note

The `sha256()` function is available as an Enterprise add-on and requires a specific entitlement. Contact your account team to enable it.

---

#### Examples

**Encode a string to Base64 format:**

```txt
encode_base64("hello world")
```

Returns: `aGVsbG8gd29ybGQ`

**Encode a string to Base64 format with padding:**

```txt
encode_base64("hello world", "p")
```

Returns: `aGVsbG8gd29ybGQ=`

**Perform a URL-safe Base64 encoding of a string:**

```txt
encode_base64("hello world", "u")
```

Returns: `aGVsbG8gd29ybGQ`

**Compute the SHA256 hash of a secret token:**

```txt
sha256("my-token")
```

Returns a hash that your origin can validate to authenticate requests.

**Compute the SHA256 hash of a string and encode the result to Base64 format:**

```txt
encode_base64(sha256("my-token"))
```

Combines hashing and encoding for systems that expect Base64-encoded signatures.

For more information, refer to the [Functions reference](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/rules-language/functions/).

## 2026-01-20

  
**New functions for array and map operations**  

#### New functions for array and map operations

Cloudflare Rulesets now include new functions that enable advanced expression logic for evaluating arrays and maps. These functions allow you to build rules that match against lists of values in request or response headers, enabling use cases like country-based blocking using custom headers.

---

#### New functions

| Function                 | Description                                                                   |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| split(source, delimiter) | Splits a string into an array of strings using the specified delimiter.       |
| join(array, delimiter)   | Joins an array of strings into a single string using the specified delimiter. |
| has\_key(map, key)       | Returns true if the specified key exists in the map.                          |
| has\_value(map, value)   | Returns true if the specified value exists in the map.                        |

---

#### Example use cases

**Check if a country code exists in a header list:**

```txt
has_value(split(http.response.headers["x-allow-country"][0], ","), ip.src.country)
```

**Check if a specific header key exists:**

```txt
has_key(http.request.headers, "x-custom-header")
```

**Join array values for logging or comparison:**

```txt
join(http.request.headers.names, ", ")
```

For more information, refer to the [Functions reference](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/rules-language/functions/).

## 2026-01-12

  
**Metro code field now available in Rules**  

The `ip.src.metro_code` field in the Ruleset Engine is now populated with DMA (Designated Market Area) data.

You can use this field to build rules that target traffic based on geographic market areas, enabling more granular location-based policies for your applications.

#### Field details

| Field              | Type           | Description                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------ | -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ip.src.metro\_code | String \| null | The metro code (DMA) of the incoming request's IP address. Returns the designated market area code for the client's location. |

Example filter expression:

```plaintext
ip.src.metro_code eq "501"
```

For more information, refer to the [Fields reference](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/rules-language/fields/reference/ip.src.metro%5Fcode/).

## 2025-10-30

  
**New TCP-based fields available in Rulesets**  

#### Build rules based on TCP transport and latency

Cloudflare now provides two new request fields in the Ruleset engine that let you make decisions based on whether a request used TCP and the measured TCP round-trip time between the client and Cloudflare. These fields help you understand protocol usage across your traffic and build policies that respond to network performance. For example, you can distinguish TCP from QUIC traffic or route high latency requests to alternative origins when needed.

---

#### New fields

| Field                             | Type    | Description                                                                                                                                                          |
| --------------------------------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| cf.edge.client\_tcp               | Boolean | Indicates whether the request used TCP. A value of true means the client connected using TCP instead of QUIC.                                                        |
| cf.timings.client\_tcp\_rtt\_msec | Number  | Reports the smoothed TCP round-trip time between the client and Cloudflare in milliseconds. For example, a value of 20 indicates roughly twenty milliseconds of RTT. |

Example filter expression:

```plaintext
cf.edge.client_tcp && cf.timings.client_tcp_rtt_msec < 100
```

More information can be found in the Rules language [fields reference](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/rules-language/fields/reference/).

**More flexible fallback handling — Custom Errors now support fetching assets returned with 4xx or 5xx status codes**  

[Custom Errors](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/custom-errors/) can now fetch and store [assets](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/custom-errors/create-rules/#create-a-custom-error-asset-dashboard) and [error pages](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/custom-errors/#error-pages) from your origin even if they are served with a 4xx or 5xx HTTP status code — previously, only 200 OK responses were allowed.

**What’s new:**

* You can now upload error pages and error assets that return error status codes (for example, 403, 500, 502, 503, 504) when fetched.
* These assets are stored and minified at the edge, so they can be reused across multiple Custom Error rules without triggering requests to the origin.

This is especially useful for retrieving error content or downtime banners from your backend when you can’t override the origin status code.

Learn more in the [Custom Errors](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/custom-errors/) documentation.

## 2025-06-09

  
**Match Workers subrequests by upstream zone — cf.worker.upstream\_zone now supported in Transform Rules**  

You can now use the [cf.worker.upstream\_zone](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/rules-language/fields/reference/cf.worker.upstream%5Fzone/) field in [Transform Rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/transform/) to control rule execution based on whether a request originates from [Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/), including subrequests issued by Workers in other zones.

![Match Workers subrequests by upstream zone in Transform Rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/_astro/transform-rule-subrequest-matching.BeUBEN67_wWefn.webp) 

**What's new:**

* `cf.worker.upstream_zone` is now supported in Transform Rules expressions.
* Skip or apply logic conditionally when handling [Workers subrequests](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/limits/#subrequests).

For example, to add a header when the subrequest comes from another zone:

**Fine-tune image optimization — WebP now supported in Configuration Rules**  

You can now enable [Polish](https://developers.cloudflare.com/images/polish/activate-polish/) with the `webp` format directly in [Configuration Rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/configuration-rules/), allowing you to optimize image delivery for specific routes, user agents, or A/B tests — without applying changes zone-wide.

**What’s new:**

* [WebP](https://developers.cloudflare.com/images/polish/compression/#webp) is now a supported [value](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/configuration-rules/settings/#polish) in the **Polish** setting for Configuration Rules.

This gives you more precise control over how images are compressed and delivered, whether you're targeting modern browsers, running experiments, or tailoring performance by geography or device type.

In Snippets, you can now also match on [Bot Score](https://developers.cloudflare.com/bots/concepts/bot-score/) and [WAF Attack Score](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/detections/attack-score/), unlocking smarter edge logic for everything from request filtering and mitigation to [tarpitting](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/snippets/examples/slow-suspicious-requests/) and logging.

**What’s new:**

* [Custom lists](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/tools/lists/custom-lists/) matching – Snippets and Cloud Connector now support user-created IP, AS, and Hostname lists via dashboard or [Lists API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/rules/subresources/lists/methods/list/). Great for shared logic across zones.
* [Bot Score](https://developers.cloudflare.com/bots/concepts/bot-score/) and [WAF Attack Score](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/detections/attack-score/) – Use Cloudflare’s intelligent traffic signals to detect bots or attacks and take advanced, tailored actions with just a few lines of code.

**Custom Errors (beta): Stored Assets & Account-level Rules**  

We're introducing [Custom Errors](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/custom-errors/) (beta), which builds on our existing Custom Error Responses feature with new asset storage capabilities.

This update allows you to store externally hosted error pages on Cloudflare and reference them in custom error rules, eliminating the need to supply inline content.

This brings the following new capabilities:

* **Custom error assets** – Fetch and store external error pages at the edge for use in error responses.
* **Account-Level custom errors** – Define error handling rules and assets at the account level for consistency across multiple zones. Zone-level rules take precedence over account-level ones, and assets are not shared between levels.

You can use Cloudflare API to upload your existing assets for use with Custom Errors:

```bash
curl "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/{zone_id}/custom_pages/assets" \
--header "Authorization: Bearer <API_TOKEN>" \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
  "name": "maintenance",
  "description": "Maintenance template page",
  "url": "https://example.com/"
}'
```

You can then reference the stored asset in a Custom Error rule:

```bash
curl --request PUT \
"https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/{zone_id}/rulesets/phases/http_custom_errors/entrypoint" \
--header "Authorization: Bearer <API_TOKEN>" \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
  "rules": [
		{
			"action": "serve_error",
			"action_parameters": {
				"asset_name": "maintenance",
				"content_type": "text/html",
				"status_code": 503
			},
			"enabled": true,
			"expression": "http.request.uri.path contains \"error\""
		}
	]
}'
```

resource "cloudflare_snippet" "my_snippet" {
	zone_id  = "<ZONE_ID>"
	name = "my_test_snippet_1"
	main_module = "file1.js"
	files {
		name = "file1.js"
		content = file("file1.js")
	}
}

resource "cloudflare_snippet_rules" "cookie_snippet_rule" {
	zone_id  = "<ZONE_ID>"
	rules {
