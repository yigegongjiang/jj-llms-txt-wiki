```js
export default {
	async fetch(request) {
		// Define an object with the security headers you want to set.
		// Refer to https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/snippets/examples/security-headers/#other-common-security-headers for more options.
		const DEFAULT_SECURITY_HEADERS = {
			"X-Content-Type-Options": "nosniff",
			"Referrer-Policy": "strict-origin-when-cross-origin",
			"Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy": 'require-corp; report-to="default";',
			"Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy": 'same-site; report-to="default";',
			"Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy": "same-site",
		};

		// You can also define headers to be deleted.
		const BLOCKED_HEADERS = [
			"Public-Key-Pins",
			"X-Powered-By",
			"X-AspNet-Version",
		];

		// Receive response from the origin.
		let response = await fetch(request);

		// Create a new Headers object to modify response headers
		let newHeaders = new Headers(response.headers);

		// This sets the headers for HTML responses:
		if (
			newHeaders.has("Content-Type") &&
			!newHeaders.get("Content-Type").includes("text/html")
		) {
			return new Response(response.body, {
				status: response.status,
				statusText: response.statusText,
				headers: newHeaders,
			});
		}

		// Use DEFAULT_SECURITY_HEADERS object defined above to set the new security headers.
		Object.keys(DEFAULT_SECURITY_HEADERS).map((name) => {
			newHeaders.set(name, DEFAULT_SECURITY_HEADERS[name]);
		});

		// Use the BLOCKED_HEADERS object defined above to delete headers you wish to block.
		BLOCKED_HEADERS.forEach((name) => {
			newHeaders.delete(name);
		});

		return new Response(response.body, {
			status: response.status,
			statusText: response.statusText,
			headers: newHeaders,
		});
	},
};
```

## Other common security headers

* Content-Security-Policy headers: Enabling these headers will permit content from a trusted domain and all its subdomains. Refer to [Content-Security-Policy ↗](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Content-Security-Policy) for details.

```js
"Content-Security-Policy": "default-src 'self' example.com *.example.com",
```

* Strict-Transport-Security headers: These are not automatically set because your website might get added to Chrome's HSTS preload list.

```js
"Strict-Transport-Security" : "max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains; preload",
```

* Permissions-Policy header: Allow or deny the use of browser features, such as opting out of FLoC.

```js
"Permissions-Policy": "interest-cohort=()",
```

* X-XSS-Protection header: Prevents a page from loading if an XSS attack is detected. Refer to [X-XSS-Protection ↗](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/X-XSS-Protection) for details.

```js
"X-XSS-Protection": "0",
```

* X-Frame-Options header: Prevents click-jacking attacks. Refer to [X-Frame-Options ↗](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/X-Frame-Options).

```js
"X-Frame-Options": "DENY",
```
