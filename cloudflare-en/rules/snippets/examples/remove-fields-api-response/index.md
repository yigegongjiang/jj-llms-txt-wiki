```js
export default {
	async fetch(request) {
		// Send original request to the origin
		const response = await fetch(request);
		// Check if origin responded with JSON
		try {
			// Parse API response as JSON
			var api_response = response.json();
			// Specify the fields you want to delete. For example, to delete "botManagement" array from parsed JSON:
			delete api_response.botManagement;
			// Serve modified API response
			return Response.json(api_response);
		} catch (err) {
			// On failure, serve unmodified origin's response
			return response;
		}
	},
};
