# Auth with headers

Allow or deny a request based on a known pre-shared key in a header. This is not meant to replace the [WebCrypto API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/web-crypto/).

Caution when using in production

The example code contains a generic header key and value of `X-Custom-PSK` and `mypresharedkey`. To best protect your resources, change the header key and value in the Snippets editor before saving your code.

```js
export default {
	async fetch(request) {
		/**
		 * @param {string} PRESHARED_AUTH_HEADER_KEY Custom header to check for key
		 * @param {string} PRESHARED_AUTH_HEADER_VALUE Hard-coded key value
		 */
		const PRESHARED_AUTH_HEADER_KEY = "X-Custom-PSK";
		const PRESHARED_AUTH_HEADER_VALUE = "mypresharedkey";
		const psk = request.headers.get(PRESHARED_AUTH_HEADER_KEY);

		if (psk === PRESHARED_AUTH_HEADER_VALUE) {
			// Correct preshared header key supplied. Fetch request from origin.
			return fetch(request);
		}

		// Incorrect key supplied. Reject the request.
		return new Response("Sorry, you have supplied an invalid key.", {
			status: 403,
		});
	},
};
```
