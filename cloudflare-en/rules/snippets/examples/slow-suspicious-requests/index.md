## Snippet code

```js
export default {
	async fetch(request) {
		// Define delay
		const delay_in_seconds = 5;
		// Introduce a delay
		await new Promise((resolve) =>
			setTimeout(resolve, delay_in_seconds * 1000),
		); // Set delay in milliseconds

		// Pass the request to the origin
		const response = await fetch(request);
		return response;
	},
};
```

## Snippet rule

Configure a custom filter expression:

| Field     | Operator  | Value |
| --------- | --------- | ----- |
| Bot Score | less than | 10    |

If you are using the Expression Editor, enter the following expression:

```txt
(cf.bot_management.score lt 10)
```
