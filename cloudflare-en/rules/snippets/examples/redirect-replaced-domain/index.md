		// Define variables to use in the response redirect.
		const base = "https://example.com";
		const statusCode = 301;

		// Clone the original URL.
		const url = new URL(request.url);

		// Define a "pathname" and "search" variables, extracting their values from the cloned URL.
		const { pathname, search } = url;

		// Define the destination URL using the variables you declared previously.
		const destinationURL = `${base}${pathname}${search}`;
		console.log(destinationURL);
