```js
export default {
	async fetch(request) {
		// Get the current timestamp
		const timestamp = Date.now();

		// Convert the timestamp to hexadecimal format
		const hexTimestamp = timestamp.toString(16);

		// Clone the request and add the custom header
		const modifiedRequest = new Request(request, {
			headers: new Headers(request.headers),
		});
		modifiedRequest.headers.set("X-Hex-Timestamp", hexTimestamp);

		// Log the custom header for debugging
		console.log(`X-Hex-Timestamp: ${hexTimestamp}`);

		// Pass the modified request to the origin
		const response = await fetch(modifiedRequest);

		return response;
	},
