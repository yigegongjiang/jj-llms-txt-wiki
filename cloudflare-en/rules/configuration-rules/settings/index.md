You can change the configuration settings described below in a configuration rule.

## Automatic HTTPS Rewrites

[Automatic HTTPS Rewrites](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/edge-certificates/additional-options/automatic-https-rewrites/) prevents end users from seeing `Mixed content` errors by rewriting URLs from `http` to `https` for resources or links on your website that can be served with HTTPS.

```json
"action_parameters": {

## Request Body Buffering

Use the Request Body Buffering setting to configure the request body buffering mode for matching requests:

* **Standard** (default): Allows Cloudflare products to inspect a prefix of the request body when necessary for enabled functionality on your zone.
* **Full**: Buffers the entire request body before sending the request to your origin server.
* **None**: Strictly no buffering. The request body is streamed directly to the origin server without inspection.

Caution

Setting request body buffering to **None** may break functionality that requires body inspection. In particular, this can impact the effectiveness of the Web Application Firewall (WAF) and other security features that rely on analyzing request bodies to detect and block threats.

API information

API configuration property name: `"request_body_buffering"` (string).

API values: `"standard"`, `"full"`, `"none"`.

```json
"action_parameters": {
  "request_body_buffering": "full"
}
```

## Response Body Buffering

Use the Response Body Buffering setting to configure the response body buffering mode for matching requests:

* **Standard** (default): Allows Cloudflare products to inspect a prefix of the response body when necessary for enabled functionality on your zone.
* **None**: Strictly no buffering. The response body is streamed directly to the client without inspection.

Caution

Setting response body buffering to **None** may break functionality that requires body inspection. In particular, this can impact the effectiveness of the Web Application Firewall (WAF) and other security features that rely on analyzing response bodies to detect and block threats.

API information

API configuration property name: `"response_body_buffering"` (string).

API values: `"standard"`, `"none"`.

```json
"action_parameters": {

[SSL/TLS encryption modes](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/origin-configuration/ssl-modes/) control the scheme (`http://` or `https://`) that Cloudflare uses to connect to your origin web server and how SSL certificates presented by your origin will be validated.

Use this setting to configure the SSL/TLS encryption mode for matching requests:
