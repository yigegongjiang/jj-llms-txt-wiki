# Define a single configuration rule using Terraform

Create a configuration rule using Terraform to turn off Email Obfuscation and Browser Integrity Check for API requests in a given zone.

Note

Terraform code snippets below refer to the v4 SDK only.

The following example defines a single configuration rule for a zone using Terraform. The rule disables Email Obfuscation and Browser Integrity Check for API requests.

```tf
# Disable a couple of Cloudflare settings for API requests
resource "cloudflare_ruleset" "http_config_rules_example" {
  zone_id     = "<ZONE_ID>"
  name        = "Config rules ruleset"
  description = "Set configuration rules for incoming requests"
  kind        = "zone"
  phase       = "http_config_settings"

  rules {
    ref         = "disable_obfuscation_bic"
    description = "Disable email obfuscation and BIC for API requests"
    expression  = "(http.request.uri.path matches \"^/api/\")"
    action      = "set_config"
    action_parameters {
      email_obfuscation = false
      bic               = false
    }
  }
}
```

Use the `ref` field to get stable rule IDs across updates when using Terraform. Adding this field prevents Terraform from recreating the rule on changes. For more information, refer to [Troubleshooting](https://developers.cloudflare.com/terraform/troubleshooting/rule-id-changes/#how-to-keep-the-same-rule-id-between-modifications) in the Terraform documentation.
