# Cloudflare Trace limitations

Last updated Apr 16, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/trace-request/limitations/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

## Automatic rule bypasses

Trace does not display rules that are automatically bypassed for operational reasons.

For example, when SSL/TLS certificates are in `pending_validation` status, security rules are automatically disabled for domain control validation (DCV) paths like `/.well-known/pki-validation/` and `/.well-known/acme-challenge/`. These bypasses will not appear in trace results.

For more information, refer to [Why are some rules bypassed?](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/troubleshooting/faq/#why-are-some-rules-bypassed-when-i-did-not-create-an-exception) in the WAF documentation.
