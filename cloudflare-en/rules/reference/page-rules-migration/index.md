# Page Rules migration guide

Last updated Apr 16, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/reference/page-rules-migration/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Cloudflare is continuously improving its platform to deliver more powerful and scalable tools for managing your configurations. To help you take full advantage of these improvements, we recommend using [modern Rules features](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/) for new implementations. These products address the limitations of Page Rules while providing greater flexibility, scalability, and ease of use.

For a quick start, explore the one-click templates available in the Cloudflare dashboard in **Rules** \> **Overview**. These templates simplify common configurations like redirects, rewrites and header modifications, making setup faster and easier.

## Page Rules migration

To make the transition seamless, Cloudflare will handle the migration of your existing Page Rules automatically. This process is planned for late 2025 or beyond, with no action required on your part. You will receive advance notification before any changes are made.

If you wish to explore the benefits of modern Rules features sooner, you can begin adopting them today. Doing so allows you to:

* Take advantage of modern features and capabilities sooner.
* Customize and refine your rules to match your evolving needs.

To assist with this process, we provide you with a comprehensive mapping between Page Rules settings and modern Rules products in this guide.

## Why transition?

Cloudflare Page Rules has several fundamental limitations, such as triggering solely based on URL patterns and being limited to 125 rules per zone for performance reasons. These rules are also complex to debug when multiple page rules apply to the same incoming request.

In 2022, we announced in our blog post [The future of Page Rules ↗](https://blog.cloudflare.com/future-of-page-rules) that Page Rules would be replaced with a suite of dedicated products, each built to be best-of-breed and put more power into the hands of our users. The new Rules products — [Configuration Rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/configuration-rules/), [Compression Rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/compression-rules/), [Origin Rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/origin-rules/), [Redirects](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/url-forwarding/), and [Transform Rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/transform/) — are now generally available (GA) and have already been adopted by tens of thousands of Cloudflare customers.

Improvements in modern Rules features include:

* **New engine**: New Rules features are powered by the [Ruleset Engine](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/), which offers versatile configuration with a robust language that supports many HTTP request and response fields.
* **Improved scalability**: Thanks to the improved scalability, Cloudflare plans now have increased quotas.
* **Easier troubleshooting**: Rule execution is more predictable, since each rule operates independently, simplifying troubleshooting. Additionally, [Cloudflare Trace](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/trace-request/) helps understand rule interactions.
* **Improved consistency**: New Rules features also ensure consistency, with common fields and capabilities shared across products, offering a seamless experience and predictable Terraform configurations.

## Key differences

The evaluation and execution order of Rules features is different from Page Rules:

* **Rule matching logic**: Page Rules apply the first matching rule (first match wins). In contrast, modern Rules are stackable, meaning multiple matching rules can combine and apply to the same request (last match wins). For example, if multiple cache rules match the same URL, the features in those rules will all apply in order.
* **Action separation**: A Page Rule may include multiple actions for different products that are applied in a sequence selected by the customer within the Page Rule itself. Modern Rules features are evaluated [in a fixed sequence](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/origin-rules/#execution-order), with customers defining the rule order within a product [phase](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/reference/phases-list/).
* **Precedence**: Modern Rules features take precedence over Page Rules. For instance, if both define caching settings for the same path, Cache Rules will override Page Rules.
* **Caching behavior**: In Cache Rules, selecting **Eligible for cache** automatically enables **Cache Everything** by default. To maintain the exact behavior of Page Rules, you may need to [adjust your configuration](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cache/how-to/cache-rules/page-rules-migration/).
* **Interactions with Workers**: Requests handled by Workers will suppress Page Rules actions, but they will not suppress actions from modern Rules features.

## Convert Page Rules URLs to filter expressions

Modern Rules use filter expressions instead of URL patterns. These expressions, built with the Rules language, allow greater precision by leveraging [fields](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/rules-language/fields/), [functions](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/rules-language/functions/), and [operators](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/rules-language/operators/).

The following example demonstrates the use of the [http.request.full\_uri](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/rules-language/fields/reference/http.request.full%5Furi/) field and the `wildcard` operator for [wildcard matching](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/rules-language/operators/#wildcard-matching):

A **Page Rules URL** like:

`example.com/*/downloads/*.txt`

becomes a **filter expression** such as:

`http.request.full_uri wildcard "http*://example.com/*/downloads/*.txt*"`

[Single Redirects](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/url-forwarding/single-redirects/create-dashboard/) and [URL Rewrite Rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/transform/url-rewrite/create-dashboard/) also offer a simplified view called **Wildcard pattern**, allowing you to specify URL patterns (`http*://example.com/*/downloads/*.txt*`) without specifying the full filter expression (`http.request.full_uri wildcard "http*://example.com/*/downloads/*.txt*"`).

### Important considerations

* **Protocol scheme**: Page Rules URL matching does not include the URI scheme (for example, `http://` or `https://`) unless explicitly included in the rule. Filter expressions using `http.request.full_uri` field, however, require matching the full URI, including the protocol scheme. To make your filter expression scheme-agnostic, use `http*://` as a wildcard for both `http://` and `https://`.
* **Query strings**: Page Rules ignore query strings unless they are part of the rule URL. Filter expressions include the query string automatically, as part of the `http.request.full_uri` field. To ensure query strings do not affect your matching, append a `*` wildcard at the end of your filter expression, such as `.txt*`.

## Feature correspondence table

To help you map existing Page Rules to modern Rules products, this table outlines how Page Rules settings translate to modern Rules and provides examples for common configurations.

Also, to streamline common configurations, the Cloudflare dashboard now includes dozens of one-click templates, available in **Rules** \> **Overview**. These templates enable you to deploy commonly used features — such as redirects, rewrites, and header modifications — instantly, with pre-filled filter expressions and actions. Explore these templates in the dashboard for a faster setup.

### Migrate Always Use HTTPS

**Context:**

You configured a Page Rule to perform an automatic redirect from HTTP to HTTPS for all subdomains of `example.com` and the `example.com` domain itself:

* **URL** `*example.com/*`
* **Setting**: _Always Use HTTPS_

**How to migrate**:

1. [Create a single redirect](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/url-forwarding/single-redirects/create-dashboard/) to always redirect HTTP requests to HTTPS. You can select the **Redirect from HTTP to HTTPS** rule template or enter the following rule configuration:

  * **If incoming requests match**: Wildcard pattern  
    * **Request URL**: `http://*`
  * **Then**:  
    * **Target URL**: `https://${1}`
    * **Status code**: _301_
    * **Preserve query string**: Enabled
2. Turn off your existing Page Rule and validate the behavior of the redirect you created.
3. If your tests succeed, delete the existing Page Rule.

### Migrate Automatic HTTPS Rewrites

**Context:**

You configured a Page Rule turning on Automatic HTTPS Rewrites for all subdomains of `example.com` and the `example.com` domain itself:

* **URL**: `*example.com/*`
* **Setting**: _Automatic HTTPS Rewrites_
* **Value**: On

**How to migrate**:

1. [Create a configuration rule](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/configuration-rules/create-dashboard/) to always rewrite HTTP links to HTTPS for any hostname containing `example.com`:

  * **When incoming requests match**: Custom filter expression  
    * Using the Expression Builder:  
      `Hostname contains "example.com"`
    * Using the Expression Editor:  
      `(http.host contains "example.com")`
  * **Then the settings are**:  
    * **Setting**: Automatic HTTPS Rewrites
    * **Value**: On
2. Turn off your existing Page Rule and validate the behavior of the configuration rule you created.
3. If your tests succeed, delete the existing Page Rule.

### Migrate Browser Cache TTL

**Context:**

You configured a Page Rule adjusting browser cache TTL to one day for all subdomains of `example.com` and the `example.com` domain itself:

* **URL**: `*example.com/*`
* **Setting**: _Browser Cache TTL_
* **Enter Browser Cache TTL**: _a day_

**How to migrate**:

1. [Create a cache rule](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cache/how-to/cache-rules/create-dashboard/) to adjust browser cache TTL for caching resources in the browser to one day for any hostname containing `example.com`:

  * **When incoming requests match**: Custom filter expression  
    * Using the Expression Builder:  
      `Hostname contains "example.com"`
    * Using the Expression Editor:  
      `(http.host contains "example.com")`
  * **Then**:  
    * **Cache eligibility**: Eligible for cache
    * **Browser TTL**: Override origin and use this TTL
    * **Input time-to-live (TTL)**: _1 day_  
Caution  
The default behavior of Cache Rules is different from Page Rules. Refer to [Key differences](#key-differences) for more information.
2. Turn off your existing Page Rule and validate the behavior of the cache rule you created.
3. If your tests succeed, delete the existing Page Rule.

### Migrate Bypass Cache on Cookie

**Context:**

You configured a Page Rule turning on Bypass Cache on Cookie for all subdomains of `example.com` and the `example.com` domain itself:

* **URL**: `*example.com/*`
* **Setting**: _Bypass Cache on Cookie_
* **Enter value**: `test_cookie`

**How to migrate**:

1. [Create a cache rule](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cache/how-to/cache-rules/create-dashboard/) to bypass cache for requests containing cookie `test_cookie` for any hostname containing `example.com`:

You configured a Page Rule with **Disable Security** (deprecated) for all subdomains of `example.com` and the `example.com` domain itself:

* **URL**: `*example.com/*`
* **Setting**: _Disable Security_

This setting turned off a subset of Cloudflare security features: Email Obfuscation, Rate Limiting (previous version), Scrape Shield, URL (Zone) Lockdown, and WAF managed rules (previous version).

**How to replace**:

1. [Create a configuration rule](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/configuration-rules/create-dashboard/) to turn off one or more security features:

  * [Email Obfuscation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/tools/scrape-shield/email-address-obfuscation/)
  * [Hotlink Protection](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/tools/scrape-shield/hotlink-protection/)
2. If required, [create a WAF exception](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/managed-rules/waf-exceptions/define-dashboard/) to skip one or more rules of WAF managed rulesets for requests coming from IP addresses in an allowlist.
3. Turn off your existing Page Rule and validate the behavior of the rules you created.
4. If your tests succeed, delete the existing Page Rule.

Caution

If you are still using [WAF managed rules (previous version)](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/reference/legacy/old-waf-managed-rules/) or [Rate Limiting (previous version)](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/reference/legacy/old-rate-limiting/), consider upgrading to the new versions of these products. It is not possible to turn off these older products using modern Rules features.

### Migrate Disable Zaraz

**Context:**

You configured a Page Rule turning off [Zaraz](https://developers.cloudflare.com/zaraz/) for all subdomains of `example.com` and the `example.com` domain itself:

* **URL**: `*example.com/*`
* **Setting**: _Disable Zaraz_

**How to migrate**:

1. [Create a configuration rule](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/configuration-rules/create-dashboard/) to turn off Zaraz for any hostname containing `example.com`:

  * **When incoming requests match**: Custom filter expression  
    * Using the Expression Builder:  
      `Hostname contains "example.com"`
    * Using the Expression Editor:  
      `(http.host contains "example.com")`
  * **Then the settings are**:  
    * **Setting**: Disable Zaraz
2. Turn off your existing Page Rule and validate the behavior of the configuration rule you created.
3. If your tests succeed, delete the existing Page Rule.

### Migrate Edge Cache TTL

**Context:**

You configured a Page Rule adjusting Edge Cache TTL for all subdomains of `example.com` and the `example.com` domain itself:

* **URL**: `*example.com/*`
* **Setting**: _Edge Cache TTL_
* **Enter Edge Cache TTL**: _a day_

**How to migrate**:

1. [Create a cache rule](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cache/how-to/cache-rules/create-dashboard/) to adjust edge cache TTL for caching resources on Cloudflare edge to one day, for any hostname containing `example.com`:

  * **When incoming requests match**: Custom filter expression  
    * Using the Expression Builder:  
      `Hostname contains "example.com"`
    * Using the Expression Editor:  
      `(http.host contains "example.com")`
  * **Then**:  
    * **Cache eligibility**: Eligible for cache
    * **Setting**: Edge TTL  
      * Ignore cache-control header and use this TTL
      * **Input time-to-live (TTL)**: _1 day_  
Caution  
The default behavior of Cache Rules is different from Page Rules. Refer to [Key differences](#key-differences) for more information.
2. Turn off your existing Page Rule and validate the behavior of the cache rule you created.
3. If your tests succeed, delete the existing Page Rule.

### Migrate Forwarding URL

**Example #1: Redirect `www` to root domain**

**Context:**

You configured a Page Rule permanently redirecting `www.example.com` to `example.com` on all URI paths:

* **URL**: `www.example.com/*`
* **Setting**: _Forwarding URL_
* **Select Status code**: _301 - Permanent Redirect_
* **Destination URL**: `https://example.com/$1`

**How to migrate**:

1. [Create a single redirect](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/url-forwarding/single-redirects/create-dashboard/) to permanently redirect requests from `https://www.example.com` to `https://example.com`. You can select the **Redirect from WWW to Root** rule template or enter the following rule configuration:

  * **If incoming requests match**: Wildcard pattern  
    * **Request URL**: `https://www.example.com/*`
  * **Then**:  
    * **Target URL**: `https://example.com/${1}`
    * **Status code**: _301_
    * **Preserve query string**: Enabled
2. Turn off your existing Page Rule and validate the behavior of the redirect you created.
3. If your tests succeed, delete the existing Page Rule.

Notes about the rule equivalence

The provided example using Single Redirects is not an exact match for the previously existing Page Rule in the same example.

The exact equivalent would need to match both HTTP and HTTPS incoming requests, which you could achieve using a wildcard pattern like the following (notice the extra `*` after `http`):

* **Request URL**: `http*://www.example.com/*`

This would require you to also change the **Target URL** to use the second wildcard capture group instead of the first one (corresponding to the text captured by second `*` in the wildcard pattern above):

* **Target URL**: `https://example.com/${2}`

**Example #2: Redirect all pages under old path to new path**

**Context:**

You configured a Page Rule permanently redirecting `example.com/old-path` to `example.com/new-path`:

* **URL**: `example.com/old-path/*`
* **Setting**: _Forwarding URL_
* **Select Status code**: _301 - Permanent Redirect_
* **Destination URL**: `https://example.com/new-path/$1`

**How to migrate**:

1. [Create a single redirect](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/url-forwarding/single-redirects/create-dashboard/) to permanently redirect requests for `example.com/old-path` to `example.com/new-path`:

  * **If incoming requests match**: Wildcard pattern  
    * **Request URL**: `https://example.com/old-path/*`
  * **Then**:  
    * **Target URL**: `https://example.com/new-path/${1}`
    * **Status code**: _301_
    * **Preserve query string**: Enabled
2. Turn off your existing Page Rule and validate the behavior of the redirect you created.

### Migrate Host Header Override

**Context:**

You configured a Page Rule changing the `Host` HTTP header to `example.saas-provider.com`, for all requests addressed at any subdomain of `example.com` and the `example.com` domain itself:

* **URL**: `*example.com/*`
* **Setting**: _Host Header Override_
* **Enter value**: `example.saas-provider.com`

**How to migrate**:

1. [Create an origin rule](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/origin-rules/create-dashboard/) changing the `Host` header to `example.saas-provider.com` for any hostname containing `example.com`:

  * **When incoming requests match**: Custom filter expression  
    * Using the Expression Builder:  
      `Hostname contains "example.com"`
    * Using the Expression Editor:  
      `(http.host contains "example.com")`
  * **Then**:  
    * **Set origin parameters**:  
      * **Host Header** \> **Rewrite to**: `example.saas-provider.com`
2. Turn off your existing Page Rule and validate the behavior of the origin rule you created.
3. If your tests succeed, delete the existing Page Rule.
