**CASB adds support for Claude Compliance API**  

[Cloudflare CASB](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/integrations/cloud-and-saas/anthropic/) now integrates with the [Claude Compliance API ↗](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/13015708-access-the-compliance-api). This enhancement gives security teams visibility into Claude usage patterns, admin activity, and compliance-relevant events across their organization.

The Claude Compliance API provides structured access to audit logs and administrative actions within Claude Enterprise and Claude Platform. Cloudflare CASB ingests this data to surface security findings that help organizations enhance their security posture and enforce AI governance.

#### Key capabilities

Starting today, security teams can scan for security findings across the following assets:

* **Public projects** — Projects set to public visibility
* **Project attachment** — Files and documents added to projects that violate DLP policies
* **Chat files** — User-uploaded and provider-generated files that violate DLP policies
* **Chat messages** — User prompts and provider responses that violate DLP policies
* **Artifacts** — Provider-generated documents and files that violate DLP policies

#### Learn more

This [integration](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/integrations/cloud-and-saas/anthropic/) is available to all Cloudflare One customers. New Cloudflare customers can sign up and start with their first two integrations for free. Existing customers can enable the integration directly in the dashboard. The integration begins scanning immediately and surfaces findings in the dashboard within minutes.

**Send CASB posture finding instances with webhooks**  

You can now use **CASB webhooks** in Cloudflare One to send posture finding instances to external systems such as chat platforms, ticketing systems, SIEMs, SOAR tools, and custom automation services.

This gives security teams a simple way to route CASB posture findings into the tools and workflows they already use for triage and response.

To get started, go to **Integrations** \> **Webhooks** in the Cloudflare One dashboard to create a webhook destination. After you configure a webhook, open a posture finding instance and select **Send webhook** to send it.

#### Key capabilities

* **Flexible authentication** — Configure destinations using **None**, **Basic Auth**, **Bearer Auth**, **Static Headers**, or **HMAC-Signing**.
* **Built-in testing** — Use **Test delivery** to send a test request before sending a live finding instance.
* **Posture finding workflows** — Send posture finding instances directly from the finding details workflow in **Cloud & SaaS findings**.
* **HTTPS destinations** — Configure webhook destinations with public `https://` URLs.

#### Learn more

* Configure [CASB webhooks](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/integrations/cloud-and-saas/webhooks/) in Cloudflare.
* Learn how to [manage findings](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/cloud-and-saas-findings/manage-findings/) in Cloudflare.

CASB webhooks are now available in Cloudflare One.

**Understand CASB findings instantly with Cloudy Summaries**  

You can now easily understand your SaaS security posture findings and why they were detected with **Cloudy Summaries in CASB**. This feature integrates Cloudflare's Cloudy AI directly into your CASB Posture Findings to automatically generate clear, plain-language summaries of complex security misconfigurations, third-party app risks, and data exposures.

This allows security teams and IT administrators to drastically reduce triage time by immediately understanding the context, potential impact, and necessary remediation steps for any given finding—without needing to be an expert in every connected SaaS application.

To view a summary, simply navigate to your Posture Findings in the Cloudflare One dashboard (under **Cloud and SaaS findings**) and open the finding details of a specific instance of a Finding.

Cloudy Summaries are supported on all available integrations, including Microsoft 365, Google Workspace, Salesforce, GitHub, AWS, Slack, and Dropbox. See the full list of supported integrations [here](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/integrations/cloud-and-saas/).

#### Key capabilities

* **Contextual explanations** — Quickly understand the specifics of a finding with plain-language summaries detailing exactly what was detected, from publicly shared sensitive files to risky third-party app scopes.
* **Clear risk assessment** — Instantly grasp the potential security impact of the finding, such as data breach risks, unauthorized account access, or email spoofing vulnerabilities.
* **Actionable guidance** — Get clear recommendations and next steps on how to effectively remediate the issue and secure your environment.
* **Built-in feedback** — Help improve future AI summarization accuracy by submitting feedback directly using the thumbs-up and thumbs-down buttons.

**New SaaS Security weekly digests with API CASB**  

You can now stay on top of your SaaS security posture with the new **CASB Weekly Digest** notification. This opt-in email digest is delivered to your inbox every Monday morning and provides a high-level summary of your organization's Cloudflare API CASB findings from the previous week.

This allows security teams and IT administrators to get proactive, at-a-glance visibility into new risks and integration health without having to log in to the dashboard.

To opt in, navigate to **Manage Account** \> **Notifications** in the Cloudflare dashboard to configure the **CASB Weekly Digest** alert type.

#### Key capabilities

**CASB introduces new granular roles**  

Cloudflare CASB (Cloud Access Security Broker) now supports two new granular roles to provide more precise access control for your security teams:

* **Cloudflare CASB Read:** Provides read-only access to view CASB findings and dashboards. This role is ideal for security analysts, compliance auditors, or team members who need visibility without modification rights.
* **Cloudflare CASB:** Provides full administrative access to configure and manage all aspects of the CASB product.

These new roles help you better enforce the principle of least privilege. You can now grant specific members access to CASB security findings without assigning them broader permissions, such as the **Super Administrator** or **Administrator** roles.

To enable [Data Loss Prevention (DLP)](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/data-loss-prevention/dlp-profiles/), scans in CASB, account members will need the **Cloudflare Zero Trust** role.

You can find these new roles when inviting members or creating API tokens in the Cloudflare dashboard under **Manage Account** \> **Members**.

To learn more about managing roles and permissions, refer to the [Manage account members and roles documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/manage-members/roles/).
