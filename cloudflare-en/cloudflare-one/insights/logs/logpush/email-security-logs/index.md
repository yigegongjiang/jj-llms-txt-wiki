# Email security logs

Last updated Apr 29, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/insights/logs/logpush/email-security-logs/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Email security allows you to configure Logpush to export two types of log data: detection logs (records of threats identified in email traffic) and user action logs (records of administrative actions taken via the API or the dashboard). Each log type requires separate configuration.

## Enable detection logs

Detection logs record each threat identified by Email security, including metadata such as the message sender, recipient, and detection verdict.

To enable detection logs, refer to [Enable destinations](https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/logpush/logpush-job/enable-destinations/). When configuring the Logpush job, select **Email security alerts** as the dataset.

## Enable user action logs

User action logs record all administrative actions taken via the [API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/email%5Fsecurity/) or the dashboard.

Before you can enable user action logs for Email security, you must have a Logpush job configured for your storage destination. Refer to [Enable destinations](https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/logpush/logpush-job/enable-destinations/) to enable logs on destinations such as Cloudflare R2, HTTP, Amazon S3, and more.

Once you have configured your destination, you can set up user action logs:

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Logpush** page.  
[Go to **Logpush** ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/logs)
2. Select your storage destination.
3. Select the three dots > **Edit**.
4. Under **Configure logpush job**:
* **Job name**: Enter the job name, if it is not already prepopulated.
* **If logs match** \> Select **Filtered logs** to capture only Email security events:  
  * **Field**: Choose `ResourceType` (the type of resource that was changed).
  * **Operator**: Choose `starts with`.
  * **Value**: Enter `email_security`.
1. Select **Submit**.

You can now view logs via the Cloudflare dashboard.
