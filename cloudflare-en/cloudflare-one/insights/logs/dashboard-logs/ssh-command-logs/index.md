# SSH command logs

Last updated May 1, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/insights/logs/dashboard-logs/ssh-command-logs/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

SSH command logs record the commands that users run on infrastructure targets protected by [Access for Infrastructure](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-tunnel/use-cases/ssh/ssh-infrastructure-access/). Use these logs to audit user activity on your SSH servers and investigate specific sessions.

To view SSH command logs, log in to [Cloudflare One ↗](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/) and go to **Insights** \> **Logs** \> **SSH command logs**.

## Prerequisites

To generate SSH command logs, you must:

1. Set up [Access for Infrastructure](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-tunnel/use-cases/ssh/ssh-infrastructure-access/) for your SSH servers.
2. [Enable SSH command logging](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-tunnel/use-cases/ssh/ssh-infrastructure-access/#ssh-command-logs) by uploading an encryption public key. Cloudflare uses this key to encrypt your logs so that only you can read their contents.

## View SSH logs

SSH command logs displayed in the dashboard are encrypted using the public key you provided during setup. The logs are not readable in the dashboard — you must download and decrypt them locally. To view the contents of the logs:

1. In [Cloudflare One ↗](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/), go to **Insights** \> **Logs** \> **SSH command logs**.
2. Filter the logs using the name of your SSH application.
3. Select the SSH session for which you want to export command logs.
4. In the side panel, scroll down to **SSH logs** and select **Download**.
5. Decrypt the log using the [SSH Logging CLI ↗](https://github.com/cloudflare/ssh-log-cli/) and the private key that corresponds to the public key you uploaded.

## Export SSH logs with Logpush

Enterprise users can export SSH command logs to external storage or analysis destinations using [Logpush](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/insights/logs/logpush/). Unlike dashboard logs, Logpush payloads are not encrypted with a customer-provided public key — secure access to your storage destination accordingly.

For a list of all available fields, refer to [SSH Logs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/logpush/logpush-job/datasets/account/ssh%5Flogs/).
