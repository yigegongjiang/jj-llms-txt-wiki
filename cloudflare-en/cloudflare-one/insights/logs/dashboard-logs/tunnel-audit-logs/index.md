# Tunnel audit logs

Last updated May 1, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/insights/logs/dashboard-logs/tunnel-audit-logs/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

[Cloudflare Tunnel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-tunnel/) creates outbound-only connections between your infrastructure and Cloudflare. Tunnel audit logs record when these connections start, stop, or register new DNS records.

Audit logs for Tunnel are available in the [account section of the Cloudflare dashboard ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?account=audit-log), which you can find by selecting your name or email in the upper right-hand corner of the dashboard. For general audit log features such as filtering and retention, refer to [Audit Logs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/account/account-security/audit-logs/). The following actions are logged:

| Action       | Description                                                                                                |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Registered   | A tunnel connector (cloudflared) started and connected to Cloudflare's global network.                     |
| Unregistered | A tunnel connector disconnected from Cloudflare's global network.                                          |
| CNAME add    | A tunnel registered a new DNS record (CNAME or AAAA) to route traffic to an application behind the tunnel. |
