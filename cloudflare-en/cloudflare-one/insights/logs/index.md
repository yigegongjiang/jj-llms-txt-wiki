## Log retention

Cloudflare stores Zero Trust logs for different periods of time based on the service and plan type:

|                         | Free      | Standard  | Access    | Gateway   | Enterprise                      |

## Log Explorer Beta

Log Explorer users can store Zero Trust logs directly within Cloudflare in an [R2 bucket](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/) and access them with the dashboard or API. Log Explorer supports the following Zero Trust datasets:

* [Access requests](https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/logpush/logpush-job/datasets/account/access%5Frequests/) (`FROM access_requests`)
* [CASB Findings](https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/logpush/logpush-job/datasets/account/casb%5Ffindings/) (`FROM casb_findings`)
* [Device posture results](https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/logpush/logpush-job/datasets/account/device%5Fposture%5Fresults/) (`FROM device_posture_results`)
* [Gateway DNS](https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/logpush/logpush-job/datasets/account/gateway%5Fdns/) (`FROM gateway_dns`)
* [Gateway HTTP](https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/logpush/logpush-job/datasets/account/gateway%5Fhttp/) (`FROM gateway_http`)
* [Gateway Network](https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/logpush/logpush-job/datasets/account/gateway%5Fnetwork/) (`FROM gateway_network`)
* [Zero Trust Network Session Logs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/logpush/logpush-job/datasets/account/zero%5Ftrust%5Fnetwork%5Fsessions/) (`FROM zero_trust_network_sessions`)

For more information, refer to [Log Explorer](https://developers.cloudflare.com/log-explorer/).

## Customer Metadata Boundary

You can use Cloudflare Zero Trust with the Data Localization Suite to restrict data storage to a specific geographic region. For more information, refer to [Customer Metadata Boundary](https://developers.cloudflare.com/data-localization/metadata-boundary/).

## Data privacy

For more information on how we use this data, refer to our [Privacy Policy ↗](https://www.cloudflare.com/application/privacypolicy/).

## Footnotes

1. Enterprise users on per query plans cannot store DNS logs via Cloudflare. You can still export logs via [Logpush](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/insights/logs/logpush/). For more information, contact your account team. [↩](#user-content-fnref-1)
