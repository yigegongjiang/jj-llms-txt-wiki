# Network session analytics

Last updated Apr 24, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/insights/analytics/network-sessions/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

The Network session analytics dashboard provides visibility into your Cloudflare One traffic patterns. This dashboard helps you understand how traffic flows through your network, including on-ramps (how traffic enters Cloudflare, such as the [Cloudflare One Client](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/cloudflare-one-client/), [proxy endpoints (PAC files)](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/resolvers-and-proxies/proxy-endpoints/), [Browser Isolation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/remote-browser-isolation/), or Cloudflare Tunnel) and off-ramps (how traffic exits Cloudflare, such as the public Internet or a [Cloudflare Tunnel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-tunnel/)).

The dashboard is based on the [Zero Trust network sessions Logpush dataset](https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/logpush/logpush-job/datasets/account/zero%5Ftrust%5Fnetwork%5Fsessions/). For definitions on any field, refer to the dataset schema documentation.

To review Network session analytics:

1. In the [Cloudflare dashboard ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/), go to **Zero Trust** \> **Insights** \> **Dashboards**.
2. Select **Network session analytics**.

Refer to [Insights overview](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/insights/) to learn how to use Analytics dashboards together with [Analytics Overview](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/insights/analytics-overview/) and [Digital Experience Monitoring (DEX)](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/insights/dex/) for complete visibility and troubleshooting.

## Use cases

The Network session analytics dashboard helps you:

* **Understand traffic patterns**: Visualize how traffic flows through your network infrastructure.
* **Monitor bandwidth usage**: Track upload, download, and total bytes transferred across your network.
* **Identify connection issues**: Analyze connection close reasons to troubleshoot network problems.
* **Track user and device activity**: Monitor unique users and devices accessing your network.

## Provided analytics

### Summary metrics

* **Session count**: Total number of network sessions. Each session represents an individual TCP, UDP, ICMP, or ICMPv6 flow that passes through Gateway.
* **Bytes total**: Total bytes transferred (upload + download)
* **Unique users**: Number of distinct users

### Traffic by location

* **World map**: Geographic visualization of network traffic by the Cloudflare data center where traffic entered the network (ingress) and where it exited (egress)
* **Location list**: Top Cloudflare data center locations by ingress and egress session count with accompanying graph
* **Change**: Shows the total change across ingress and egress for each location

### Top analytics

* **Top protocols**: Most used network protocols (TCP, UDP, ICMP, ICMPv6)
* **Top connection close reasons**: Common reasons for session termination:  
  * Client closed
  * Origin closed
  * Client idle timeout
  * Client error
  * Unknown
  * Client TLS error
  * Origin unreachable
  * Too many new sessions for user
  * Origin TLS error
  * Origin unroutable

For the full list of reasons for session termination, refer to [ConnectionCloseReason](https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/logpush/logpush-job/datasets/account/zero%5Ftrust%5Fnetwork%5Fsessions/#connectionclosereason).
