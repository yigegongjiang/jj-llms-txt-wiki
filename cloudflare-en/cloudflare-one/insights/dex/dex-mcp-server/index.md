# DEX MCP server

Last updated Apr 17, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/insights/dex/dex-mcp-server/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

The MCP server [(Model Context Protocol) ↗](https://cloudflare.com/learning/ai/what-is-model-context-protocol-mcp/) for Digital Experience Monitoring (DEX) is an AI tool that allows customers to ask a question like, "Show me the connectivity and performance metrics for the device used by carly‌@acme.com", and receive an answer that contains data from the DEX API.

Any Cloudflare One customer using a Free, Pay-as-you-go, or Enterprise account can access the DEX MCP server.

There are two primary options for connecting to the DEX MCP server:

* [In Cloudflare's AI Playground](#cloudflare-ai-playground)
* [With your preferred AI assistant](#ai-assistant)

## Cloudflare AI Playground

Cloudflare's AI Playground allows you to quickly try out the DEX MCP server.

You can test the DEX MCP server in less than one minute by visiting the AI Playground's website.

1. Copy the URL for the DEX MCP server: `https://dex.mcp.cloudflare.com/mcp`.
2. Open [playground.ai.cloudflare.com ↗](https://playground.ai.cloudflare.com) in a browser.
3. Find the section in the left sidebar titled **MCP Servers**.
4. Paste the URL for the DEX MCP server into the URL input box and select **Connect**.
5. Authenticate your Cloudflare account, and then start asking questions about your DEX data.

Note

You need to ask specific and explicit questions to get a response. For example, first you need to provide the following instruction: "Set XYZ as the active account". Then, you can ask a specific question: "Fetch the DEX test results for the user bob@‌acme.com over the past 24 hours".

## AI Assistant

You can get a more flexible and robust experience by configuring the DEX MCP server with your preferred AI assistant (for example, Claude, Gemini, or ChatGPT).

If you have any issues during the configuration process, you can ask your AI assistant for help with configuring an MCP server via URL.

### Claude

You need a Claude Pro account (or higher subscription) to configure an MCP server.

1. Download the [Claude desktop client ↗](https://claude.ai/download).
2. Open the Claude desktop client, and log in or set up an account.
3. Expand the left sidebar menu, and select **Claude Code**.
4. Under **Desktop app**, select **Developer** to show the **Local MCP servers** page.
5. Select **Edit Config** and open the `claude_desktop_config.json` file in a text editor of your choice.
6. Copy the JSON configuration for the DEX MCP server and paste it into `claude_desktop_config.json`. Save the file.  
```json  
{  
	"globalShortcut": "",  
	"mcpServers": {  
		"cloudflare-dex-analysis": {  
			"command": "npx",  
			"args": ["mcp-remote", "https://dex.mcp.cloudflare.com/mcp"]  
		}  
	}  
}  
```
7. Fully close Claude by using the task manager to stop any background processes related to Claude.
8. Open Claude, and your DEX MCP server configuration should appear on the **Local MCP servers** page.
9. Authenticate your Cloudflare account and allow the DEX MCP server.
10. You can start asking Claude questions about DEX. As a simple test, you can ask "Are you connected to the DEX MCP server".

### Gemini CLI

All tiers of Google AI Free, Pro, and Ultra offer an MCP server integration via the Gemini CLI.

You will need to use a CLI of your choice and npm or homebrew to install and access the Gemini CLI.

1. Visit the GitHub page for the [Gemini CLI ↗](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli) and follow the installation instructions.
2. Navigate to the `settings.json` file for your Gemini CLI install and open it in a text editor of your choice.  
File path for the `settings.json` file
  * Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\.gemini\settings.json`
  * Mac and Linux: `~/.gemini/settings.json`
3. Copy the JSON configuration for the DEX MCP server and paste it into **settings.json**. Save the file.  
```json  
{  
	"globalShortcut": "",  
	"mcpServers": {  
		"cloudflare-dex-analysis": {  
			"command": "npx",  
			"args": ["mcp-remote", "https://dex.mcp.cloudflare.com/mcp"]  
		}  
	}  
}  
```
4. Run Gemini in your CLI of choice.
5. If everything is working as expected, the Gemini CLI will show the following message:  
`Using: 1 MCP server (ctrl+t to view)`
6. Authenticate the email associated with your Cloudflare account in the Gemini CLI.
7. You can start asking the Gemini CLI questions about DEX. As a simple test, you can ask "Are you connected to the DEX MCP server".

### ChatGPT

You need a ChatGPT Pro or Business account to configure an MCP server. ChatGPT Free and Plus do not support MCP servers.

1. Download the [ChatGPT desktop app ↗](https://chatgpt.com/features/desktop).
2. Open the ChatGPT desktop app, and log in or set up an account.
3. Open the **Settings** menu and select **Connectors**.
4. Select the option to create a new Connector.
5. Provide a **Name** (like `DEX MCP`), **Description** (optional), and **MCP Server URL** for the Connector. The DEX MCP Server URL is: `https://dex.mcp.cloudflare.com/mcp`.
6. Create the new Connector.
7. Before you ask ChatGPT a question about DEX, select the **+** (plus) button next to the ChatGPT prompt box.
8. Select **Use Connectors** \> **Add Sources**, then select the DEX MCP as a source.
9. You can start asking ChatGPT questions about DEX. As a simple test, you can ask "Are you connected to the DEX MCP server".
