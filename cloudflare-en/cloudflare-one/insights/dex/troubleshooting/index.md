# Troubleshoot Digital Experience Monitoring

Last updated May 1, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/insights/dex/troubleshooting/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Review common troubleshooting scenarios for Digital Experience Monitoring (DEX).

## Data visibility

### No data displayed for certain users

If you do not see DEX data for specific users in your organization, verify the following:

* **Client version**: Ensure the users are running a version of the Cloudflare One Client that supports DEX.
* **DEX enabled**: Confirm that DEX is enabled for the [device profile](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/cloudflare-one-client/configure/device-profiles/) assigned to those users.
* **Traffic routing**: DEX requires that traffic to Cloudflare's orchestration API is not blocked by local firewalls or SSL-inspecting proxies.

### Fleet status not updating

The Fleet status dashboard can take several minutes to reflect changes in device connectivity. If a device remains in an incorrect state, try disconnecting and reconnecting the Cloudflare One Client to force a status update.

## Remote captures

### Remote capture fails to start

Remote captures require the Cloudflare One Client to be connected and able to communicate with the Cloudflare control plane. If a capture fails to start:

* Verify the device status in the Zero Trust dashboard.
* Ensure the device has sufficient disk space to store the capture files before upload.
* Check for any local firewall rules that might be blocking the capture command.
