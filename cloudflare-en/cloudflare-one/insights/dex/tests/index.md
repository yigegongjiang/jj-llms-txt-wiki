# Synthetic tests

Last updated Apr 22, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/insights/dex/tests/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

With Digital Experience Monitoring (DEX), you can test if your devices can connect to a private or public endpoint through the Cloudflare One Client. Tests allow you to monitor availability for a given application and investigate performance issues reported by your end users.

DEX tests will only run when the Cloudflare One Client is turned on, whereas [fleet status](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/insights/dex/monitoring/#fleet-status) metrics are always available.

To control which users or groups run a test, use [DEX rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/insights/dex/rules/).

* [HTTP test](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/insights/dex/tests/http/)
* [Traceroute test](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/insights/dex/tests/traceroute/)
* [View test results](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/insights/dex/tests/view-results/)

## Export DEX application test logs

You can use [Logpush](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/insights/logs/logpush/) to export [DEX application test](https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/logpush/logpush-job/datasets/account/dex%5Fapplication%5Ftests/) data to [R2](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/) (Cloudflare's object storage), a third-party cloud storage bucket, or a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tool. This is useful if you need to retain test data beyond the [7-day log retention period](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/insights/logs/#log-retention) or correlate DEX data with other log sources.
