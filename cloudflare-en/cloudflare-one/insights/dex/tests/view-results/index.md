# View test results

Last updated Apr 22, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/insights/dex/tests/view-results/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Use the results of a Digital Experience Monitoring (DEX) test to monitor availability and performance for a specific application. DEX stores test results for 7 days on all plans, according to the [log retention policy](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/insights/logs/#log-retention).

## Prerequisites

* At least one [test](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/insights/dex/tests/) has been created under **DEX** \> **Tests**.
* Admins must have at least the [Cloudflare Zero Trust Reporting role](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/roles-permissions/#zero-trust-roles).

## View results for all devices

To view an overview of test results for all devices:

1. In [Cloudflare One ↗](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/), go to **Insights** \> **Digital experience**.
2. Select the **Tests** tab.
3. Select a test to view detailed results.

## View results for an individual device

To view analytics on a per-device level:

1. In [Cloudflare One ↗](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/), go to **Team & Resources** \> **Devices** \> **Your devices**.
2. Select the device you want to view, and then select **View details**.
3. Select the **Tests** tab.
4. Select a test to view detailed results.

## Export DEX application test logs

You can use [Logpush](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/insights/logs/logpush/) to export [DEX application test](https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/logpush/logpush-job/datasets/account/dex%5Fapplication%5Ftests/) data to [R2](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/) (Cloudflare's object storage), a third-party cloud storage bucket, or a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tool. This is useful if you need to retain test data beyond the [7-day log retention period](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/insights/logs/#log-retention) or correlate DEX data with other log sources.
