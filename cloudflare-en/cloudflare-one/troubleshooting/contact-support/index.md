If you cannot resolve an issue using our troubleshooting guides, you can [open a support case](https://developers.cloudflare.com/support/contacting-cloudflare-support/).

To help us investigate your issue quickly, please collect and provide the following information when you contact Cloudflare Support.

## 1\. Gather general information

For all issues, please include:

* **Timestamp (UTC)**: The exact time the issue occurred.
* **Detailed description**: A clear description of the problem and the steps to reproduce it.
* **Actual vs. Expected**: What happened versus what you expected to happen.
* **Problem frequency**: How often does the issue occur?
* **Screenshots**: Any relevant screenshots or videos of the error.
* **Example URLs**: Specific URLs where the issue is occurring.

## 2\. Collect product diagnostics

Depending on the product, providing diagnostic files is critical for a technical investigation.

### Cloudflare One Client (WARP)

If the issue involves the Cloudflare One Client, run the `warp-diag` command on the affected device and attach the resulting `.zip` file to your case. For more information, refer to [Diagnostic logs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/cloudflare-one-client/troubleshooting/diagnostic-logs/).

### Cloudflare Tunnel

If the issue involves Cloudflare Tunnel, run the `cloudflared tunnel diag` command and provide the generated report. For more information, refer to [Tunnel diagnostic logs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-tunnel/troubleshoot-tunnels/diag-logs/).

### Access and Gateway

For issues related to authentication loops, blocked websites, or policy enforcement:

* **HAR file**: Provide a [HAR file](https://developers.cloudflare.com/support/troubleshooting/general-troubleshooting/gathering-information-for-troubleshooting-sites/#generate-a-har-file) captured while reproducing the issue.
* **Ray ID**: If you see a Cloudflare error page, provide the **Ray ID** displayed at the bottom of the page.
* **Identity Provider logs**: Relevant logs from your identity provider (IdP) if the issue involves login failures.
* **Request ID**: For Gateway issues, you can find the `request_id` (HTTP logs) or `query_id` (DNS logs) in your [Gateway logs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/traffic-policies/troubleshooting/).

### Digital Experience Monitoring (DEX)

For issues with DEX tests or device monitoring, provide a [remote capture](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/insights/dex/diagnostics/client-packet-capture/) from the Zero Trust dashboard.
