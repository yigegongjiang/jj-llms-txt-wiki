# CASB

Last updated Apr 17, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/troubleshooting/casb/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Use this guide to troubleshoot common issues with Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB).

## Security findings

### Findings not appearing

If you do not see findings for an integrated application:

* **Wait for scan**: Initial scans can take up to 24 hours depending on the size of the application.
* **Permissions**: Ensure the account used to integrate the application has the necessary administrative permissions.
* **Enabled status**: Verify that the integration is enabled in the Zero Trust dashboard.

### False positives

If CASB flags a configuration that is intended for your organization:

1. Go to **CASB** \> **Findings**.
2. Select the finding and choose **Dismiss**.
3. Provide a reason for dismissal to help refine future scans.
