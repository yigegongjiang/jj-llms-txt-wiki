# Get started

Last updated Apr 21, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-mesh/get-started/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Set up Cloudflare Mesh so your devices and servers can reach each other by private IP.

## Prerequisites

* A [Cloudflare account ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up)
* A laptop or phone to connect as a client device
* (Optional) A Linux server to deploy a Mesh node  
Linux server requirements

## Footnotes

  1. On RHEL 9 and later, enable the [Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux (EPEL) ↗](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/epel/) repository (`sudo dnf install epel-release`) before installing `cloudflare-warp`. EPEL provides dependencies required by the client UI. [↩](#user-content-fnref-1)
  2. Minimum 1281 bytes with [Path MTU Discovery](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/cloudflare-one-client/deployment/mdm-deployment/path-mtu-discovery/) [↩](#user-content-fnref-2)  
Mesh nodes are optional  
Client-to-client connectivity works without any Mesh nodes. Two enrolled laptops can reach each other directly by Mesh IP. Mesh nodes are for running the client in headless mode on a server — either to make that server reachable by its Mesh IP, or to [route traffic to a private subnet](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-mesh/routes/) behind it. You still need to complete the setup wizard to configure your account — you can skip the Mesh node installation step and connect the node later.

## 1\. Run the setup wizard

The setup wizard [configures your account for Mesh networking](#what-the-wizard-configures) and optionally guides you through creating a Mesh node. This is a one-time setup.

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to **Networking** \> **Mesh**.  
[Go to **Mesh** ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/mesh)
2. Select **Add a node**.
3. Enter a name for your node (for example, `web-server` or `staging-db`).
4. Select **Create node**.
5. (Optional) If you have a Linux server, run the install commands shown in the dashboard to bring the node online. If you do not have a server ready, select **I'll connect later** — you can install the node at any time from the node detail page.  
Installation commands  
```sh  
curl -fsSL https://pkg.cloudflareclient.com/pubkey.gpg | sudo gpg --yes --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/cloudflare-warp-archive-keyring.gpg &&  
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/cloudflare-warp-archive-keyring.gpg] https://pkg.cloudflareclient.com/ $(. /etc/os-release && echo $VERSION_CODENAME) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/cloudflare-client.list &&  
sudo apt-get update -qq && sudo apt-get install -y -qq cloudflare-warp &&  
printf 'net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1\nnet.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding = 1\nnet.ipv6.conf.all.accept_ra = 2\n' | sudo tee /etc/sysctl.d/99-zzz-cloudflare-warp-connector.conf &&  
sudo sysctl --system  
```  
```sh  
sudo warp-cli connector new <TOKEN> && sudo warp-cli connect  
```  
On RHEL 9 and later, enable the Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux (EPEL) repository before installing `cloudflare-warp`. EPEL provides dependencies required by the Cloudflare One Client UI:  
```sh  
sudo dnf install -y epel-release  
```  
Then install the package:  
```sh  
curl -fsSl https://pkg.cloudflareclient.com/cloudflare-warp-ascii.repo | sudo tee /etc/yum.repos.d/cloudflare-warp.repo &&  
sudo yum install -y cloudflare-warp &&  
printf 'net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1\nnet.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding = 1\nnet.ipv6.conf.all.accept_ra = 2\n' | sudo tee /etc/sysctl.d/99-zzz-cloudflare-warp-connector.conf &&  
sudo sysctl --system  
```  
```sh  
sudo warp-cli connector new <TOKEN> && sudo warp-cli connect  
```
6. Select **View node details** to complete the setup wizard.

If you installed the node, it should appear as **Online** on the Mesh overview page along with its assigned **Mesh IP**. If the node does not come online, refer to [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting).

## 2\. Connect a client device

Connect a laptop or phone to your Mesh network:

### Windows, macOS, and Linux

To enroll your device using the client GUI:

1. [Download](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/cloudflare-one-client/download/) and install the Cloudflare One Client.
2. Launch the Cloudflare One Client.
3. On the **What would you like to use the Cloudflare One Client for?** screen, select **Zero Trust security**.
4. Enter your team name.
5. Complete the authentication steps required by your organization.  
Once authenticated, you will see a Success page and a dialog prompting you to open the Cloudflare One Client.
6. Select **Open the Cloudflare One Client** to complete the registration.

1. [Download](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/cloudflare-one-client/download/) and install the Cloudflare One Client.
2. Launch the Cloudflare One Client.
3. Select the Cloudflare logo in the menu bar.
4. Select the gear icon.
5. Go to **Preferences** \> **Account**.
6. Select **Login with Cloudflare Zero Trust**.
7. Enter your team name.
8. Complete the authentication steps required by your organization.  
Once authenticated, you will see a Success page and a dialog prompting you to open the Cloudflare One Client.
9. Select **Open Cloudflare WARP.app** to complete the registration.

### iOS and Android

1. [Download](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/cloudflare-one-client/download/) and install the Cloudflare One Agent app.
2. Launch the Cloudflare One Agent app.
3. Select **Next**.
4. Review the privacy policy and select **Accept**.
5. Enter your team name.
6. Complete the authentication steps required by your organization.
7. After authenticating, select **Install VPN Profile**.
8. In the **Connection request** popup window, select **OK**.
9. If you did not enable [auto-connect ↗](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/cloudflare-one-client/configure/settings/#auto-connect), manually turn on the switch to **Connected**.

Once you see a **Connected** status, your device is on the mesh and receives its own Mesh IP.

## 3\. Test connectivity

From your client device, verify you can reach a Mesh node or another enrolled device:

```sh
ping <MESH-IP>
```

Replace `<MESH-IP>` with the Mesh IP of a node or another device (visible on the Mesh overview page). You can also SSH, connect to a database, or call an API — any TCP, UDP, or ICMP traffic works.

## Logs

Traffic from Mesh nodes appears in [Gateway activity logs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/insights/logs/dashboard-logs/gateway-logs/) with the identity `warp_connector@<your-team-name>.cloudflareaccess.com`. Client device traffic appears in Gateway activity logs under the enrolled user's identity.

## What the wizard configures

When you create your first Mesh node, the setup wizard automatically provisions several Cloudflare One settings so you do not have to configure them manually:

### Existing Cloudflare One accounts

If your account already has a Cloudflare One deployment, the setup wizard will not overwrite your existing configuration. Verify the following settings are enabled for Mesh to work:

* **Device enrollment** — At least one [enrollment rule](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/cloudflare-one-client/deployment/device-enrollment/) must exist so that devices and nodes can register with your account.
* **Device profile for Mesh nodes** — Your Mesh nodes need a [device profile](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/cloudflare-one-client/configure/route-traffic/split-tunnels/) that uses **Include mode** with the Mesh IP range (`100.96.0.0/12`) included. If your nodes use Exclude mode instead, remove `100.64.0.0/10` (the default CGNAT exclusion) from the exclude list.
* **Mesh connectivity** — In your device profile settings, enable [Allow all Cloudflare One traffic to reach enrolled devices](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/cloudflare-one-client/configure/settings/#allow-all-cloudflare-one-traffic-to-reach-enrolled-devices).
* **Unique device IPs** — Enable [Assign a unique IP address to each device](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/cloudflare-one-client/configure/settings/#assign-a-unique-ip-address-to-each-device) so that each participant gets a routable Mesh IP.
* **Client mode** — Mesh nodes must run in [Traffic and DNS mode](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/cloudflare-one-client/configure/modes/). DNS-only or proxy-only modes are not supported.
* **Traffic proxying** — Enable the [Gateway proxy](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/traffic-policies/proxy/) for TCP, UDP, and ICMP so that Mesh traffic can flow between devices.

## Troubleshooting

* **Node shows as Offline** — On the server, run `warp-cli status`. If the output does not show `Status update: Connected`:  
  * Run `warp-cli connect`.
  * If your private network uses a firewall to restrict Internet traffic, ensure that it allows the [WARP ports and IPs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/cloudflare-one-client/deployment/firewall/).
  * Review your [WARP daemon logs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/cloudflare-one-client/troubleshooting/diagnostic-logs/) for information about why the connection is failing.
* **Client device cannot reach Mesh IPs** — Verify that your Split Tunnel configuration routes the Mesh IP range (`100.96.0.0/12`) through Cloudflare. For details, refer to [Connect client devices](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-mesh/client-devices/).
* **Windows firewall blocks Mesh traffic** — Windows Firewall blocks inbound traffic from `100.96.0.0/12` by default. Add a firewall rule that allows incoming requests from this range for your desired protocols and ports.

For general client issues, refer to [Troubleshoot the Cloudflare One Client](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/cloudflare-one-client/troubleshooting/).
