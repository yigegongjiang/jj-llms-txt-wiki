# Metrics

Last updated Apr 17, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-tunnel/monitor-tunnels/metrics/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Tunnel metrics show a Cloudflare Tunnel's throughput and resource usage over time. When you run a tunnel, `cloudflared` will spin up a Prometheus metrics endpoint — an HTTP server that exposes metrics in [Prometheus ↗](https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/) format. You can use the Prometheus toolkit on a remote machine to scrape metrics data from the `cloudflared` server.

## Default metrics server address

In non-containerized environments, `cloudflared` starts the metrics server on `127.0.0.1:<PORT>/metrics`, where `<PORT>` is the first available port in the range `20241` to `20245`. If all ports are unavailable, `cloudflared` binds to a random port. In containerized environments (Docker, Kubernetes), the default address is `0.0.0.0:<PORT>/metrics`.

To determine the default port, check your [tunnel logs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-tunnel/monitor-tunnels/logs/) around the time when the tunnel started. For example:

```text
2024-12-19T21:17:58Z INF Starting metrics server on 127.0.0.1:20241/metrics
```

## Configure the metrics server address

To serve metrics on a custom IP address and port, perform these steps on the `cloudflared` host:

1. [Run the tunnel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-tunnel/configure-tunnels/run-parameters/#add-run-parameters-to-tunnel-service) using the `--metrics` flag. For example,  
```sh  
cloudflared tunnel --metrics 127.0.0.1:60123 run my-tunnel  
```  
Note  
If you plan to fetch metrics from another machine on the local network, replace `127.0.0.1` with the internal IP of the `cloudflared` server (for example, `198.168.x.x`). To serve metrics on all available network interfaces, use `0.0.0.0`.
2. Verify that the metrics server is running by going to `http://localhost:60123/metrics`. This will only work if you configured a localhost IP (`127.0.0.1` or `0.0.0.0`).

You can now export the metrics to Prometheus and Grafana to visualize and query the data. Refer to the [Grafana tutorial](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/tutorials/grafana/) for instructions on getting started with these tools.
