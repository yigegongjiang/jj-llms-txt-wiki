# Deploy cloudflared replicas

Last updated Apr 17, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-tunnel/configure-tunnels/tunnel-availability/deploy-replicas/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

To deploy multiple instances of `cloudflared`, you can create and configure one tunnel and run it on multiple hosts. If your tunnel runs as a service, only one `cloudflared` instance is allowed per host.

You can run the same tunnel across various `cloudflared` processes for up to 100 connections (25 replicas) per tunnel. Cloudflare Load Balancers and DNS records can still point to the tunnel and its UUID. Traffic will be sent to all `cloudflared` processes associated with the tunnel.

Deploy replicas in Kubernetes

For information about running `cloudflared` in a Kubernetes deployment, refer to the [Kubernetes guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-tunnel/deployment-guides/kubernetes/).

## Remotely-managed tunnels

1. To create a remotely-managed tunnel, follow the [dashboard setup guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-tunnel/get-started/create-remote-tunnel/).
2. On the **Tunnels** page, select your newly created tunnel. The tunnel overview page displays all active replicas.
3. Select **Edit**.
4. Select the operating system of the host where you want to deploy a replica.
5. Copy the installation command and run it on the host.

The new replica will appear on the tunnel overview page. All replicas serve the same routes and use the same configuration parameters.

## Locally-managed tunnels

1. To create a locally-managed tunnel, complete Steps 1 through 5 in the [CLI setup guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-tunnel/do-more-with-tunnels/local-management/create-local-tunnel/).
2. Run your newly created tunnel.  
```sh  
cloudflared tunnel run <NAME>  
```  
This will start a `cloudflared` instance and generate a unique `connector_id`.
3. In a separate window or on another host, run the same command again:  
```sh  
cloudflared tunnel run <NAME>  
```  
This will initialize another `cloudflared` instance and generate another `connector_id`.
4. Run `tunnel info` to show each `cloudflared` instance running your tunnel:  
```sh  
cloudflared tunnel info <NAME>  
```

This will output your tunnel UUID as well as two Connector IDs, one for each `cloudflared` process running your tunnel. With this command, you can also see that your tunnel is now being served by eight connections.
