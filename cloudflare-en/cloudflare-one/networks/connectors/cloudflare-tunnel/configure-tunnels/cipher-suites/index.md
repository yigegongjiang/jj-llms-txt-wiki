# Cipher suites

Last updated Apr 17, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-tunnel/configure-tunnels/cipher-suites/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Cloudflare Tunnel connections use the cipher suites supported by `cloudflared`, which relies on the Go TLS library for its TLS implementation. These cipher suites apply to both the TLS connection between Cloudflare's network and `cloudflared`, and the HTTPS connection between `cloudflared` and your origin. In both cases, `cloudflared` negotiates the most secure cipher suite supported by both sides. All tunnel connections use TLS 1.3 and post-quantum encryption by default.

The following table lists the cipher suites supported by `cloudflared`:

| Protocol support            | Cipher suites                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
