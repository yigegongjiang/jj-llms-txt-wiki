# DNS records

Last updated Apr 17, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-tunnel/routing-to-tunnel/dns/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

When you create a tunnel, Cloudflare generates a subdomain at `<UUID>.cfargotunnel.com`. You point a CNAME record at this subdomain to route traffic from your hostname to the tunnel.

The `cfargotunnel.com` subdomain only proxies traffic for DNS records in the same Cloudflare account. If someone discovers your tunnel UUID, they cannot create a DNS record in another account to proxy traffic through it.

## Create a DNS record

To create a DNS record for a Cloudflare Tunnel:

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) and go to **DNS Records** for your domain.  
[Go to **Records** ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/:zone/dns/records)
2. Select **Add record**.
3. Enter the following values:

  * **Type**: _CNAME_
  * **Name**: Subdomain of your application
  * **Target**: `<UUID>.cfargotunnel.com`
4. Select **Save**.

For locally-managed tunnels, run the following command to create a CNAME record pointing to your tunnel subdomain:

```sh
cloudflared tunnel route dns <UUID or NAME> www.app.com
```

This creates a CNAME record but does not proxy traffic unless the tunnel is running.

Note

To create DNS records using `cloudflared`, the [cert.pem](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-tunnel/do-more-with-tunnels/local-management/local-tunnel-terms/#certpem) file must be installed on your system.

The DNS record and the tunnel are independent. You can create DNS records that point to a tunnel that is not running. If a tunnel stops, the DNS record is not deleted — visitors will see a `1016` error.

You can also create multiple DNS records pointing to the same tunnel subdomain. If you route traffic from multiple hostnames to multiple services, create a CNAME entry for each hostname. All entries share the same target.

## Cloudflare settings

Published applications inherit the Cloudflare settings for their hostname, including [cache rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cache/how-to/cache-rules/), [WAF rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/), and other [Rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/) configurations. You can change these settings for each hostname in the [Cloudflare dashboard ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/).

If you use a load balancer, settings are applied to the load balancer hostname instead.
