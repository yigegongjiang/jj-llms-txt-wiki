# Ubiquiti

Last updated Aug 24, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-wan/configuration/third-party/ubiquiti/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Connect a Ubiquiti UniFi Gateway to Cloudflare's network using Cloudflare WAN (formerly Magic WAN). These steps use the Cloud Gateway Max (UCG-Max) but work with other UniFi gateways supporting route-based IPsec (Internet Protocol Security) VPNs (Virtual Private Networks), like the Dream Machine series.

## Prerequisites

* Cloudflare account with Cloudflare WAN enabled (contact your account team)
* UniFi Cloud Gateway or Dream Machine with IPsec support
* UniFi Network Application (self-hosted or cloud)
* Static public IP from your ISP
* Admin access to both Cloudflare and UniFi
* Gather a **Magic Anycast IPv4** address from the **Leased IPs** section in the dashboard  
  * [Go to **Address space** ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/ip-addresses/address-space)
  * Contact your account team if you do not see any IP addresses listed.

## 1\. Configure Cloudflare WAN

1. Log in to [Cloudflare One ↗](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/), and go to **Networks**.
2. Go to **Connectors** \> **Cloudflare WAN**, and select **Create**.
3. Select **IPsec tunnel** \> **Next**, and fill in the following settings:

  * **Name**: `unifi-gw-primary`
  * **IPv4 Interface Address**: `10.252.2.28/31` or refer to the [Tunnel endpoints documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-wan/configuration/how-to/configure-tunnel-endpoints/)
  * **Customer Endpoint**: This should be your UniFi Gateway's WAN IP (for example, `203.0.113.10`)
  * **Cloudflare Endpoint**: This should be one of the IPv4 addresses gathered from Leased IPs.
  * Under **Tunnel Health checks**, select:  
    * **Health check rate**: Set to desired level
    * **Health check type**: _Request_
    * **Health check direction**: _Bidirectional_
    * **Health check target**: _Default_
  * Under **Pre-shared key**:  
    * Select **Add pre-shared key later**. This key will be given during the UniFi site-to-site VPN configuration.

## 2\. Configure site-to-site VPN on UniFi

1. In UniFi Network, go to **Settings** \> **VPN** \> **Site-to-Site VPN**.
2. Select **Create New**.
3. Configure the following settings:  
  * **VPN Type:** `IPsec`.
  * **Name:** `Cloudflare-Magic-WAN`.
  * **Pre-shared key:** Copy this key. You need it for the IPsec tunnel.
  * **Local IP:** Select the WAN interface (for example, `WAN1`).
  * **Remote IP:** Enter the Cloudflare endpoint IP from [Step 1](#1-configure-cloudflare-wan).
  * **VPN Method:** Route Based.
  * **Tunnel IP:** `10.252.2.29/31` or refer to the [Tunnel endpoints documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-wan/configuration/how-to/configure-tunnel-endpoints/).
  * **Remote Networks:** Inside Cloudflare tunnel address (for example, `10.252.2.28/31`) and other remote subnets to access through Cloudflare WAN.
4. Set Advanced settings:  
  * **Key Exchange Version**: IKEv2.
  * **IKE Encryption**: AES-256.
  * **IKE Hash**: SHA256.
  * **IKE DH Group**: 14.
  * **IKE Lifetime**: 28800.
  * **ESP Encryption**: AES-256.
  * **ESP Hash**: SHA256.
  * **ESP DH Group**: 14.
  * **ESP Lifetime**: 28800.
  * **PFS**: Enabled.
  * **Local Authentication ID**: Auto.
  * **Remote Authentication ID**: Uncheck **Auto**, and enter the Cloudflare Endpoint IP from [Step 1](#1-configure-cloudflare-wan).
  * **MTU**: 1436.
5. Select **Apply**

## 3\. Add pre-shared key to Cloudflare

1. Log in to [Cloudflare One ↗](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/), and go to **Networks**.
2. In **Cloudflare WAN**, find the IPsec tunnel you have just created.
3. Select your tunnel and then **Edit**.
4. Paste the preshared key from [Step 2](#2-configure-site-to-site-vpn-on-unifi).
5. Select **Save**.

## 4\. Configure Routes

1. Log in to [Cloudflare One ↗](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/), and go to **Networks**.
2. Go to **Routes** \> **WAN routes** \> **Create**.
3. Enter the following settings:

  * **Prefix**: Your local network (for example, `192.168.1.0/24`).
  * **Tunnel/Next hop**: Select your tunnel.
  * **Priority**: `100`.
4. Select **Add routes** to add your static route.

## Verify connections

Wait a few minutes, then access both Cloudflare and UniFi to verify the tunnel's status:

Cloudflare

1. Log in to [Cloudflare One ↗](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/), and go to **Insights**.
2. Go to **Network visibility** \> **WAN connector health**.
3. Find the tunnel you have just created and make sure its status shows **Up**. Refer to [Check tunnel health in the dashboard](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-wan/configuration/common-settings/check-tunnel-health-dashboard/) for more information.

UniFi

Go to **Settings** \> **VPN**, and make sure the status is **Connected**.

## Troubleshooting

**Tunnel down:**

* Verify Peer IP, pre-shared key, and IPsec settings match on both sides
* Check that the ISP is not blocking UDP ports `500`/`4500`

**Traffic not routing:**

* Verify Remote Subnets setting in UniFi VPN configuration
* Check firewall rules are not blocking VPN traffic

**Health check fails:**

* Allow ICMP from Cloudflare to the customer-side tunnel IP
* Target should be the `/31` interface IP, not your LAN gateway

## Policy-based routing

To route only specific devices through Cloudflare (UniFi Network Application):

1. Remove unnecessary routes from Remote Subnets in your VPN configuration.
2. Go to **Settings** \> **Policy Table**.
3. Under **Policy Engine** select **Create New Policy** with the following settings:  
  * Select `Route`.
  * **Name**: Provide a name for the policy.
  * **Type**: _Policy-Based_.
  * **Interface/VPN Tunnel**: Select the VPN Tunnel (for example, `Cloudflare-Magic-WAN`).
  * **Kill Switch**: _Enabled_ (recommended).
  * **Source**: Select `Device/Network` and then choose the Device(s) or Network(s).
  * **Destination**: _Any_.
  * **Interface**: Your VPN tunnel.

## Next Steps

* Use [Cloudflare Network Firewall](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-network-firewall/) for network policies.
* Configure a second tunnel for redundancy.
* Monitor traffic in the Cloudflare WAN dashboard.

You are now routing traffic through Cloudflare's network using Cloudflare WAN.
