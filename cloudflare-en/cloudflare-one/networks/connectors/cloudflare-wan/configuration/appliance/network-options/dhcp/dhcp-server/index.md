# DHCP server

Last updated Apr 17, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-wan/configuration/appliance/network-options/dhcp/dhcp-server/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

When you use a static IP address, Cloudflare One Appliance (formerly Magic WAN Connector) can also act as a DHCP server in your network. To enable this feature:

1. Log in to [Cloudflare One](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/), and go to **Networks**.
2. Go to **Connectors** \> **Appliances** \> **Profiles**.
1. Select the Cloudflare One Appliance you want to configure > **Edit**.
2. Select **Network Configuration** \> **LAN configuration**.
3. In **LAN configuration**, select the LAN where you want to enable DHCP server.
4. Select **Edit**.
5. Under **Static addressing**, select **This is a DHCP Server**. You also have to specify:
  * The DNS server address. You can have more than one IP address. Select **Add DNS Server** for each server you want to add.
  * The DHCP pool start
  * The DHCP pool end

Note

You will need your [account ID](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/account/find-account-and-zone-ids/) and [API token](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/get-started/account-owned-tokens/) to use the API.

Create a [PUT request](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/magic%5Ftransit/subresources/sites/subresources/lans/methods/update/) to update the LAN where you want to enable DHCP server:

Example:

Required API token permissions

At least one of the following [token permissions](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/reference/permissions/) is required:
* `Magic WAN Write`
* `Magic Transit Write`

```bash
curl "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/$ACCOUNT_ID/magic/sites/$SITE_ID/lans/$LAN_ID" \
	--request PUT \
	--header "Authorization: Bearer $CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN" \
	--json '{
		"lan": {
				"static_addressing": {
						"dhcp_server": {
								"dhcp_pool_end": "<IP_ADDRESS>",
								"dhcp_pool_start": "<IP_ADDRESS>",
								"dns_server": "<IP_ADDRESS>"
						}
				}
		}
	}'
```
