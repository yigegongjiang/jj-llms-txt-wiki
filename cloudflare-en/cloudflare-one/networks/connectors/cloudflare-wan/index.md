# Cloudflare WAN

Last updated Apr 21, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-wan/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Connect and secure your entire corporate network through Cloudflare, replacing MPLS circuits and hub-and-spoke routing with cloud-native networking.

Enterprise-only

Cloudflare WAN (formerly Magic WAN) connects your data centers, offices, and cloud resources through Cloudflare's global network. Instead of backhauling traffic through a central data center or maintaining dedicated MPLS circuits at every site, your traffic routes through the nearest Cloudflare data center where security policies apply inline.

Cloudflare WAN provides secure, performant [routing ↗](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-routing/) for your entire corporate network. [Cloudflare Network Firewall](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-network-firewall/) integrates with Cloudflare WAN, enabling you to enforce network firewall policies at Cloudflare's global network, across traffic from any entity within your network.

You connect your sites to Cloudflare through on-ramps — tunnels or direct connections from your network to Cloudflare. Cloudflare WAN supports any device that uses anycastGRE or IPsec tunnels. Refer to [On-ramps](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-wan/on-ramps/) for a full list of supported on-ramps.

## Features

[Connect your network automatically](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-wan/configuration/appliance/)

Use Cloudflare One Appliance to automatically connect and steer any IP traffic.

Use Cloudflare One Appliance

[Connect your network manually](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-wan/configuration/third-party/)

Set up Cloudflare WAN with your existing routers and firewalls. If you do not have Cloudflare One Appliance, start here to configure IPsec or GRE tunnels from a third-party device.

Use a third-party device

[Zero Trust integration](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-wan/zero-trust/)

Learn how you can use Cloudflare WAN with other Cloudflare Zero Trust products.

Integrate with other Zero Trust products

[BGP peering (beta)](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-wan/configuration/how-to/configure-routes/#configure-bgp-routes)

Use Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) peering between your networks and Cloudflare to automatically announce and withdraw routes as your network changes, rather than managing static routes manually.

Use BGP peering (beta)

[WAN transformation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-wan/wan-transformation/)

Replace MPLS circuits and hub-and-spoke routing with cloud-native networking. Compare WAN approaches and plan an incremental migration.

Plan your migration

[Virtual networks](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/virtual-networks/)

Understand how virtual networks provide routing isolation within your Cloudflare account, keeping traffic separated between environments, partners, or applications.

[Cloudflare Network Firewall](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-network-firewall/)

Cloudflare Network Firewall is a firewall-as-a-service (FWaaS) that filters traffic at layers 3 and 4 across Cloudflare's global network. Included with Cloudflare WAN.

[Cloudflare Network Interconnect](https://developers.cloudflare.com/network-interconnect/)

Cloudflare Network Interconnect (CNI) provides a private, dedicated connection between your network and Cloudflare instead of routing over the public Internet. Use CNI when you need lower latency or more consistent performance than tunnel-based connectivity.

[Load Balancing](https://developers.cloudflare.com/load-balancing/)

Cloudflare Load Balancing distributes traffic across your endpoints, which reduces endpoint strain and latency and improves the experience for end users.
