# Applications and app types

Last updated Apr 22, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/traffic-policies/application-app-types/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Gateway allows you to create DNS, Network, and HTTP policies based on applications and application types. Because a single application often spans multiple hostnames, selecting an application by name is easier than writing separate rules for each hostname. You can select individual applications or application types to filter specific traffic on your network.

## Applications

When you choose the _Application_ selector in a Gateway policy builder, the **Value** field will include all supported applications and their respective app types. Alternatively, you can use the [Gateway API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/zero%5Ftrust/subresources/gateway/subresources/app%5Ftypes/methods/list/) to fetch a list of applications, app types, and ID numbers.

To manage a consolidated list of applications across Cloudflare One, you can use the [Application Library](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/app-library/).

## App types

Gateway sorts applications into the following app type groups:

| Value                                          | Definition                                                                                                                                                   |

| [Do Not Inspect](#do-not-inspect-applications) | Applications incompatible with the TLS certificate required by the [Gateway proxy](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/traffic-policies/proxy/) |

## Application hostnames

An application like Google Drive uses its own hostnames (for example, `drive.google.com`) and shared resources used by other applications (for example, `accounts.google.com` for login). Gateway separates these into [hostnames](#hostnames) and [support hostnames](#support-hostnames) so you can control the behavior of each application independently.

### Hostnames

Hostnames are domains that are core to the application and not [used by other applications](#overlapping-hostnames). These are the domains that Gateway blocks when you block an application. The App Library surfaces these hostnames in the [Hostnames table](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/app-library/#overview) for an application.

### Support hostnames

Support hostnames are shared resources that applications depend on for content delivery, authentication, or third-party integrations. Because multiple applications share these hostnames, blocking them can cause unexpected side effects.

For example, assume that `file-sharing-service.com` relies on `content-delivery.com`. If you allow access to `file-sharing-service.com` and its associated subdomains but not `content-delivery.com`, some of the functionality of `file-sharing-service.com` may break when Gateway matches the traffic.

To prevent this, Gateway only uses support hostnames in Allow policies — it will allow support hostname connections but will not block them. For example, many Google applications use `accounts.google.com` for authentication. If you create an Allow policy for an application that lists `accounts.google.com` as a support hostname, Gateway will allow both `accounts.google.com` and the application's own domains.

## Application controls

When you use the [_Application_ selector](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/traffic-policies/http-policies/#granular-controls) in an HTTP policy with the _is_ operator, you can choose specific actions and operations to match application traffic. Supported applications and operations include:

Artificial Intelligence

* ChatGPT
* Google Gemini
* Perplexity
* Claude

File Sharing

* Box
* Dropbox
* Google Drive
* WeTransfer
* Hightail
* ShareFile
* Smash

For more information, refer to [Application Granular Controls](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/traffic-policies/http-policies/granular-controls/).

## Usage

### Overlapping hostnames

Overlapping hostnames are most common for vendors with many applications, such as Google or Meta. When you use the Application selector in Gateway policies, actions taken by Gateway will be limited to the specific application defined. Gateway will also log other applications that use the same hostnames, but it will not take action unless the application was matched by the policy. For example, both the Facebook and Facebook Messenger apps use the `chat-e2ee.facebook.com` hostname. When evaluating traffic to the Facebook Messenger app, Gateway will only take action on Facebook Messenger traffic but may log both the Facebook and Facebook Messenger apps.

To ensure Gateway evaluates traffic with your desired precedence, order your most specific policies with the highest priority according to [order of precedence](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/traffic-policies/order-of-enforcement/#priority-within-a-policy-builder).

### Do Not Inspect applications

Gateway automatically groups applications incompatible with TLS decryption into the _Do Not Inspect_ app type. As Cloudflare identifies incompatible applications, Gateway will periodically update this app type to add new applications. To ensure Gateway does not intercept any current or future incompatible traffic, you can [create a Do Not Inspect HTTP policy](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/traffic-policies/http-policies/#do-not-inspect) with the entire _Do Not Inspect_ app type selected.

When managing applications with the [Application Library](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/app-library/), Do Not Inspect applications will appear under the corresponding application. For example, the App Library will group _Google Drive (Do Not Inspect)_ under **Google Drive**.

Install Cloudflare certificate manually to allow TLS decryption

Instead of creating a Do Not Inspect policy for an application, you may be able to configure the application to [trust a Cloudflare certificate](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/user-side-certificates/manual-deployment/#add-the-certificate-to-applications). Doing so will allow the application to function without losing visibility into your traffic.

#### TLS decryption limitations

Applications can be incompatible with [TLS decryption](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/traffic-policies/http-policies/tls-decryption/) for various reasons:

* **Certificate pinning**: Certificate pinning is a security mechanism used to prevent on-path attacks on the Internet by hardcoding information about the certificate that the application expects to receive. If the wrong certificate is received, even if it is trusted by the system, the application will refuse to connect.
* **Non-web traffic**: Some applications send non-web traffic over TLS, such as Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) for voice and video calls and Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) for chat. Gateway cannot inspect these protocols.

#### Microsoft 365 integration

To optimize performance for Microsoft 365 applications and services, you can bypass TLS decryption by turning on the Microsoft 365 traffic integration. This will create a [Do Not Inspect policy](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/traffic-policies/http-policies/#do-not-inspect) for all [Microsoft 365 domains and IP addresses ↗](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/enterprise/microsoft-365-ip-web-service) specified by Microsoft. This policy also uses Cloudflare intelligence to identify other Microsoft 365 traffic not explicitly defined.

To turn on the Microsoft 365 integration:

1. In the [Cloudflare dashboard ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/), go to **Zero Trust** \> **Traffic policies** \> **Traffic settings** \> **Policy settings**.
2. In **Bypass decryption of Microsoft 365 traffic**, select **Create policy**.
3. To verify the policy was created, select **View policy**. Alternatively, go to **Traffic policies** \> **HTTP policies**. A policy named Microsoft 365 Auto Generated will be enabled in your list.

All future Microsoft 365 traffic will bypass Gateway logging and filtering. To disable this behavior, turn off or delete the policy.

### Terraform

Terraform users can retrieve the app types list with the `cloudflare_zero_trust_gateway_app_types_list` data source. This allows you to create Gateway policies with the application's name rather than its numeric ID. For example:

```tf
data "cloudflare_zero_trust_gateway_app_types_list" "gateway_apptypes" {
  account_id = var.cloudflare_account_id
}

locals {
  apptypes_map = merge([
    for c in data.cloudflare_zero_trust_gateway_app_types_list.gateway_apptypes.result :
    { (c.name) = c.id }
  ]...)
}

resource "cloudflare_zero_trust_gateway_policy" "zt_block_dns_apps" {
  account_id = var.cloudflare_account_id
  name       = "DNS Blocked apps"
  action     = "block"
  traffic    = "any(app.ids[*] in {${join(" ", [
    local.apptypes_map["Discord"],
    local.apptypes_map["GoToMeeting"],
    local.apptypes_map["Greenhouse"],
    local.apptypes_map["Zelle"],
    local.apptypes_map["Microsoft Visual Studio"]
  ])}})"
}
```
