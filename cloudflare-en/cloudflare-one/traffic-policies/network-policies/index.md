# Network policies

Last updated Apr 17, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/traffic-policies/network-policies/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Note

To enable this feature, download and deploy the [Cloudflare One Client](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/cloudflare-one-client/deployment/) on your devices.

Network policies control TCP and UDP traffic between your users and network destinations. Use them to allow or block non-HTTP traffic such as SSH, RDP, and database connections based on IP addresses, ports, and protocols.

Because Cloudflare One [integrates with your identity provider](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/integrations/identity-providers/), you can also create identity-based network policies. This allows you to control access to non-HTTP resources on a per-user basis regardless of the user's location or device.

A network policy consists of an **Action** and a logical expression that determines the scope of the action. To build an expression, choose a **Selector** and an **Operator**, then enter a value or range of values in the **Value** field. You can use **And** and **Or** logical operators to evaluate multiple conditions.

* [Actions](#actions)
* [Selectors](#selectors)
* [Comparison operators](#comparison-operators)
* [Value](#value)
* [Logical operators](#logical-operators)

If a condition in an expression joins a query attribute (such as _Source IP_) and a response attribute (such as _Resolved IP_), then the condition will be evaluated when the response is received.

Terraform provider v4 precedence limitation

To avoid conflicts, version 4 of the Terraform Cloudflare provider applies a hash calculation to policy precedence. For example, a precedence of `1000` may become `1000901`. This can cause errors when reordering policies. To avoid this issue, manually set the precedence of policies created with Terraform using the [Update a Zero Trust Gateway rule](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/zero%5Ftrust/subresources/gateway/subresources/rules/methods/update/) endpoint.

To ensure your precedence is set correctly, Cloudflare recommends [upgrading your Terraform provider to version 5 ↗](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/cloudflare/cloudflare/latest/docs/guides/version-5-upgrade).

## Actions

Like actions in DNS and HTTP policies, actions in network policies define which decision you want to apply to a given set of elements. You can assign one action per policy.

### Allow

API value: `allow`

Available selectors

**Traffic**

* [Access Infrastructure Target](#access-infrastructure-target)
* [Access Private App](#access-private-app)
* [Application](#application)
* [Content Categories](#content-categories)
* [Destination Continent IP Geolocation](#destination-continent)

**Device Posture**

* [Passed Device Posture Checks](#device-posture)

Policies with Allow actions allow network traffic to reach certain IPs or ports. In a default-block configuration, Allow policies define the exceptions — traffic that does not match an Allow policy will be blocked by a lower-priority catch-all Block policy. For example, the following configuration allows specific users to reach a given IP address:

| Selector       | Operator | Value          | Logic | Action |
| -------------- | -------- | -------------- | ----- | ------ |
| Destination IP | in       | 92.100.02.102  | And   | Allow  |
| Email          | in       | \*@example.com |       |        |

### Audit SSH Deprecated

API value: `audit_ssh`

Available selectors

**Traffic**

* [Application](#application)
* [Destination Continent IP Geolocation](#destination-continent)
* [Destination Country IP Geolocation](#destination-country)
* [Destination IP](#destination-ip)
* [Source Continent IP Geolocation](#source-continent)
* [Source Country IP Geolocation](#source-country)
* [Source Internal IP](#source-internal-ip)
* [Source IP](#source-ip)
* [Source Port](#source-port)
* [Virtual Network](#virtual-network)

**Identity**

* [SAML Attributes](#users)
* [User Email](#users)
* [User Group Emails](#users)
* [User Group IDs](#users)
* [User Group Names](#users)
* [User Name](#users)

**Device Posture**

* [Passed Device Posture Checks](#device-posture)

Caution

Gateway no longer supports the Audit SSH action for new policies. To log your SSH traffic, Cloudflare recommends deploying [Access for Infrastructure](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-tunnel/use-cases/ssh/ssh-infrastructure-access/) for your SSH server and configuring [SSH command logs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-tunnel/use-cases/ssh/ssh-infrastructure-access/#ssh-command-logs).

Policies with Audit SSH actions allow administrators to log SSH traffic. Gateway will detect SSH traffic over port `22`. For example, the following configuration logs SSH commands sent to a given IP address:

| Selector       | Operator | Value        | Action    |
| -------------- | -------- | ------------ | --------- |
| Destination IP | in       | 203.0.113.83 | Audit SSH |

Gateway only audits SSH traffic over port `22`. Non-standard ports, including those specified with the [Destination Port selector](#destination-port), are not supported.

For more information on SSH logging, refer to [Configure SSH proxy and command logs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/traffic-policies/network-policies/ssh-logging/).

Policies with Block actions block network traffic from reaching certain IPs or ports. For example, the following configuration blocks all traffic directed to port 443:

| Selector         | Operator | Value | Action |
| ---------------- | -------- | ----- | ------ |
| Destination Port | in       | 443   | Block  |

Turn on **Display block notification for Cloudflare One Client** to display notifications for Gateway block events. Blocked users will receive an operating system notification from the Cloudflare One Client with a custom message you set. If you do not set a custom message, the Cloudflare One Client will display a default message. Custom messages must be 100 characters or less. The Cloudflare One Client will only display one notification per minute.

Upon selecting the notification, the Cloudflare One Client will direct your users to the [Gateway block page](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/reusable-components/custom-pages/gateway-block-page/) you have configured. Optionally, you can direct users to a custom URL, such as an internal support form.

When you turn on **Send policy context**, Gateway will append details of the matching request to the redirected URL as a query string. Not every context field will be included. Potential policy context fields include:

Ensure that your operating system allows notifications for the Cloudflare One Client. Your device may not display notifications if focus, do not disturb, or screen sharing settings are turned on. To turn on client notifications on macOS devices running DisplayLink software, you may have to allow system notifications when mirroring your display. For more information, refer to the [macOS documentation ↗](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/change-notifications-settings-mh40583/mac).

### Network Override

Available selectors

**Traffic**

* [Destination Continent IP Geolocation](#destination-continent)
* [Destination Country IP Geolocation](#destination-country)
* [Destination IP](#destination-ip)
* [Destination Port](#destination-port)
* [Protocol](#protocol)
* [SNI](#sni)
* [SNI Domain](#sni-domain)
* [Source Continent IP Geolocation](#source-continent)
* [Source Country IP Geolocation](#source-country)

* [User Group Emails](#users)
* [User Group IDs](#users)
* [User Group Names](#users)
* [User Name](#users)

**Device Posture**

* [Passed Device Posture Checks](#device-posture)

Policies with Network Override actions override traffic directed to or coming from certain IPv4/IPv6 addresses or ports. Destination IPs can be public IPs or private IPs connected to your Zero Trust network. For example, the following configuration overrides traffic sent to a public IP with a private IP based on a user's identity:

| Selector       | Operator | Value          | Logic | Action           |
| -------------- | -------- | -------------- | ----- | ---------------- |
| Destination IP | in       | 95.92.143.151  | And   | Network Override |
| User Email     | in       | \*@example.com | And   |                  |
| Override IP    |          | 10.0.0.1       |       |                  |

Caution

If the override destination IP is unreachable, Gateway still rewrites the destination but does not log the connection. The traffic fails silently with no log entry. Verify that your override IP is reachable before deploying this policy.

Gateway will only log successful override connections in your [network logs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/insights/logs/dashboard-logs/gateway-logs/#network-logs).

## Selectors

Gateway matches network traffic against the following selectors, or criteria.

### Access Infrastructure Target

| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Security Categories | any(net.fqdn.security\_category\[\*\] in {1}) |

### SNI

Server Name Indication (SNI) is the hostname a client sends during the TLS handshake, before encryption begins. Gateway reads the SNI to identify the destination of encrypted traffic. The SNI selector matches the exact hostname.

By default, SNI selectors only apply to HTTPS traffic on port `443`. To inspect traffic on every port, turn on [protocol detection](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/traffic-policies/network-policies/protocol-detection/) and choose to [inspect on all ports](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/traffic-policies/network-policies/protocol-detection/#inspect-on-all-ports).

| UI name | API example                       |
| ------- | --------------------------------- |
| SNI     | net.sni.host == "www.example.com" |

### SNI Domain

The domain whose Server Name Indication (SNI) header Gateway will filter traffic against. For example, a rule for `example.com` will match `example.com`, `www.example.com`, and `my.test.example.com`.

By default, SNI selectors only apply to HTTPS traffic on port `443`. To inspect traffic on every port, turn on [protocol detection](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/traffic-policies/network-policies/protocol-detection/) and choose to [inspect on all ports](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/traffic-policies/network-policies/protocol-detection/#inspect-on-all-ports).

| UI name    | API example                      |
| ---------- | -------------------------------- |
| SNI Domain | net.sni.domains == "example.com" |

### Source Continent

The continent of the user making the request. 

Geolocation is determined from the device's public IP address (typically assigned by the user's ISP). To specify a continent, enter its two-letter code into the **Value** field:

## Comparison operators

Comparison operators are the way Gateway matches traffic to a selector. When you choose a **Selector** in the dashboard policy builder, the **Operator** dropdown menu will display the available options for that selector.

| Operator                 | Meaning                                                                                                            |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| is                       | equals the defined value                                                                                           |
| is not                   | does not equal the defined value                                                                                   |
| in                       | matches at least one of the defined values                                                                         |
| not in                   | does not match any of the defined values                                                                           |
| in list                  | in a pre-defined [list](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/reusable-components/lists/) of values     |
| not in list              | not in a pre-defined [list](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/reusable-components/lists/) of values |
| matches regex            | regex evaluates to true                                                                                            |
| does not match regex     | regex evaluates to false                                                                                           |
| greater than             | exceeds the defined number                                                                                         |
| greater than or equal to | exceeds or equals the defined number                                                                               |
| less than                | below the defined number                                                                                           |
| less than or equal to    | below or equals the defined number                                                                                 |

Note

The _in_ operator allows you to specify IP addresses or networks using CIDR notation (for example, `10.0.0.0/8` matches all IPs from `10.0.0.0` to `10.255.255.255`).

## Value

In the **Value** field, you can input a single value when using an equality comparison operator (such as _is_) or multiple values when using a containment comparison operator (such as _in_). Additionally, you can use [regular expressions](#regular-expressions) (or regex) to specify a range of values for supported selectors.

### Regular expressions

Regular expressions are evaluated using Rust. The Rust implementation is slightly different than regex libraries used elsewhere. For more information, refer to our guide for [Wildcards](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/access-controls/policies/app-paths/#wildcards). To evaluate if your regex matches, you can use [Rustexp ↗](https://rustexp.lpil.uk/).

If you want to match multiple values, you can use the pipe symbol (`|`) as an OR operator. You do not need to use an escape character (`\`) before the pipe symbol. For example, the following expression evaluates to true when the SNI host matches either `.*whispersystems.org` or `.*signal.org`:

| Selector | Operator      | Value                                |
| -------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| SNI      | matches regex | .\*whispersystems.org\|.\*signal.org |

In addition to regular expressions, you can use [logical operators](#logical-operators) to match multiple values.

## Logical operators

To evaluate multiple conditions in an expression, select the **And** logical operator. These expressions can be compared further with the **Or** logical operator.

| Operator | Meaning                                       |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| And      | match all of the conditions in the expression |
| Or       | match any of the conditions in the expression |

The **Or** operator will only work with conditions in the same expression group. For example, you cannot compare conditions in **Traffic** with conditions in **Identity** or **Device Posture**.
