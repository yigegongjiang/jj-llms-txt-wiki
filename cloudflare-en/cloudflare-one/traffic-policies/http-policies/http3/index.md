# HTTP/3 inspection

Last updated Apr 22, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/traffic-policies/http-policies/http3/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

HTTP/3 uses the QUIC protocol over UDP instead of TCP. Because Gateway's default proxy only handles TCP traffic, HTTP/3 inspection requires turning on the UDP proxy. Without it, HTTP/3 traffic bypasses HTTP inspection. [Network policies](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/traffic-policies/network-policies/) still apply to the underlying UDP traffic.

Gateway applies HTTP policies to HTTP/3 traffic last. For more information, refer to the [order of enforcement](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/traffic-policies/order-of-enforcement/#http3-traffic).

## Turn on HTTP/3 inspection

Before you can inspect any HTTPS traffic, you must deploy a [user-side certificate](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/user-side-certificates/) to your devices and turn on [TLS decryption](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/traffic-policies/http-policies/tls-decryption/). To inspect HTTP/3 traffic, you must also turn on the [Gateway proxy](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/traffic-policies/proxy/) for UDP.

To turn on the Gateway proxy for UDP and TLS decryption:

1. In the [Cloudflare dashboard ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/), go to **Zero Trust** \> **Traffic policies** \> **Traffic settings**.
2. In **Proxy and inspection**, turn on **Allow Secure Web Gateway to proxy traffic**.
3. Select **TCP** and **UDP**.
4. Turn on **TLS decryption**.

### Application limitations

Gateway can inspect HTTP/3 traffic from Mozilla Firefox and Microsoft Edge by establishing an HTTP/3 proxy connection. Gateway will then terminate the HTTP/3 connection, decrypt and inspect the traffic, and connect to the destination server over HTTP/2\. Gateway can also inspect other HTTP applications, such as cURL.

If both the UDP proxy and TLS decryption are turned on, Google Chrome will automatically cancel HTTP/3 connections and retry them over HTTP/2, which Gateway can inspect. If either the UDP proxy or TLS decryption is turned off, HTTP/3 traffic from Chrome bypasses inspection entirely.

Caution

If you do not turn on the UDP proxy, HTTP/3 traffic from browsers other than Chrome will bypass HTTP policy enforcement. Network policies still apply.

## Exempt HTTP/3 traffic from inspection

If you require HTTP/3 traffic with end-to-end encryption from the client to the origin while still using the Gateway proxy, you can create a [Do Not Inspect HTTP policy](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/traffic-policies/http-policies/#do-not-inspect) to match the desired traffic. Using a Do Not Inspect policy allows HTTP/3 traffic to preserve proxy performance and end-to-end encryption by bypassing Gateway's TLS decryption and inspection.

## Force HTTP/2 traffic

To apply Gateway policies to HTTP traffic without turning on the UDP proxy, you must turn off QUIC in your users' browsers to ensure only HTTP/2 traffic reaches Gateway.

Google Chrome

1. Go to `chrome://flags`
2. Set **Experimental QUIC protocol** to _Disabled_.
3. Relaunch Chrome.

Safari

You cannot turn off QUIC in Safari. All traffic will be sent over HTTP/3.

Firefox

1. Go to `about:config`.
2. If you receive a warning, select **Accept the Risk and Continue**.
3. Set **network.http.http3.enable** to _false_.
4. Relaunch Firefox.

Microsoft Edge

1. Go to `edge://flags`
2. Set **Experimental QUIC protocol** to _Disabled_.
3. Relaunch Edge.
