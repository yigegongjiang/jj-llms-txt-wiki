# Traffic types

Last updated Apr 17, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/traffic-policies/packet-filtering/traffic-types/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Cloudflare Network Firewall enables you to allow or block traffic on a variety of packet characteristics, including:

* **Source and destination IP** — the sender's and receiver's IP addresses
* **Source and destination port** — the numeric port identifying the specific service (for example, port 80 for HTTP)
* **Protocol** — the communication method, such as TCP or UDP
* **Packet length** — the size of the packet in bytes
* **Bit field match** — inspect individual flags within packet headers

Cloudflare Network Firewall operates at OSI layers 3 and 4 — the network layer (IP addressing and routing) and transport layer (port-based connections). It supports protocols such as TCP (reliable, ordered connections), UDP (fast, connectionless messages), and ICMP (network diagnostic messages like ping). You can write rules against any layer 3 or 4 protocol, not only TCP and UDP.

To see the full list of fields you can use when writing filter expressions, refer to [Cloudflare Network Firewall fields](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-network-firewall/reference/network-firewall-fields/).
