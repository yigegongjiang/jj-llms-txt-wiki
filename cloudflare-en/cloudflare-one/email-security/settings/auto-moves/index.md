# Auto-move events

Last updated Apr 17, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/email-security/settings/auto-moves/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Auto-moves allow you to automatically move emails out of your inbox based on a [disposition](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/email-security/reference/dispositions-and-attributes/) that Email security assigns to each message (for example, malicious, spam, or spoof).

Use auto-moves to enforce email security policy without relying on end users to identify and act on threats themselves. After you configure auto-moves, Email security handles flagged messages according to the action you choose for each disposition.

To configure auto-move events:

1. Log in to [Cloudflare One ↗](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/).
2. Select **Email security**.
3. Select **Settings**.
4. Select **Moves**.
5. Under **Auto-moves**, select **Configure**.
6. For each disposition (malicious, spam, bulk, suspicious, spoof), choose what happens to matching emails:  
  * **Soft delete - user recoverable**: Moves the message to the user's **Recoverable Items - Deleted** folder. The user can still find and restore the message. This option is only available for Microsoft 365 customers. Refer to [Microsoft 365 Exchange data deletion ↗](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/compliance/assurance/assurance-exchange-online-data-deletion) for more information.
  * **Hard delete - admin recoverable**: Removes the message from the user's inbox entirely. Only an administrator can recover it.
  * **Move to trash**: Moves the message to the user's trash or deleted items folder. This option is only available for Google Workspace users.
  * **Move to junk**: Moves the message to the user's junk or spam folder.
  * **No action**: Leaves the message where it is. Email security still records the disposition, but does not move the message.
7. Select **Save**.
