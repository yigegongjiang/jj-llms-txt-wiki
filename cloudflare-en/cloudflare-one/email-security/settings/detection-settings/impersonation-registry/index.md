# Impersonation registry

Last updated Jun 5, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/email-security/settings/detection-settings/impersonation-registry/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

The impersonation registry contains combinations of emails of users who are likely to be impersonated. If there is an email that is on the impersonation registry not listed as an alternative email address, that email will be reported as potential [business email compromise (BEC) ↗](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/email-security/business-email-compromise-bec/).

Note

The impersonation registry should contain a list of users who are likely to be impersonated. Email security applies enhanced security to variations of registered email addresses for additional [Business Email Compromise (BEC) ↗](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/email-security/business-email-compromise-bec/) protection.

For easier tracking, the Email security team recommends syncing and structuring VIPs in groups, and avoid doing manual inputs of users.

To add a user to the impersonation registry:

1. Log in to [Cloudflare One ↗](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/).
2. Select **Email security**.
3. Select **Settings** \> **Impersonation registry**.
4. Select **Add a user**.
5. Select **Input method**: Choose between **Manual input**, **Upload manual list**, and **Select from existing directories**:  
  * **Manual input**: Enter the following information:  
    * **User info**: enter a valid **Display name**.
    * **User email**: Enter one of the following:  
      * **Email address**: Enter all known email addresses, separated by a comma.
      * **Regular expressions**: Must be valid Java expressions.
  * **Upload manual list**: You can upload a file no larger than 150 KB containing all variables of potential emails. The file must contain `Display_Name` and `Email`, and the first row must be the header row. Refer to [CSV uploads](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/email-security/settings/detection-settings/impersonation-registry/#csv-uploads) for an example file.
  * **Select from existing directories**:  
    * **Select directory**: Select your directory.
    * **Add users or groups**: Choose the users or groups you want to register.
6. Select **Save**.

### CSV uploads

You can upload a file no larger than 150 KB containing all variables of potential emails. The file must contain `Display_Name` and `Email`, and the first row must be the header row.

An example file would look like this:

```txt
Display Name, Email
Star Phish, star@nophish.com
Phish Ee, phishee@nophish.com
```

## Edit users
