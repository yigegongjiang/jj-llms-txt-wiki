Last updated Apr 17, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/email-security/setup/pre-delivery-deployment/prerequisites/m365-email-security-mx/use-cases/five-junk-admin-quarantine/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

In this tutorial, you will learn to deliver `BULK` messages to the user's junk email folder, and `MALICIOUS`, `SPAM`, and `SPOOF` messages to the Administrative Quarantine (this requires an administrator to release the emails).

## Configure anti-spam policies

2. Go to **Email & collaboration** \> **Policies & rules**.
3. Select **Threat policies**.
4. Under **Policies**, select **Anti-spam**.
5. Select the **Anti-spam inbound policy (Default)** text (not the checkbox).
6. In **Actions**, scroll down and select **Edit actions**.
7. Set the following conditions and actions (you might need to scroll up or down to find them):
* **Spam**: _Move messages to Junk Email folder_.
* **High confidence spam**: _Quarantine message_.  
  * **Select quarantine policy**: \_AdminOnlyAccessPolicy\_.
* **Phishing**: _Quarantine message_.  
  * **Select quarantine policy**: \_AdminOnlyAccessPolicy\_.
* **High confidence phishing**: _Quarantine message_.  
  * **Select quarantine policy**: \_AdminOnlyAccessPolicy\_.
* **Retain spam in quarantine for this many days**: Default is 15 days. Email security recommends 15-30 days.  
  * Select the spam actions in the above step.

    * **Enter text**: `X-CFEmailSecurity-Disposition` \> **Save**.
    * **Enter words**: `BULK` \> **Add** \> **Save**.
  * **Apply this rule if**: Select **+** to add a second condition.

  * **Do the following** \- _\_Modify the message properties\_ > \_Set the Spam Confidence Level (SCL)\_ > \_5\__.
5. Select **Next**.
