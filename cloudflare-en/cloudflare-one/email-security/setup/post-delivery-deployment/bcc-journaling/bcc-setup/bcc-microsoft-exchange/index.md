# Microsoft Exchange BCC setup

Last updated Apr 17, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/email-security/setup/post-delivery-deployment/bcc-journaling/bcc-setup/bcc-microsoft-exchange/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

For customers using Microsoft Exchange, setting up Email security via BCC is quick and easy. You need to configure an inbound rule to send emails to Email security via BCC for processing and detection of potential phishing attacks. The following email flow shows how this works:

Auto-moves for Microsoft Exchange customers

Microsoft Exchange customers can auto-move if your email service is on-premise and you are using Microsoft Exchange online.

## Configure Inbound Rule

1. Access Exchange's **Management Console**, and go to **Organization Configuration** \> **Hub Transport**.

2. On the **Actions** pane, select **New Transport Rule**.
3. Give the transport rule a name and a description and select **Next**.

5. Still in the same **Condition** configuration panel, add a second condition to the transport rule. Select **sent to users that are inside or outside the organization, or partners**. Keep the default value of **Inside the organization**.

7. In the **Action** configuration panel, select **Blind carbon copy (Bcc) the message to addresses**. Edit the **addresses** variable to add the addresses you want to copy as BCC.

10. Select **OK** \> **OK** to return to the main configuration page of the transport rule.
11. At the main configuration page of the transport rule, select **Next** to continue to the Exception configuration panel.

Note

If you have multiple rules, you may need to change the order of the BCC rule and move it to the right location in your rule sequence. This is needed so you can send BCC messages to Email security. Usually, the Email security BCC rule will be at the top of the ruleset. The configured conditions of the Email security BCC rule will only trigger for inbound messages.

## Email processing and reports

In BCC mode, all emails are put through automated phishing detections by Email security. Emails that trigger phishing detections are logged for reporting via product portal, email and Slack. Emails that do not trigger any detections are deleted.
