Last updated Apr 17, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/email-security/directories/manage-es-directories/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

You can manage your Email security directory by editing and deleting added users.

Registered users

The Email security directory contains registered users only. A registered user is a user added to the [impersonation registry](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/email-security/settings/detection-settings/impersonation-registry/).

To modify or delete users in the Email security directory:

1. In [Cloudflare One ↗](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/), go to **Email security** \> **Directories**.
2. Select **Email security Directory**.

## Add a user

To manually add a user to the Email security directory:

1. On the sidebar, go to **Settings** \> **Impersonation registry** \> **View**.
2. Select **Add a user**:
* Choose **Manual input** as the **Input method**.
* Under **User info**, enter the **Display name**.
* Under **User email**, enter the **Email addresses**.
1. Select **Save**.

To view users you manually added:

1. Go to **Directories**.
2. Select **Email security Directory**.
3. Any manually added user will be displayed under the table as **REGISTERED**.

## Edit a user

To edit a user in the Email security directory:

1. Select the user you want to edit.
2. Select the three dots > **Edit**.
3. Enter a user name and/or email.
4. Select **Save**.
