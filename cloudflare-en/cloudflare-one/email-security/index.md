Protect your email inbox with Email security.

Cloudflare Email Security uses AI, threat intelligence, and security rules to analyze every incoming email, protecting your organization from phishing, malware, [Business Email Compromise ↗](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/email-security/business-email-compromise-bec/) (where attackers impersonate executives or authority figures to commit fraud), vendor email fraud, and spam.

It integrates with your existing email provider (such as Outlook or Gmail) and can be deployed via [API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/email-security/setup/post-delivery-deployment/api/), [BCC](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/email-security/setup/post-delivery-deployment/bcc-journaling/bcc-setup/gmail-bcc-setup/gmail-bcc-setup/)/[Journaling](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/email-security/setup/post-delivery-deployment/bcc-journaling/journaling-setup/m365-journaling/), or [MX/Inline](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/email-security/setup/pre-delivery-deployment/mx-inline-deployment-setup/).

When you complete the [setup process](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/email-security/setup/), the Cloudflare dashboard will display the Email security overview page.

The Email security overview provides you with:

* **Quick actions**, where you can:  
  * View [submissions](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/email-security/submissions/)
  * Manage detection settings: manage [allow policies](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/email-security/settings/detection-settings/allow-policies/), [blocked senders](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/email-security/settings/detection-settings/blocked-senders/), [trusted domains](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/email-security/settings/detection-settings/trusted-domains/), [impersonation registry](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/email-security/settings/detection-settings/impersonation-registry/) and [additional detections](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/email-security/settings/detection-settings/additional-detections/).
  * [Run screens](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/email-security/investigation/search-email/#screen-criteria): Search, filter, reclassify, and bulk-move emails
* **Recommendations**: Suggested next steps to improve your configuration. For example, submitting misclassified emails for reclassification, creating policies, or protecting users at risk of [impersonation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/email-security/settings/detection-settings/impersonation-registry/).
* **Email security metrics**: Activity from the last seven days.
* **Recently modified policies**: A list of recently changed policies.
* **Education and resources**: Links to [implementation guides](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/implementation-guides/), [Email security changelogs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/changelog/email-security/), and [API documentation ↗](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/email%5Fsecurity/subresources/investigate/methods/get/)
