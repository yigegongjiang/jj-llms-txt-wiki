# User submissions

Last updated Apr 17, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/email-security/submissions/user-submissions/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

User submissions are the emails your users submitted for submission. User submissions help enhance our detection model, but can be escalated for human review.

Any email that is reported as [phish](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/email-security/settings/phish-submissions/#reclassify-an-email) will be displayed under **User submissions**.

Note

[PhishGuard](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/email-security/phishguard/) customers can have submissions analyzed when submitting at either user or team level. Any non-PhishGuard customer can still have submissions analyzed by submitting at team level.
