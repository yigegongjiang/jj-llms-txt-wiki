You can label an Access application with up to 25 custom tags. End users can then filter the applications in their [App Launcher](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/access-controls/access-settings/app-launcher/) by their tags.

### Create a tag

To create a new tag:

1. In the [Cloudflare dashboard ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/), go to **Zero Trust** \> **Reusable components** \> **Tags**.
2. Select **Add a tag**.
3. Enter up to 35 alphanumeric characters for the tag (for example, `Human Resources`) and select it in the dropdown menu.
4. Select **Save**.

You can now [add this tag](#tag-an-access-application) to an Access application.

### Tag an Access application

To add a tag to an existing Access application:

1. In the [Cloudflare dashboard ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/), go to **Zero Trust** \> **Access controls** \> **Applications**.
2. Select an application and select **Configure**.
3. Go to **Additional settings**.
4. In the **Tags** dropdown, select the tags that you would like to assign to this application. The tag must be [created](#create-a-tag) before you can select it in the dropdown.
5. Select **Save**.

The tag will now appear on the application's App Launcher tile.
