# Domain joined

Last updated May 1, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/reusable-components/posture-checks/client-checks/domain-joined/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

The Domain Joined device posture attribute ensures that a user is a member of a specific Windows Active Directory domain.

## Prerequisites

* Cloudflare One Client is [deployed](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/cloudflare-one-client/deployment/) on the device. For a list of supported modes and operating systems, refer to [Cloudflare One Client Checks](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/reusable-components/posture-checks/client-checks/).

## Enable the Domain Joined check

1. In the [Cloudflare dashboard ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/), go to **Zero Trust** \> **Reusable components** \> **Posture checks**.
2. Go to **Cloudflare One Client checks** and select **Add a check**.
3. Select **Domain Joined**.
4. Enter a descriptive name for the check.
5. Select your operating system.
6. Enter the domain you want to check for, such as `example.com`.  
Note  
The **Domain** field is case-sensitive. If your domain is `example.com`, entering `Example.com` will fail the posture check.
7. Select **Save**.

Next, go to **Insights** \> **Logs** \> **Posture logs** and verify that the Domain Joined check is returning the expected results.

## Validate the domain value

To check the domain value on your Windows device:

1. Open a PowerShell window.
2. Run the following command:  
```powershell  
(Get-WmiObject Win32_ComputerSystem).Domain  
```

The command will return the Active Directory domain to which your device belongs.
