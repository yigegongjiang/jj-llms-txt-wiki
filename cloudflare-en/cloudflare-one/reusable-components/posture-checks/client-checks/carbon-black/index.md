# Carbon Black

Last updated May 1, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/reusable-components/posture-checks/client-checks/carbon-black/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Cloudflare One can check if [Carbon Black ↗](https://www.carbonblack.com/) is running on a device to determine if a request should be allowed to reach a protected resource.

## Prerequisites

* Carbon Black agent is deployed on the device.
* Cloudflare One Client is [deployed](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/cloudflare-one-client/deployment/) on the device. For a list of supported modes and operating systems, refer to [Cloudflare One Client Checks](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/reusable-components/posture-checks/client-checks/).

## Configure the Carbon Black check

1. In the [Cloudflare dashboard ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/), go to **Zero Trust** \> **Reusable components** \> **Posture checks**.
2. Go to **Cloudflare One Client checks** and select **Add a check**.
3. Select **Carbon Black**.
4. You will be prompted for the following information:

  1. **Name**: Enter a unique name for this device posture check.
  2. **Operating system**: Select your operating system. You will need to configure one posture check per operating system (macOS and Windows currently supported).
  3. **Application Path**: Enter the full path to the Carbon Black process to be checked (for example, `c:\program files\CarbonBlack\CarbonBlack.exe`).
  4. **Signing certificate thumbprint (recommended)**: Enter the thumbprint of the publishing certificate used to sign the binary. This proves the binary came from Carbon Black and is the recommended way to validate the process.
  5. **SHA-256 (optional)**: Enter a SHA-256 value. This is used to validate the SHA256 signature of the binary and ensures the integrity of the binary file on the device. Note: do not fill out this field unless you strictly control updates to Carbon Black, as this will change between versions.

Next, go to **Insights** \> **Logs** \> **Posture logs** and verify that the Carbon Black check is returning the expected results.
