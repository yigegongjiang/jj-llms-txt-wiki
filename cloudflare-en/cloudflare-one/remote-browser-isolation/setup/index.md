# Set up Browser Isolation

Last updated Jul 7, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/remote-browser-isolation/setup/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Browser Isolation is enabled through [Secure Web Gateway HTTP policies](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/traffic-policies/http-policies/). By default, no traffic is isolated until you have added an Isolate policy to your HTTP policies.

## 1\. Connect devices to Cloudflare

Setup instructions vary depending on how you want to connect your devices to Cloudflare. Refer to the links below to view the setup guide for each deployment option.

| Connection                                                                                                                                                        | Mode         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

**In-line** mode means traffic is inspected as it flows through Gateway — users browse to websites using normal URLs, not a special Cloudflare prefix. Some in-line methods require device or network configuration, such as installing the Cloudflare One Client or configuring a PAC file. **Prefixed URL** mode requires users to visit a Cloudflare-hosted URL that wraps the target website.

## 2\. Build an Isolation policy

To configure Browser Isolation policies:

1. In [Cloudflare One ↗](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com), go to **Traffic policies** \> **Firewall policies** \> **HTTP**.
2. Select **Add a policy** and enter a name for the policy.
3. Use the HTTP policy [selectors](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/traffic-policies/http-policies/#selectors) and [operators](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/traffic-policies/http-policies/#comparison-operators) to specify the websites or content you want to isolate.
4. For **Action**, choose either [_Isolate_](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/remote-browser-isolation/isolation-policies/#isolate) or [_Do not Isolate_](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/remote-browser-isolation/isolation-policies/#do-not-isolate).
5. (Optional) Configure [settings](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/remote-browser-isolation/isolation-policies/#policy-settings) for an Isolate policy.
6. Select **Create policy**.

Next, [verify that your policy is working](#3-check-if-a-web-page-is-isolated).

## 3\. Check if a web page is isolated

Users can see if a webpage is isolated by using one of the following methods:

* Select the padlock in the address bar and check for the presence of a Cloudflare Root CA.
* Right-click the web page and view the context menu options.

### Normal browsing

* A non-Cloudflare root certificate indicates that Cloudflare did not proxy this web page. The root certificate is the certificate authority (CA) that your browser trusts to verify the site's identity.

* The right-click context menu will have all of the normal options.

### Isolated browsing

* A Cloudflare root certificate indicates traffic was proxied through Cloudflare Gateway.

* The right-click context menu will be simplified.

#### Disconnect Browser Isolation

Cloudflare One Client users can temporarily disable remote browsing by [disconnecting the Cloudflare One Client](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/cloudflare-one-client/configure/settings/#lock-device-client-switch). Once the Cloudflare One Client is disconnected, a refresh will return the non-isolated page.
