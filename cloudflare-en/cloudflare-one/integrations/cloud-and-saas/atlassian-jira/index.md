# Atlassian Jira

Last updated Apr 17, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/integrations/cloud-and-saas/atlassian-jira/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

The Atlassian Jira integration detects a variety of data loss prevention, account misconfiguration, and user security risks in an integrated Atlassian Jira Cloud account that could leave you and your organization vulnerable.

Note

At this time, the CASB integration for Jira is only compatible with Jira Cloud accounts. Support for Jira Data Center will come at a future date.

## Integration prerequisites

* A Jira Cloud plan (Free, Standard, Premium, Enterprise)
* Access to a Jira Cloud account with Site admin and/or Organization admin permissions

## Integration permissions

For the Jira Cloud integration to function, Cloudflare CASB requires the following permissions via an OAuth 2.0 app:

* `read:jira-work`
* `read:jira-user`

These permissions follow the principle of least privilege to ensure that only the minimum required access is granted. To learn more about each permission, refer to the [Atlassian scopes documentation ↗](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/scopes-for-oauth-2-3LO-and-forge-apps/).

## Security findings

The Jira Cloud integration currently scans for the following findings, or security risks. Findings are grouped by category and then ordered by [severity level](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/cloud-and-saas-findings/manage-findings/#severity-levels).

To stay up-to-date with new CASB findings as they are added, bookmark this page or subscribe to its [RSS feed](https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflare-docs/commits/production/src/content/docs/cloudflare-one/integrations/cloud-and-saas/atlassian-jira.mdx.atom).

### Access security
