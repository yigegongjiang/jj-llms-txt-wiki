# SharePoint

Last updated Apr 17, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/integrations/cloud-and-saas/microsoft-365/sharepoint/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

The SharePoint integration detects a variety of data loss prevention, account misconfiguration, and user security risks in an integrated Microsoft 365 account that could leave you and your organization vulnerable.

## Integration prerequisites

* A Microsoft 365 account with an active Microsoft Business Basic, Microsoft Business Standard, Microsoft 365 E3, Microsoft 365 E5, or Microsoft 365 F3 subscription
* [Global admin role ↗](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/about-admin-roles?view=o365-worldwide#commonly-used-microsoft-365-admin-center-roles) or equivalent permissions in Microsoft 365

## Integration permissions

Refer to [Microsoft 365 integration permissions](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/integrations/cloud-and-saas/microsoft-365/#integration-permissions) for information on which API permissions to enable.

## Security findings

The SharePoint integration currently scans for the following findings, or security risks. Findings are grouped by category and then ordered by [severity level](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/cloud-and-saas-findings/manage-findings/#severity-levels).

To stay up-to-date with new CASB findings as they are added, bookmark this page or subscribe to its [RSS feed](https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflare-docs/commits/production/src/content/docs/cloudflare-one/integrations/cloud-and-saas/microsoft-365/sharepoint.mdx.atom).

### File sharing

Get alerted when files in your Microsoft 365 account have their permissions changed to a less secure setting. Additionally, you can automatically remediate certain finding types directly from CASB. For more information, refer to [Remediate findings](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/cloud-and-saas-findings/manage-findings/#remediate-findings).

### Data Loss Prevention (optional)

These findings will only appear if you [added DLP profiles](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/cloud-and-saas-findings/casb-dlp/) to your CASB integration.

Additionally, you can automatically remediate certain finding types directly from CASB. For more information, refer to [Remediate findings](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/cloud-and-saas-findings/manage-findings/#remediate-findings).
