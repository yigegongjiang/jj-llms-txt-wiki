# Slack

Last updated Apr 17, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/integrations/cloud-and-saas/slack/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

The Slack integration detects a variety of data loss prevention, account misconfiguration, and user security risks in an integrated Slack Workspace that could leave you and your organization vulnerable.

## Integration prerequisites

* A Slack user account
* Membership in a Slack Workspace (Free, Pro, Business+, or Enterprise Grid)
* If you are not the Workspace Owner and the `Require App Approval` setting is enabled for the Workspace, [request permission ↗](https://slack.com/help/articles/202035138-Add-apps-to-your-Slack-workspace) to install apps.

## Integration permissions

For the Slack integration to function, Cloudflare CASB requires the following Slack API permissions:

* `channels:read`
* `files:read`
* `groups:read`
* `users:read`

These permissions follow the principle of least privilege to ensure that only the minimum required access is granted. To learn more about each permission, refer to the [Slack Permission scopes reference ↗](https://api.slack.com/scopes).

## Security findings

The Slack integration currently scans for the following findings, or security risks. Findings are grouped by category and then ordered by [severity level](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/cloud-and-saas-findings/manage-findings/#severity-levels).

To stay up-to-date with new CASB findings as they are added, bookmark this page or subscribe to its [RSS feed](https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflare-docs/commits/production/src/content/docs/cloudflare-one/integrations/cloud-and-saas/slack.mdx.atom).
