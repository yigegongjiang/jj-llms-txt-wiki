# Dropbox

Last updated Apr 17, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/integrations/cloud-and-saas/dropbox/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

The Dropbox integration detects a variety of data loss prevention, account misconfiguration, and user security risks in an integrated Dropbox account that could leave you and your organization vulnerable.

## Integration prerequisites

* A Dropbox Business plan (Standard, Advanced, Enterprise, or Education)
* Access to a Dropbox Business account with Team admin permissions

## Integration permissions

For the Dropbox integration to function, Cloudflare CASB requires the following Dropbox permissions via an OAuth 2.0 app:

* `account_info.read`
* `files.metadata.read`
* `files.content.read`
* `sharing.read`
* `team_info.read`
* `team_data.member`
* `team_data.governance.write`
* `team_data.governance.read`
* `files.team_metadata.read`
* `members.read`
* `groups.read`
* `sessions.list`

These permissions follow the principle of least privilege to ensure that only the minimum required access is granted. To learn more about each permission, refer to the [Dropbox API Permissions documentation ↗](https://developers.dropbox.com/oauth-guide#dropbox-api-permissions).

## Security findings

The Dropbox integration currently scans for the following findings, or security risks. Findings are grouped by category and then ordered by [severity level](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/cloud-and-saas-findings/manage-findings/#severity-levels).

To stay up-to-date with new CASB findings as they are added, bookmark this page or subscribe to its [RSS feed](https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflare-docs/commits/production/src/content/docs/cloudflare-one/integrations/cloud-and-saas/dropbox.mdx.atom).

### File and folder sharing
