# GitHub

Last updated Apr 17, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/integrations/cloud-and-saas/github/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

The GitHub integration detects a variety of data loss prevention, account misconfiguration, and user security risks in an integrated GitHub Organization that could leave you and your organization vulnerable.

## Integration prerequisites

* A GitHub account with a Free, Pro, or Enterprise plan
* Membership to a GitHub Organization with Owner or GitHub App manager permissions

## Integration permissions

For the GitHub integration to function, Cloudflare CASB requires the following GitHub API permissions:

| Permission                  | Access    | Description                                                                                             |
| --------------------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Administration              | Read-only | View basic administrative information from the account.                                                 |
| Members                     | Read-only | View metadata on organization members                                                                   |
| Metadata                    | Read-only | View metadata surrounding an organization's assets, excluding sensitive private repository information. |
| Organization administration | Read-only | View information on organization settings                                                               |

These permissions follow the principle of least privilege to ensure that only the minimum required access is granted. To learn more about each permission, refer to the [GitHub App permissions reference ↗](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/overview/permissions-required-for-github-apps).

## Security findings

The GitHub integration currently scans for the following findings, or security risks. Findings are grouped by category and then ordered by [severity level](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/cloud-and-saas-findings/manage-findings/#severity-levels).
