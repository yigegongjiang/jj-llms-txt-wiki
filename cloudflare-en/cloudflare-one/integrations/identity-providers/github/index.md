# GitHub

Last updated Apr 30, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/integrations/identity-providers/github/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Cloudflare One allows your team to connect to your applications using their GitHub login. You do not need to have a GitHub organization to use the integration.

## Set up GitHub Access

To configure GitHub access in both GitHub and Cloudflare One:

1. Log in to [GitHub ↗](https://github.com/).
2. Go to your account > **Settings** \> **Developer Settings**.
3. In **Developer Settings**, select **OAuth Apps** and select **New OAuth app**.
4. On the **Register a new OAuth application** page, enter an **Application name**. Your users will see this application name on the login page.
5. In the **Homepage URL** field, enter your team domain:  
```txt  
https://<your-team-name>.cloudflareaccess.com  
```  
You can find your team name in the [Cloudflare dashboard ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com) under **Settings** \> **Team name and domain** \> **Team name**.
6. In the GitHub **Authorization callback URL** field, enter the following URL:  
```txt  
https://<your-team-name>.cloudflareaccess.com/cdn-cgi/access/callback  
```
7. Select **Register application**.
8. Make note of the **Client ID**.
9. Select **Generate a new client secret** and copy the client secret to a safe place.
10. In the [Cloudflare dashboard ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/), go to **Zero Trust** \> **Integrations** \> **Identity providers**.
11. Select **Add new identity provider** and select **GitHub**.
12. In **App ID**, enter the **Client ID** obtained from GitHub (refer to step 8).
13. In **Client secret**, enter the **Client secret** obtained from GitHub (refer to step 9).
14. Select **Save**.
15. Select **Finish setup** to launch a GitHub authorization page. You will be asked to grant the following permissions to Cloudflare Access:

  * Organizations and teams (read-only)
  * Email addresses (read-only)
16. Select **Authorize**.

To test that your connection is working, go to the [Cloudflare dashboard ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) \> **Zero Trust** \> **Integrations** \> **Identity providers** and select **Test** next to your GitHub login method. If you have GitHub two-factor authentication enabled, you will need to first login to GitHub directly and return to Access.

Troubleshooting organization policies

When using a GitHub organization policy, if a user joins the required organization after a failed login attempt, they will remain blocked. To fix this, they must revoke the application's access in their GitHub settings and log in again to update their permissions.

## Example API Configuration

```json
{
	"config": {
		"client_id": "<your client id>",
		"client_secret": "<your client secret>"
	},
	"type": "github",
	"name": "my example idp"
}
```
