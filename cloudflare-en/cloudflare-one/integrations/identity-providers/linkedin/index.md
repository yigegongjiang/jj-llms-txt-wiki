Cloudflare Access allows your users to use LinkedIn as their identity provider (IdP).

## Prerequisites

Sign in to your LinkedIn account before continuing. Configuring LinkedIn as a Cloudflare Access IdP requires a LinkedIn account.

## Set up LinkedIn as an IdP

To configure LinkedIn as an IdP:

1. Go to the [LinkedIn Developer Portal ↗](https://www.linkedin.com/developers).
2. Select **Create App**.
3. On the **Create an app** page, enter an **App name** for your application.
4. Select a **LinkedIn Page** for your application or select **Create a new LinkedIn page** if you do not have a LinkedIn page.
5. Select **Upload a logo** and upload your company logo image file.
6. Select **API Terms of Use** to read the terms of use, and agree to the terms.
7. Select **Create app**.
8. In the **Products** tab of your LinkedIn application, select **Request Access** next to the **Sign In with LinkedIn using OpenID Connect** option.
9. In the **Auth** tab of your LinkedIn application, find the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.

10. In the [Cloudflare dashboard ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/), go to **Zero Trust** \> **Integrations** \> **Identity providers**.
11. Under **Your identity providers**, select **Add new identity provider**.
12. Select **LinkedIn** as your IdP.
13. In the **App ID** field, copy and paste the **Client ID** from step 9\. In the **Client secret** field, copy and paste the **Client secret** from step 9.
14. Select **Save**.
15. In the **Auth** tab of your LinkedIn application, go to **OAuth 2.0 settings** and select the pencil icon next to **Authorized redirect URLs for your app**.
16. Enter the following URL:  
```txt  
https://<your-team-name>.cloudflareaccess.com/cdn-cgi/access/callback  
```  
You can find your team name in the [Cloudflare dashboard ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com) under **Settings** \> **Team name and domain** \> **Team name**.

To test that your connection is working, go to the [Cloudflare dashboard ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) \> **Zero Trust** \> **Integrations** \> **Identity providers** and select **Test** next to your LinkedIn login method.
