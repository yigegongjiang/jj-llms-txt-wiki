# Authorization cookie

Last updated Aug 3, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/access-controls/applications/http-apps/authorization-cookie/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

When you protect a site with Cloudflare Access, Cloudflare checks every HTTP request bound for that site to ensure that the request has a valid `CF_Authorization` cookie. If a request does not include the cookie, Access will block the request.

## Access JWTs

The `CF_Authorization` cookie contains the user's identity in the form of a [JSON Web Token (JWT) ↗](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/token-based-authentication/). Cloudflare securely creates these tokens through the OAUTH or SAML integration between Cloudflare Access and the configured identity provider.

Access generates two separate `CF_Authorization` tokens depending on the domain:

* **Global session token**: Generated when a user logs in to Access. This token is stored as a cookie at your team domain (for example, `https://<your-team-name>.cloudflareaccess.com`) and prevents a user from needing to log in to each application.
* [**Application token**](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/access-controls/applications/http-apps/authorization-cookie/application-token/): Generated for each application that a user reaches. This token is stored as a cookie on the protected domain (for example, `https://jira.site.com`) and may be used to [validate requests](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/access-controls/applications/http-apps/authorization-cookie/validating-json) on your origin.

### Multi-domain applications

Cloudflare Access allows you to protect and manage multiple domains in a single [self-hosted application](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/access-controls/applications/http-apps/self-hosted-public-app/). After a user has successfully authenticated to one domain, Access will automatically issue a `CF_Authorization` cookie when they go to another domain in the same Access application. This means that users only need to authenticate once to a multi-domain application.

Access can preemptively set the cookie for every domain through a series of redirects when the user first authenticates. This allows single-page applications (SPAs) to retrieve data from other subdomains before the user visits each subdomain. Wildcarded subdomains (for example, `*.example.com`) cannot receive preemptive cookies because Access does not know which concrete subdomain to redirect to. Wildcarded paths are supported.

Use the [Eager redirect cookie](#eager-redirect-cookie) setting to control this behavior.

Note

Access previously chose the cookie behavior based on the number of domains. It preemptively set cookies for applications with five or fewer domains and issued cookies as users visited each domain for applications with more than five domains. Applications without a saved setting retain this behavior. Administrators can override it by turning the Eager redirect cookie setting on or off.

## Access cookies

The following Access cookies are essential to Access functionality. Cookies that are marked as required cannot be opted out of. The following cookies are not used for tracking or analytics.

## Cookie settings

Cloudflare Access provides optional security settings that can be added to the browser cookies generated by Access for an authenticated user.

* [SameSite](#samesite-attribute)
* [HttpOnly flag](#httponly)
* [Binding cookie](#binding-cookie)
* [Cookie path](#cookie-path-attribute)
* [Eager redirect cookie](#eager-redirect-cookie)

To enable these settings:

1. In the [Cloudflare dashboard ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/), go to **Zero Trust** \> **Access controls** \> **Applications**.
2. Locate the application you would like to configure and select **Configure**.
3. Select **Advanced settings** and scroll down to **Cookie settings**.
4. Configure the desired cookie settings.
5. Select **Save**.

### SameSite Attribute

The [SameSite ↗](https://web.dev/samesite-cookies-explained/) Attribute selector restricts the cookie to only being sent if the cookie's defined site matches the site being requested in the browser. This adds protection against [cross-site request forgery (CSRF) ↗](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site%5Frequest%5Fforgery).

The selector options are:

* **None** \- Cookies will be sent in all contexts, including cross-origin requests.
* **Lax** \- Cookies are allowed to be sent with top-level navigations and will be sent along with GET requests initiated by third party websites.
* **Strict** \- Cookies will only be sent in a first-party context and not be sent along with requests initiated by third party websites.

Refer to the [Mozilla documentation ↗](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Set-Cookie#samesitesamesite-value) for more information.

Caution

If you are receiving the `ERR_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS` errors, make sure your `SameSite` setting is set to None or Lax. Setting the `SameSite` setting to Strict can result in too many redirects.

#### When not to use SameSite

Do not enable `SameSite` restrictions if you have additional sites or applications that rely on a specific application's authorization cookie.

### HttpOnly

The `HttpOnly` flag is a cookie attribute that prevents the cookie from being accessed by any client-side scripts, reducing the likelihood of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This flag is enabled by default.

#### When not to use HttpOnly

Do not enable `HttpOnly` if:

* You are using the Access application for non-browser based tools (such as SSH or RDP).
* You have software that relies on being able to access a user's cookie generated by Access.

### Binding cookie

The binding cookie (`CF_Binding`) is an optional cookie issued when a user successfully authenticates. The binding cookie is sent by the user's browser and tied to a specific application's `CF_Authorization` cookie. This cookie is stripped at Cloudflare's network and never forwarded to the origin server.

The `CF_Authorization` cookie cannot be used without the associated binding cookie, which prevents a stolen `CF_Authorization` cookie from being reused by an attacker. If a request arrives at Cloudflare's network with a valid `CF_Authorization` cookie but without the expected binding cookie, Cloudflare rejects the request.

#### When not to use Binding Cookie

Do not enable Binding Cookie if:

* You are using the Access application for non-browser based tools (such as SSH or RDP).
* You have enabled [incompatible Cloudflare products](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/access-controls/applications/http-apps/self-hosted-public-app/#product-compatibility) on the application domain, such as [Zaraz](https://developers.cloudflare.com/zaraz) or [Google tag gateway](https://developers.cloudflare.com/google-tag-gateway/). Enabling Binding Cookie alongside these products can cause an authentication redirect loop (`ERR_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS`).
* You have turned on [Authenticate with Cloudflare One Client](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/cloudflare-one-client/configure/client-sessions/) for the application.

### Cookie Path Attribute

The Cookie Path Attribute adds the application's path URL to the `CF_Authorization` cookie. When enabled, a user who logs in to `example.com/path1` must re-authenticate to access `example.com/path2`. When disabled, the `CF_Authorization` cookie is only scoped to the domain and subdomain.

### Eager redirect cookie

When turned on, the Eager redirect cookie setting preemptively sets a `CF_Authorization` cookie for every concrete domain in a multi-domain application. Access redirects the browser through each domain after the user first authenticates. This setting is turned on by default for new applications.

Caution

Browser behavior can become unreliable when the redirect chain exceeds 10 redirects. If your application has more than 10 domains, turn off this setting or thoroughly test the authentication flow before you deploy it. When turned off, Access sets the cookie as a user visits each domain.

## Allow third-party cookies in the browser

By default, some browsers block all third-party cookies in private browsing mode, including the `CF_Authorization` cookie. For XHR requests to work in private windows, you will need to exempt your application and team domain from the browser's tracking protection system.

To enable third-party cookies for an Access application:

Chrome

1. Go to **Settings** \> **Privacy and security** \> **Cookies and other site data**.
2. Under **Sites that can always use cookies**, add the following URLs:  
  * Hostname of your Access application (for example, `https://jira.site.com`)
  * `https://<your-team-name>.cloudflareaccess.com`

Safari

1. Go to **Safari** \> **Settings** \> **Privacy**.
2. Deselect **Block all cookies**.

Firefox

1. Go to **Settings** \> **Privacy & Security**.
2. Scroll down to **Cookies and Site Data**.
3. Select **Manage Exceptions**.
4. Enter the URL of your Access application (for example, `https://jira.site.com`) and select **Allow**.
5. Enter `https://<your-team-name>.cloudflareaccess.com` and select **Allow**.
6. Select **Save Changes**.

Brave

1. Go to `brave://settings/cookies`.
2. Under **Sites that can always use cookies**, add the following URLs:  
  * Hostname of your Access application (for example, `https://jira.site.com`)
  * `https://<your-team-name>.cloudflareaccess.com`
