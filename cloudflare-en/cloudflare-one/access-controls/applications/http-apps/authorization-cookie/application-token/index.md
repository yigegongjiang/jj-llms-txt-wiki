# Application token

Last updated Jun 25, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/access-controls/applications/http-apps/authorization-cookie/application-token/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Cloudflare Access includes the application token with all authenticated requests to your origin. A typical JWT looks like this:

`eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6IjkzMzhhYmUxYmFmMmZlNDkyZjY0.eyJhdWQiOlsiOTdlMmFhZ TEyMDEyMWY5MDJkZjhiYzk5ZmMzNDU5MTNh.zLYsHmLEginAQUXdygQo08gLTExWNXsN4jBc6PKdB`

As shown above, the JWT contains three Base64-URL values separated by dots:

* [Header](#header)
* [Payload](#payload)
* [Signature](#signature)

Unless your application is connected to Access through Cloudflare Tunnel, your application must [validate the token](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/access-controls/applications/http-apps/authorization-cookie/validating-json/) to ensure the security of your origin. Validation of the header alone is not sufficient — the JWT and signature must be confirmed to avoid identity spoofing.

## Header

```json
{
	"alg": "RS256",
	"kid": "9338abe1baf2fe492f646a736f25afbf7b025e35c627be4f60c414d4c73069b8",
	"typ": "JWT"
}
```

* `alg` identifies the encoding algorithm.
* `kid` identifies the key used to sign the token.
* `typ` designates the token format.

## Payload

The payload contains the actual claim and user information to pass to the application. Payload contents vary depending on whether you authenticated to the application with an identity provider or with a [service token](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/access-controls/service-credentials/service-tokens/).

#### Custom SAML attributes and OIDC claims

Access allows you to add custom SAML attributes and OIDC claims to your JWT for enhanced verification, if supported by your identity provider. This is configured when you setup your [SAML](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/integrations/identity-providers/generic-saml/) or [OIDC](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/integrations/identity-providers/generic-oidc/) provider. Identity provider groups are only included in the token when you explicitly configure `groups` as a custom SAML attribute or OIDC claim. Access does not add them automatically.

Custom claims may be trimmed to fit cookie size limits

Custom SAML attributes and OIDC claims are included in the token's `custom` claim on a best-effort basis. To keep the token within browser cookie size limits, Access trims custom attributes and claims when the serialized `custom` claim exceeds roughly 1 KB (1,000 bytes), dropping configured values from the end of the list first. Groups are usually the largest contributor to this size, so a user who belongs to many groups can receive a token without their `groups` claim while other users on the same application keep it.

Do not rely on custom claims in the JWT for authorization decisions when they may grow large. To retrieve the user's full identity, including all groups, call the `/cdn-cgi/access/get-identity` endpoint described below.

#### User identity

User identity is useful for checking application permissions. For example, your application can validate that a given user is a member of an Okta or Microsoft Entra ID group such as `Finance-Team`.

Due to cookie size limits and bandwidth considerations, the application token only contains a subset of the user's identity. To get the user's full identity, send the `CF_Authorization` cookie to `https://<your-team-name>.cloudflareaccess.com/cdn-cgi/access/get-identity`. Your request should be structured as follows:

```sh
curl -H 'cookie: CF_Authorization=<user-token>' https://<your-team-name>.cloudflareaccess.com/cdn-cgi/access/get-identity
```

Access will return a JSON structure containing the following data:

## Signature

Cloudflare generates the signature by signing the encoded header and payload using the SHA-256 algorithm (RS256). In RS256, a private key signs the JWTs and a separate [public key](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/access-controls/applications/http-apps/authorization-cookie/validating-json/#access-signing-keys) verifies the signature.

For more information on JWTs, refer to [jwt.io ↗](https://jwt.io/).
