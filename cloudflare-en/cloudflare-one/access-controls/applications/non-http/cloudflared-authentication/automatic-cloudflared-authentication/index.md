# Enable automatic cloudflared authentication

Last updated May 6, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/access-controls/applications/non-http/cloudflared-authentication/automatic-cloudflared-authentication/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

When users connect to an Access application through `cloudflared`, the browser prompts them to allow access by displaying this page:

![Access request prompt page displayed after logging in with cloudflared.](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/image/onerror=redirect,width=1362,height=1016,format=webp/_astro/access-screen.BXZJ23p9.png) 

Automatic `cloudflared` authentication allows users to skip this login page if they already have an active IdP session.

To enable automatic `cloudflared` authentication:

1. In the [Cloudflare dashboard ↗](https://dash.cloudflare.com/), go to **Zero Trust** \> **Access controls** \> **Applications**.
2. Locate your application and select **Configure**.
3. Go to **Authentication**.
4. Turn on **Allow automatic Cloudflared authentication**.
5. Select **Save**.

This option will still prompt a browser window in the background, but authentication will now happen automatically.
