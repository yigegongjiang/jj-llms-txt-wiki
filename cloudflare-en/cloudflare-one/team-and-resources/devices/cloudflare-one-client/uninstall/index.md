# Uninstall the Cloudflare One Client

Last updated Aug 14, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/cloudflare-one-client/uninstall/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

The following procedures will uninstall the Cloudflare One Client (formerly WARP) from your device. If you used the Cloudflare One Client to deploy a root certificate, the certificate will also be removed.

## Windows

1. Go to Windows Settings (Windows Key + I).
2. Select **Apps**.
3. Select **Installed Apps**.
4. Scroll to find the Cloudflare One Client application, click the three dots (...), and select **Uninstall**.

## macOS

We include an uninstall script as part of the macOS package that you originally used.

1. To find and run the uninstall script, run the following commands:

```sh
cd /Applications/Cloudflare\ WARP.app/Contents/Resources
./uninstall.sh
```

1. If prompted, enter your admin credentials to proceed with the uninstall.

Note

You can bypass the **Are you sure** prompt by passing `-f` as a parameter to the macOS uninstall command.

## Linux

On CentOS 8, RHEL 8:

```sh
sudo yum remove cloudflare-warp
```

On Ubuntu 18.04, Ubuntu 20.04, Ubuntu 22.04, Debian 9, Debian 10, Debian 11:

```sh
sudo apt remove cloudflare-warp
```

## iOS and Android

1. Find the Cloudflare One Agent application (or the legacy 1.1.1.1 application) on the home screen.
2. Select and hold the application tile, and then select **Remove App**.
3. Select **Delete App**.

Note

If you [manually deployed a Cloudflare certificate](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/user-side-certificates/manual-deployment/), remember to manually delete the certificate from the device.
