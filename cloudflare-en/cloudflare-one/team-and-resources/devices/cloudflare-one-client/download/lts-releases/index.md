# Download Cloudflare One Client LTS releases

Last updated Apr 17, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/cloudflare-one-client/download/lts-releases/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Long-Term Support (LTS) releases are stable releases that are guaranteed to continue receiving security bug fixes for at least 12 months or 90 days after the next LTS release, whichever is greater.

For more details on Cloudflare One Client support timelines and end-of-life (EOL) policies, refer to the [Support lifecycle](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/cloudflare-one-client/download/support-lifecycle/) page.

Note

No LTS releases are currently available, as Cloudflare is still rolling out our new LTS release process. When a stable release is declared an LTS release, it will be listed on this page and announced in the [Cloudflare One Client changelog](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/changelog/cloudflare-one-client/).

1. On RHEL 9 and later, enable the [Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux (EPEL) ↗](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/epel/) repository (`sudo dnf install epel-release`) before installing `cloudflare-warp`. EPEL provides dependencies required by the client UI. [↩](#user-content-fnref-1)
