## macOS/Windows/Linux

### Collect logs via the CLI

To view client logs on desktop devices:

1. Open a Terminal window.
2. Run the `warp-diag` tool:  
```sh  
warp-diag  
```

This will place a `warp-debugging-info-<date>-<time>.zip` on your desktop.

1. Open a Command Prompt or PowerShell window.
2. Run the `warp-diag` tool:  
```bash  
C:\Users\JohnDoe>warp-diag  
```

This will place a `warp-debugging-info-<date>-<time>.zip` on your desktop.

1. Open a Terminal window.
2. Run the `warp-diag` tool:  
```sh  
warp-diag  
```

This will place a `warp-debugging-info-<date>-<time>.zip` in the same folder you ran the command from.

### Collect logs via the dashboard

You can collect client diagnostic logs remotely from the Zero Trust dashboard by using Digital Experience Monitoring (DEX) [remote captures](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/insights/dex/diagnostics/client-packet-capture/).

Devices must be actively connected to the Internet for remote captures to run.

To capture data from a remote device:

1. In [Cloudflare One ↗](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/), go to **DEX** \> **Remote captures**.
2. Select up to 10 devices that you want to run a capture on. Devices must be [registered](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/cloudflare-one-client/deployment/) in your Zero Trust organization.
3. Configure the types of captures to run.  
  * **Packet captures (PCAP)**: Performs packet captures for traffic outside of the WARP tunnel (default network interface) and traffic inside of the WARP tunnel ([virtual interface](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/cloudflare-one-client/configure/route-traffic/client-architecture/#ip-traffic)).
  * **Device diagnostic logs**: Generates a [Cloudflare One Client diagnostic log](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/cloudflare-one-client/troubleshooting/diagnostic-logs/#warp-diag-logs) of the past 96 hours. To include a routing test for all IPs and domains in your [Split Tunnel configuration](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/cloudflare-one-client/configure/route-traffic/split-tunnels/), select **Test all routes**.  
  Note

**Test all routes** will extend the time for diagnostics to run and may temporarily impact device performance during the test.
4. Select **Run diagnostics**.

DEX will now send capture requests to the configured devices. If the Cloudflare One Client is disconnected, the capture will time out after 10 minutes.

#### Download remote captures

1. In [Cloudflare One ↗](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/), go to **DEX** \> **Remote captures**.
2. Find a successful capture.
3. Select the three-dot menu and select **Download**.

This will download a ZIP file to your local machine called `<capture-id>.zip`. DEX will store capture data according to our [log retention policy](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/insights/logs/#log-retention).

#### Diagnostics analyzer (beta)

The diagnostics analyzer highlights what Cloudflare determines to be the most important detection events in a `warp-diag` log. You can use the detection report to help parse your [log files](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/cloudflare-one-client/troubleshooting/diagnostic-logs/#warp-diag-logs) and identify the root cause of client issues. The diagnostics analyzer is only available for logs [collected via the dashboard](#collect-logs-via-the-dashboard).

To access the diagnostics analyzer:

1. In [Cloudflare One ↗](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/), go to **DEX** \> **Remote captures**.
2. Locate an existing `warp-diag` log from the list or select **Run diagnostics** to generate a new `warp-diag` log.
3. Select the three dots for the `warp-diag` log that you want to analyze, then select **View Device Diag**.  
The **Overview** tab will display an [AI-generated summary](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/reference/cloudy-ai-agent/) of the results, a list of detection events, and basic device information.

#### Multiple versions of the same log

The `warp-debugging-info` folder may contain multiple versions of the same log, such as `daemon.log`, `daemon.1.log`, and `daemon.2.log`. Since logs can get very long, they are rotated either daily or when they exceed a certain size.

* `<logfile>.log` is the most current log. This is almost always the log you should be looking at, as it shows events that occurred on the day you ran the `warp-diag` command.
* `<logfile>.1.log` shows events from the previous day.
* `<logfile>.2.log` shows events from two days before.

Note

In timestamped logs such as `daemon.log`, the most recent events will appear at the end of the file.

### Extra debug logging

Starting with version 2026.5.0, you can enable extra debug logging with the command `warp-cli debug extra start`. Extra debug logging times out after 10 minutes unless you manually stop it with `warp-cli debug extra stop`.

This enables a few more logging features:

* Packet captures (PCAPs) on all interfaces (on Windows, the original `.etl` file is preserved; other PCAP commands convert it to `.pcap` before removing it)
* QLog files for MASQUE tunnel connections
* DNS logs for [service modes with DNS filtering](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/cloudflare-one-client/configure/modes/)
* One-shot connectivity checks (same information as `connectivity.txt`, collected when extra debug logging starts rather than when `warp-diag` runs)
* One-shot traceroutes to:  
  * DNS resolver IPs
  * DNS resolver hostname
  * Device API endpoint IPs
  * Device API endpoint hostname
  * Tunnel edge connection IPs
* On Windows, if you are an administrator:  
  * [netsh trace ↗](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/netsh-trace) with the `Microsoft-Windows-TCPIP` provider
  * [WFP capture ↗](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/netsh-wfp)

If extra debug logging is enabled, the command `warp-cli debug extra reconnect` forces the tunnel connection to restart. This can be useful for collecting log information if the tunnel connection fails.

Extra debug logging space requirements

On Windows, log data created by extra debug logging may consume 600 MB of space or more over 10 minutes of collection. The `netsh` TCPIP trace file contains the majority of this data (500 MB), and compresses well into the diagnostic archive.

Extra debug logging on other platforms generates significantly less data.

### Log retention window

Each client log file (such as `connection_stats.log`, `dns_stats.log`, `daemon.log`, `boringtun.log`, `daemon_dns.log`, `dex.log` and `captive-portal.log`) is limited by size and age:

* **Maximum file size:** 10 MB
* **Maximum file age:** 24 hours
* **Maximum number of retained versions per log:** 4 (for example, `daemon.log`, `daemon.1.log`, `daemon.2.log`, and `daemon.3.log`)

Log files may include data from up to 96 hours (four days) prior to when `warp-diag` was run, but only if log activity is minimal. In environments with high logging volume (for example, repeated errors), logs may rotate more frequently, and the captured window could be much shorter (only a few hours).

Always check the timestamps at the end of each log file to verify the time range covered by the diagnostic archive.

Linux log behavior

On Linux, the WARP daemon logs are written to the system logs by the `warp-svc` service.

If you need to adjust the maximum log level or filter what gets logged, you can configure the WARP `systemd` unit file using the [LogLevelMax= option ↗](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/systemd.exec.html#LogLevelMax=).

The Cloudflare One Client does not provide an official method to configure logging levels during the installation process.
