## Windows

1. Create a script file with `.bat`, `.cmd`, and `.ps1` file formats to download, install and configure the Cloudflare One Client (formerly WARP) Windows application on the device. Listed below is a sample script with all of the configurable parameters:  
```python  
<# Choose file name for downloading application #>  
$filename = filename.msi'  
<# Download URL of the installer. #>  
$url = 'https://downloads.cloudflareclient.com/v1/download/windows/ga'  
Write-Host 'Downloading App from' $url  
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $url -OutFile $filename  
<# Run the installer and wait for the installation to finish #>  
$arguments = "ORGANIZATION="exampleorg" SERVICE_MODE="warp" GATEWAY_UNIQUE_ID="fmxk762nrj" SUPPORT_URL="http://support.example.com""  
$installProcess = (Start-Process $filename -ArgumentList $arguments -PassThru -Wait)  
<# Check if installation was successful #>  
if ($installProcess.ExitCode -ne 0) {  
    Write-Host "Installation failed!"  
    exit $installProcess.ExitCode  
}  
else {  
    Write-Host "Installation completed successfully!"  
}  
```
2. Push the script file to the devices using Hexnode.
3. On your Hexnode console, go to **Manage** \> **Devices**.
4. Select your device name. This will take you to the **Device Summary**.
5. Select **Actions** \> **Execute Custom Script**.
6. Choose the script file source as _Upload file_, then upload the script file.
7. Select **Execute**.

After deploying the Cloudflare One Client, you can check its connection progress using the [Connectivity status](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/cloudflare-one-client/troubleshooting/connectivity-status/) messages displayed in the Cloudflare One Client GUI.

2. On your Hexnode console, go to **Apps** \> **Add Apps** \> **Enterprise App**.
3. Select _macOS_ as the app platform.
4. Add an app name, category and description.
5. Upload the `Cloudflare_WARP_<VERSION>.pkg` file and select **Add**.
6. Set up an XML file with the supported app configurations for the app. Here is a sample XML file with the accepted parameters.  
```xml  
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>  
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
