Last updated Apr 17, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/cloudflare-one-client/deployment/mdm-deployment/partners/fleet/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

This guide covers how to deploy the Cloudflare One Client (formerly WARP) using [Fleet ↗](https://fleetdm.com/) device management software.

## macOS

### 1\. Create a custom MDM file

1. [Download](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/static/mdm/CloudflareWARP.mobileconfig) an example `.mobileconfig` file.
2. Modify the file with your desired [deployment parameters](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/cloudflare-one-client/deployment/mdm-deployment/parameters/).

### 2\. Upload MDM file to Fleet

1. In the Fleet admin console, go to **Controls**.
2. From the **Teams** dropdown, select the team (group of hosts) that requires the Cloudflare One Client.
3. Select **OS settings** \> **Custom settings**.
4. Select **Add profile** and upload the custom `.mobileconfig`.
5. Select the hosts which require the Cloudflare One Client:  
  * **All hosts**: Deploys the Cloudflare One Client to all hosts in the team.
  * **Custom**: Deploys the Cloudflare One Client to a subset of the hosts in the team. Use [labels ↗](https://fleetdm.com/guides/managing-labels-in-fleet#basic-article) to define the hosts that should be included or excluded.
6. Select **Add profile**.

The defined hosts will immediately receive the deployment profile, but the Cloudflare One Client is not yet installed.

### 3\. Download Cloudflare One Client package for macOS

Visit the [Download page](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/cloudflare-one-client/download/#macos) to review system requirements and download the installer for your operating system.

### 4\. Upload Cloudflare One Client package to Fleet

To add the Cloudflare One Client installer package for distribution to your hosts enrolled in Fleet:

1. In the Fleet admin console, go to **Software**.
2. From the **Teams** dropdown, select the team (group of hosts) that requires the Cloudflare One Client.
3. Select **Add Software** and upload the `.pkg` file that was previously downloaded.

### 5\. Install the Cloudflare One Client with Fleet

To deploy the uploaded `.pkg` file to your hosts:

1. In the Fleet admin console, go to **Hosts**.
2. Select the host that requires the Cloudflare One Client.
3. Go to **Software** and search for `Cloudflare`.
4. Select **Actions** \> **Install**.

Installation will happen automatically when the host comes online. To deploy with REST API or GitOps, refer to the [Fleet documentation ↗](https://fleetdm.com/guides/deploy-software-packages). 

After deploying the Cloudflare One Client, you can check its connection progress using the [Connectivity status](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/cloudflare-one-client/troubleshooting/connectivity-status/) messages displayed in the Cloudflare One Client GUI.

### 6\. Uninstall the Cloudflare One Client with Fleet

To uninstall the Fleet-deployed Cloudflare One Client:

1. In the Fleet admin console, go to **Hosts**.
2. Select the host that requires the Cloudflare One Client to be uninstalled.
3. Go to **Software** and search for `Cloudflare`.
4. Select **Actions** \> **Uninstall**.

## Windows

### 1\. Download Cloudflare One Client package for Windows

Visit the [Download page](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/cloudflare-one-client/download/#windows) to review system requirements and download the installer for your operating system.

### 2\. Upload Cloudflare One Client package to Fleet

To add the Cloudflare One Client installer package for distribution to your hosts enrolled in Fleet:

1. In the Fleet admin console, go to **Software**.
2. From the **Teams** dropdown, select the team (group of hosts) that requires the Cloudflare One Client.
3. Select **Add Software** and upload the `.msi` file that was previously downloaded.
4. (Optional) To allow users to install the Cloudflare One Client from Fleet Desktop, select **Self-service**.
5. Select **Advanced options**.
6. In **Install script**, replace the default script with the following:

```bash
$logFile = "${env:TEMP}/fleet-install-software.log"

try {

$installProcess = Start-Process msiexec.exe `
  -ArgumentList "/quiet /norestart ORGANIZATION=your-team-name SUPPORT_URL=https://example.com /lv ${logFile} /i `"${env:INSTALLER_PATH}`"" `
  -PassThru -Verb RunAs -Wait

Get-Content $logFile -Tail 500

Exit $installProcess.ExitCode

} catch {
  Write-Host "Error: $_"
  Exit 1
}
```

Refer to [deployment parameters](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/cloudflare-one-client/deployment/mdm-deployment/parameters/) for a description of each argument.

## Linux

Fleet allows you to [execute custom scripts ↗](https://fleetdm.com/guides/scripts) on Linux hosts. The following example script creates an [MDM file](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/cloudflare-one-client/deployment/mdm-deployment/#linux) and installs the Cloudflare One Client on an Ubuntu 22.04 host:

```sh
#!/bin/sh

# Write the mdm.xml file
touch /var/lib/cloudflare-warp/mdm.xml
echo -e "<dict>\n   <key>organization</key>\n   <string>your-team-name</string>\n</dict>
" > /var/lib/cloudflare-warp/mdm.xml

# Add cloudflare gpg key
curl -fsSL https://pkg.cloudflareclient.com/pubkey.gpg | sudo gpg --yes --dearmor --output /usr/share/keyrings/cloudflare-warp-archive-keyring.gpg

# Add this repo to your apt repositories
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/cloudflare-warp-archive-keyring.gpg] https://pkg.cloudflareclient.com/ any main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/cloudflare-client.list

# Install
sudo apt-get -y update && sudo apt-get -y install cloudflare-warp
```

To install the Cloudflare One Client on other Linux distributions, refer to the [package repository ↗](https://pkg.cloudflareclient.com/).
