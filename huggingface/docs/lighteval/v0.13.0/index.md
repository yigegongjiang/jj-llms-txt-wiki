# Lighteval

🤗 Lighteval is your all-in-one toolkit for evaluating Large Language Models
(LLMs) across multiple backends with ease. Dive deep into your model's
performance by saving and exploring detailed, sample-by-sample results to debug
and see how your models stack up.

## Key Features

### 🚀 **Multi-Backend Support**
Evaluate your models using the most popular and efficient inference backends:
- `eval`: Use [inspect-ai](https://inspect.aisi.org.uk/) as backend to evaluate and inspect your models ! (prefered way)
- `transformers`: Evaluate models on CPU or one or more GPUs using [🤗
  Accelerate](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers)
- `nanotron`: Evaluate models in distributed settings using [⚡️
  Nanotron](https://github.com/huggingface/nanotron)
- `vllm`: Evaluate models on one or more GPUs using [🚀
  VLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm)
- `custom`: Evaluate custom models (can be anything)
- `sglang`: Evaluate models using [SGLang](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang) as backend
- `inference-endpoint`: Evaluate models using Hugging Face's [Inference Endpoints API](https://huggingface.co/inference-endpoints/dedicated)
- `tgi`: Evaluate models using [🔗 Text Generation Inference](https://huggingface.co/docs/text-generation-inference/en/index) running locally
- `litellm`: Evaluate models on any compatible API using [LiteLLM](https://www.litellm.ai/)
- `inference-providers`: Evaluate models using [HuggingFace's inference providers](https://huggingface.co/docs/inference-providers/en/index) as backend**: Distributed training and evaluation

### 📊 **Comprehensive Evaluation**
- **Extensive Task Library**: 1000s pre-built evaluation tasks
- **Custom Task Creation**: Build your own evaluation tasks
- **Flexible Metrics**: Support for custom metrics and scoring
- **Detailed Analysis**: Sample-by-sample results for deep insights

### 🔧 **Easy Customization**
Customization at your fingertips: create [new tasks](adding-a-custom-task),
[metrics](adding-a-new-metric) or [model](evaluating-a-custom-model) tailored to your needs, or browse all our existing tasks and metrics.

### ☁️ **Seamless Integration**
Seamlessly experiment, benchmark, and store your results on the Hugging Face Hub, S3, or locally.

## Quick Start
