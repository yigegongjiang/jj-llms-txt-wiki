# ThinkingBox

## Introduction

[ThinkingBox](https://github.com/microsoft/thinkingbox) is an agentic harness for
defining isolated MCP tool environments, creating stateful scenarios and test
cases, running an LLM agent with simulated-user interaction, and evaluating
the resulting backend state, side effects, and response requirements. It can
support offline evaluation or conversation generation and agentic training
workflows.

This OpenEnv adapter exposes the public
[ThinkingBox-Bench](https://arxiv.org/abs/2608.19741) through the standard
WebSocket reset/step interface. The adapter is currently designed for
evaluation only. Canonical coverage uses the pinned public benchmark release;
user-supplied ThinkingBox scenarios can also be evaluated when their executable
data and external services are provided, but those runs are not canonical
ThinkingBox-Bench results.

## Quick Start

Start the externally managed ThinkingBox services described under
[Deployment Boundary](#deployment-boundary), then run the OpenEnv server:

```bash
OPENENV_TB_CONFIG=/path/to/thinkingbox.yaml \
uv run --project envs/thinkingbox_env --frozen server
```

Connect from a trusted harness:

```python
from thinkingbox_env import ThinkingBoxEnv

async with ThinkingBoxEnv(base_url="http://127.0.0.1:8000") as env:
    result = await env.reset("file.py:test_name")
    tools = await env.list_tools()
    result = await env.call_tool("tool_name", {"argument": "value"})
    result = await env.submit_message("Final response")
```

## Examples

- [Public client example](https://github.com/huggingface/OpenEnv/blob/main/examples/thinkingbox/example_usage.py):
  reset a server-visible task and inspect its public task and tool observations
  without loading benchmark implementation data on the client.
- [Evaluation wrapper](https://github.com/huggingface/OpenEnv/blob/main/examples/thinkingbox/eval_testlist.py):
  invoke the packaged `thinkingbox-eval` CLI for native model orchestration,
  repetition IDs, privacy-reviewed canonical JSONL, and strict aggregation.

Run either script from the repository root:

```bash
uv run --project envs/thinkingbox_env \
  python examples/thinkingbox/example_usage.py file.py:test_name

uv run --project envs/thinkingbox_env \
  python examples/thinkingbox/eval_testlist.py \
  --config /path/to/thinkingbox.yaml \
  --output results.jsonl
```

The evaluator's `--config` and `--dataset` paths are local to the trusted
evaluator. For a remote OpenEnv server, pass the corresponding server-visible
paths with `--env-config` and `--env-dataset`. Strict `canary` and `full`
coverage profiles accept only the pinned public benchmark; custom scenario
bundles use ordinary non-profiled evaluation.

## Environment Details

The adapter preserves native ThinkingBox hydration, history replay, tool
overrides, parallel tool batches, direct responses, simulated users, effects,
fixtures, `TestContext`, `TestScript`, `Judge`, error latching, and teardown.
Final rewards are binary pass/fail; infrastructure failures are reported
separately and never converted into benchmark failures.

The model-facing action surface contains tool discovery, tool calls, and
assistant messages. A trusted harness may call `finish()`, but finish is not
advertised in the public action schema. Private user context, initialization
state, assertion source, credentials, proxy session identifiers, effects, and
grading internals remain inside the environment.

`seed` is accepted for OpenEnv API compatibility but intentionally unused
because tasks are selected deterministically by UID. Concurrent sessions are
stacked independent environment instances, one trajectory per instance; they
are not multiplexed trajectories.

Executable assets come from the pinned `thinkingbox-bench-v1.0` release in
[`microsoft/thinkingbox-data`](https://github.com/microsoft/thinkingbox-data).
The [Hugging Face `microsoft/ThinkingBox-Bench`
dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/microsoft/ThinkingBox-Bench) is a
viewer-friendly representation, while GitHub remains the executable source.

## Configuration

The server accepts an ordinary native ThinkingBox YAML configuration through
`OPENENV_TB_CONFIG` or the reset `config=` argument. The file supplies
`mcp_proxy`, `orchestrator.agent_model`, `user_model`, `judge_model`,
`judge_type`, and user-completion behavior; see the
[ThinkingBox LLM configuration
guide](https://github.com/microsoft/thinkingbox/blob/main/docs/llm_endpoint_config.md).

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `OPENENV_TB_PROXY_URL` | `http://127.0.0.1:7111` | Session Proxy fallback |
| `OPENENV_TB_DATASET` | pinned release | Local executable-data override |
| `OPENENV_TB_DATA_CACHE` | `~/.cache/openenv/thinkingbox_bench` | Verified release cache |
| `OPENENV_TB_AGENT` | `think` | Native agent definition |
| `OPENENV_TB_CONFIG` | unset | Native server-side model/proxy config |
| `OPENENV_TB_PROXY_TIMEOUT` | `120` | Proxy timeout without config override |
| `OPENENV_TB_DATA_TIMEOUT` | `120` | Release download timeout |
| `OPENENV_TB_MAX_CONCURRENT_ENVS` | `8` | Independent environment instances |

The client message timeout remains longer than server-side model and episode
operations so a valid long-running turn is not abandoned prematurely.

## Deployment Boundary

The image starts only the OpenEnv API. It currently needs an externally
managed ThinkingBox Session Proxy, benchmark MCP servers, Typesense, and agent,
user-simulator, and judge model endpoints. `GET /health` reports process
liveness; `GET /ready` reports the observable external dependencies and marks
scenario-specific Typesense readiness as unobservable from this process.
