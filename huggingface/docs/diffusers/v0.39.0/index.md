# Diffusers

Diffusers is a library of state-of-the-art pretrained diffusion models for generating videos, images, and audio.

The library revolves around the [DiffusionPipeline](/docs/diffusers/v0.39.0/en/api/pipelines/overview#diffusers.DiffusionPipeline), an API designed for:

- easy inference with only a few lines of code
- flexibility to mix-and-match pipeline components (models, schedulers)
- loading and using adapters like LoRA

Diffusers also comes with optimizations - such as offloading and quantization - to ensure even the largest models are accessible on memory-constrained devices. If memory is not an issue, Diffusers supports torch.compile to boost inference speed.

## Learn

If you're a beginner, we recommend starting with the [Hugging Face Diffusion Models Course](https://huggingface.co/learn/diffusion-course/unit0/1). You'll learn the theory behind diffusion models, and learn how to use the Diffusers library to generate images, fine-tune your own models, and more.
