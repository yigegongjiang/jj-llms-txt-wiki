[Wan-2.1](https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.20314) by the Wan Team.

*This report presents Wan, a comprehensive and open suite of video foundation models designed to push the boundaries of video generation. Built upon the mainstream diffusion transformer paradigm, Wan achieves significant advancements in generative capabilities through a series of innovations, including our novel VAE, scalable pre-training strategies, large-scale data curation, and automated evaluation metrics. These contributions collectively enhance the model's performance and versatility. Specifically, Wan is characterized by four key features: Leading Performance: The 14B model of Wan, trained on a vast dataset comprising billions of images and videos, demonstrates the scaling laws of video generation with respect to both data and model size. It consistently outperforms the existing open-source models as well as state-of-the-art commercial solutions across multiple internal and external benchmarks, demonstrating a clear and significant performance superiority. Comprehensiveness: Wan offers two capable models, i.e., 1.3B and 14B parameters, for efficiency and effectiveness respectively. It also covers multiple downstream applications, including image-to-video, instruction-guided video editing, and personal video generation, encompassing up to eight tasks. Consumer-Grade Efficiency: The 1.3B model demonstrates exceptional resource efficiency, requiring only 8.19 GB VRAM, making it compatible with a wide range of consumer-grade GPUs. Openness: We open-source the entire series of Wan, including source code and all models, with the goal of fostering the growth of the video generation community. This openness seeks to significantly expand the creative possibilities of video production in the industry and provide academia with high-quality video foundation models. All the code and models are available at [this https URL](https://github.com/Wan-Video/Wan2.1).*

### Text-to-Video Generation

The example below demonstrates how to generate a video from text optimized for memory or inference speed.

Refer to the [Reduce memory usage](../../optimization/memory) guide for more details about the various memory saving techniques.

The Wan2.1 text-to-video model below requires ~13GB of VRAM.

[Compilation](../../optimization/fp16#torchcompile) is slow the first time but subsequent calls to the pipeline are faster. [Caching](../../optimization/cache) may also speed up inference by storing and reusing intermediate outputs.

### First-Last-Frame-to-Video Generation

The example below demonstrates how to use the image-to-video pipeline to generate a video using a text description, a starting frame, and an ending frame.

```python
import numpy as np
import torch
import torchvision.transforms.functional as TF
from diffusers import AutoencoderKLWan, WanImageToVideoPipeline
from diffusers.utils import export_to_video, load_image
from transformers import CLIPVisionModel

model_id = "Wan-AI/Wan2.1-FLF2V-14B-720P-diffusers"
image_encoder = CLIPVisionModel.from_pretrained(model_id, subfolder="image_encoder", dtype=torch.float32)
vae = AutoencoderKLWan.from_pretrained(model_id, subfolder="vae", dtype=torch.float32)
pipe = WanImageToVideoPipeline.from_pretrained(
    model_id, vae=vae, image_encoder=image_encoder, dtype=torch.bfloat16
)
pipe.to("cuda")

first_frame = load_image("https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/diffusers/flf2v_input_first_frame.png")
last_frame = load_image("https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/diffusers/flf2v_input_last_frame.png")

def aspect_ratio_resize(image, pipe, max_area=720 * 1280):
    aspect_ratio = image.height / image.width
    mod_value = pipe.vae_scale_factor_spatial * pipe.transformer.config.patch_size[1]
    height = round(np.sqrt(max_area * aspect_ratio)) // mod_value * mod_value
    width = round(np.sqrt(max_area / aspect_ratio)) // mod_value * mod_value
    image = image.resize((width, height))
    return image, height, width

def center_crop_resize(image, height, width):
    # Calculate resize ratio to match first frame dimensions
    resize_ratio = max(width / image.width, height / image.height)

    # Resize the image
    width = round(image.width * resize_ratio)
    height = round(image.height * resize_ratio)
    size = [width, height]
    image = TF.center_crop(image, size)

    return image, height, width

first_frame, height, width = aspect_ratio_resize(first_frame, pipe)
if last_frame.size != first_frame.size:
    last_frame, _, _ = center_crop_resize(last_frame, height, width)

prompt = "CG animation style, a small blue bird takes off from the ground, flapping its wings. The bird's feathers are delicate, with a unique pattern on its chest. The background shows a blue sky with white clouds under bright sunshine. The camera follows the bird upward, capturing its flight and the vastness of the sky from a close-up, low-angle perspective."

output = pipe(
    image=first_frame, last_image=last_frame, prompt=prompt, height=height, width=width, guidance_scale=5.5
).frames[0]
export_to_video(output, "output.mp4", fps=16)
```

### Any-to-Video Controllable Generation

Wan VACE supports various generation techniques which achieve controllable video generation. Some of the capabilities include:
- Control to Video (Depth, Pose, Sketch, Flow, Grayscale, Scribble, Layout, Boundary Box, etc.). Recommended library for preprocessing videos to obtain control videos: [huggingface/controlnet_aux]()
- Image/Video to Video (first frame, last frame, starting clip, ending clip, random clips)
- Inpainting and Outpainting
- Subject to Video (faces, object, characters, etc.)
- Composition to Video (reference anything, animate anything, swap anything, expand anything, move anything, etc.)

The code snippets available in [this](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/pull/11582) pull request demonstrate some examples of how videos can be generated with controllability signals.

The general rule of thumb to keep in mind when preparing inputs for the VACE pipeline is that the input images, or frames of a video that you want to use for conditioning, should have a corresponding mask that is black in color. The black mask signifies that the model will not generate new content for that area, and only use those parts for conditioning the generation process. For parts/frames that should be generated by the model, the mask should be white in color.

### Wan-Animate: Unified Character Animation and Replacement with Holistic Replication

[Wan-Animate](https://huggingface.co/papers/2509.14055) by the Wan Team.

*We introduce Wan-Animate, a unified framework for character animation and replacement. Given a character image and a reference video, Wan-Animate can animate the character by precisely replicating the expressions and movements of the character in the video to generate high-fidelity character videos. Alternatively, it can integrate the animated character into the reference video to replace the original character, replicating the scene's lighting and color tone to achieve seamless environmental integration. Wan-Animate is built upon the Wan model. To adapt it for character animation tasks, we employ a modified input paradigm to differentiate between reference conditions and regions for generation. This design unifies multiple tasks into a common symbolic representation. We use spatially-aligned skeleton signals to replicate body motion and implicit facial features extracted from source images to reenact expressions, enabling the generation of character videos with high controllability and expressiveness. Furthermore, to enhance environmental integration during character replacement, we develop an auxiliary Relighting LoRA. This module preserves the character's appearance consistency while applying the appropriate environmental lighting and color tone. Experimental results demonstrate that Wan-Animate achieves state-of-the-art performance. We are committed to open-sourcing the model weights and its source code.*

The project page: https://humanaigc.github.io/wan-animate

This model was mostly contributed by [M. Tolga Cangöz](https://github.com/tolgacangoz).

#### Usage

The Wan-Animate pipeline supports two modes of operation:

1. **Animation Mode** (default): Animates a character image based on motion and expression from reference videos
2. **Replacement Mode**: Replaces a character in a background video with a new character while preserving the scene

##### Prerequisites

Before using the pipeline, you need to preprocess your reference video to extract:
- **Pose video**: Contains skeletal keypoints representing body motion
- **Face video**: Contains facial feature representations for expression control

For replacement mode, you additionally need:
- **Background video**: The original video containing the scene
- **Mask video**: A mask indicating where to generate content (white) vs. preserve original (black)

> [!NOTE]
> Raw videos should not be used for inputs such as `pose_video`, which the pipeline expects to be preprocessed to extract the proper information. Preprocessing scripts to prepare these inputs are available in the [original Wan-Animate repository](https://github.com/Wan-Video/Wan2.2?tab=readme-ov-file#1-preprocessing). Integration of these preprocessing steps into Diffusers is planned for a future release.

The example below demonstrates how to use the Wan-Animate pipeline:

```python
import numpy as np

from diffusers import AutoencoderKLWan, WanAnimatePipeline
from diffusers.utils import export_to_video, load_image, load_video

#### Key Parameters

- **mode**: Choose between `"animate"` (default) or `"replace"`
- **prev_segment_conditioning_frames**: Number of frames for temporal guidance (1 or 5 recommended). Using 5 provides better temporal consistency but requires more memory
- **guidance_scale**: Controls how closely the output follows the text prompt. Higher values (5-7) produce results more aligned with the prompt. For Wan-Animate, CFG is disabled by default (`guidance_scale=1.0`) but can be enabled to support negative prompts and finer control over facial expressions. (Note that CFG will only target the text prompt and face conditioning.)

## Notes

- Wan2.1 supports LoRAs with [load_lora_weights()](/docs/diffusers/v0.40.0/en/api/loaders/lora#diffusers.loaders.WanLoraLoaderMixin.load_lora_weights).

- Set the [AutoencoderKLWan](/docs/diffusers/v0.40.0/en/api/models/autoencoder_kl_wan#diffusers.AutoencoderKLWan) dtype to `torch.float32` for better decoding quality.

- The number of frames per second (fps) or `k` should be calculated by `4 * k + 1`.

- Try lower `shift` values (`2.0` to `5.0`) for lower resolution videos and higher `shift` values (`7.0` to `12.0`) for higher resolution images.

- Wan 2.1 and 2.2 support using [LightX2V LoRAs](https://huggingface.co/Kijai/WanVideo_comfy/tree/main/Lightx2v) to speed up inference. Using them on Wan 2.2 is slightly more involed.

return_dict (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `True`) : Whether or not to return a `WanPipelineOutput` instead of a plain tuple.

attention_kwargs (`dict`, *optional*) : A kwargs dictionary that if specified is passed along to the `AttentionProcessor` as defined under `self.processor` in [diffusers.models.attention_processor](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/blob/main/src/diffusers/models/attention_processor.py).

callback_on_step_end (`Callable`, `PipelineCallback`, `MultiPipelineCallbacks`, *optional*) : A function or a subclass of `PipelineCallback` or `MultiPipelineCallbacks` that is called at the end of each denoising step during the inference. with the following arguments: `callback_on_step_end(self: DiffusionPipeline, step: int, timestep: int, callback_kwargs: Dict)`. `callback_kwargs` will include a list of all tensors as specified by `callback_on_step_end_tensor_inputs`.

**Returns:** `~WanPipelineOutput` or `tuple`

If `return_dict` is `True`, `WanPipelineOutput` is returned, otherwise a `tuple` is returned where
the first element is a list with the generated images and the second element is a list of `bool`s
indicating whether the corresponding generated image contains "not-safe-for-work" (nsfw) content.

**Parameters:**

prompt (`str` or `list[str]`, *optional*) : The prompt or prompts to guide the image generation. If not defined, one has to pass `prompt_embeds` instead.

negative_prompt (`str` or `list[str]`, *optional*) : The prompt or prompts not to guide the image generation. If not defined, one has to pass `negative_prompt_embeds` instead. Ignored when not using guidance (i.e., ignored if `guidance_scale` is less than `1`).

video (`list[PIL.Image.Image]`, *optional*) : The input video or videos to be used as a starting point for the generation. The video should be a list of PIL images, a numpy array, or a torch tensor. Currently, the pipeline only supports generating one video at a time.

mask (`list[PIL.Image.Image]`, *optional*) : The input mask defines which video regions to condition on and which to generate. Black areas in the mask indicate conditioning regions, while white areas indicate regions for generation. The mask should be a list of PIL images, a numpy array, or a torch tensor. Currently supports generating a single video at a time.

reference_images (`list[PIL.Image.Image]`, *optional*) : A list of one or more reference images as extra conditioning for the generation. For example, if you are trying to inpaint a video to change the character, you can pass reference images of the new character here. Refer to the Diffusers [examples](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/pull/11582) and original [user guide](https://github.com/ali-vilab/VACE/blob/0897c6d055d7d9ea9e191dce763006664d9780f8/UserGuide.md) for a full list of supported tasks and use cases.

conditioning_scale (`float`, `list[float]`, `torch.Tensor`, defaults to `1.0`) : The conditioning scale to be applied when adding the control conditioning latent stream to the denoising latent stream in each control layer of the model. If a float is provided, it will be applied uniformly to all layers. If a list or tensor is provided, it should have the same length as the number of control layers in the model (`len(transformer.config.vace_layers)`).

height (`int`, defaults to `480`) : The height in pixels of the generated image.

width (`int`, defaults to `832`) : The width in pixels of the generated image.

num_frames (`int`, defaults to `81`) : The number of frames in the generated video.

num_inference_steps (`int`, defaults to `50`) : The number of denoising steps. More denoising steps usually lead to a higher quality image at the expense of slower inference.

guidance_scale (`float`, defaults to `5.0`) : Guidance scale as defined in [Classifier-Free Diffusion Guidance](https://huggingface.co/papers/2207.12598). `guidance_scale` is defined as `w` of equation 2. of [Imagen Paper](https://huggingface.co/papers/2205.11487). Guidance scale is enabled by setting `guidance_scale > 1`. Higher guidance scale encourages to generate images that are closely linked to the text `prompt`, usually at the expense of lower image quality.

guidance_scale_2 (`float`, *optional*, defaults to `None`) : Guidance scale for the low-noise stage transformer (`transformer_2`). If `None` and the pipeline's `boundary_ratio` is not None, uses the same value as `guidance_scale`. Only used when `transformer_2` and the pipeline's `boundary_ratio` are not None.

num_videos_per_prompt (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 1) : The number of images to generate per prompt.

generator (`torch.Generator` or `list[torch.Generator]`, *optional*) : A [`torch.Generator`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.Generator.html) to make generation deterministic.

latents (`torch.Tensor`, *optional*) : Pre-generated noisy latents sampled from a Gaussian distribution, to be used as inputs for image generation. Can be used to tweak the same generation with different prompts. If not provided, a latents tensor is generated by sampling using the supplied random `generator`.

prompt_embeds (`torch.Tensor`, *optional*) : Pre-generated text embeddings. Can be used to easily tweak text inputs (prompt weighting). If not provided, text embeddings are generated from the `prompt` input argument.

negative_prompt_embeds (`torch.Tensor`, *optional*) : Pre-generated negative text embeddings. Can be used to easily tweak text inputs (prompt weighting). If not provided, `negative_prompt_embeds` are generated from the `negative_prompt` input argument.

output_type (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"np"`) : The output format of the generated image. Choose between `PIL.Image` or `np.array`.

return_dict (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `True`) : Whether or not to return a `WanPipelineOutput` instead of a plain tuple.

attention_kwargs (`dict`, *optional*) : A kwargs dictionary that if specified is passed along to the `AttentionProcessor` as defined under `self.processor` in [diffusers.models.attention_processor](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/blob/main/src/diffusers/models/attention_processor.py).

callback_on_step_end (`Callable`, `PipelineCallback`, `MultiPipelineCallbacks`, *optional*) : A function or a subclass of `PipelineCallback` or `MultiPipelineCallbacks` that is called at the end of each denoising step during the inference. with the following arguments: `callback_on_step_end(self: DiffusionPipeline, step: int, timestep: int, callback_kwargs: Dict)`. `callback_kwargs` will include a list of all tensors as specified by `callback_on_step_end_tensor_inputs`.

callback_on_step_end_tensor_inputs (`list`, *optional*) : The list of tensor inputs for the `callback_on_step_end` function. The tensors specified in the list will be passed as `callback_kwargs` argument. You will only be able to include variables listed in the `._callback_tensor_inputs` attribute of your pipeline class.

max_sequence_length (`int`, defaults to `512`) : The maximum sequence length of the text encoder. If the prompt is longer than this, it will be truncated. If the prompt is shorter, it will be padded to this length.

**Returns:** `~WanPipelineOutput` or `tuple`

If `return_dict` is `True`, `WanPipelineOutput` is returned, otherwise a `tuple` is returned where
the first element is a list with the generated images and the second element is a list of `bool`s
indicating whether the corresponding generated image contains "not-safe-for-work" (nsfw) content.

2. **Replacement mode**: The model replaces a character in a background video with the provided character image,
   using the pose and face videos for motion control. This mode requires additional `background_video` and
   `mask_video` inputs. The mask video should have black regions where the original content should be preserved and
   white regions where the new character should be generated.

This model inherits from [DiffusionPipeline](/docs/diffusers/v0.40.0/en/api/pipelines/overview#diffusers.DiffusionPipeline). Check the superclass documentation for the generic methods
implemented for all pipelines (downloading, saving, running on a particular device, etc.).

The pipeline also inherits the following loading methods:
- [load_lora_weights()](/docs/diffusers/v0.40.0/en/api/loaders/lora#diffusers.loaders.WanLoraLoaderMixin.load_lora_weights) for loading LoRA weights

**Parameters:**

image (`PipelineImageInput`) : The input character image to condition the generation on. Must be an image, a list of images or a `torch.Tensor`.

pose_video (`list[PIL.Image.Image]`) : The input pose video to condition the generation on. Must be a list of PIL images.

face_video (`list[PIL.Image.Image]`) : The input face video to condition the generation on. Must be a list of PIL images.

background_video (`list[PIL.Image.Image]`, *optional*) : When mode is `"replace"`, the input background video to condition the generation on. Must be a list of PIL images.

mask_video (`list[PIL.Image.Image]`, *optional*) : When mode is `"replace"`, the input mask video to condition the generation on. Must be a list of PIL images.

prompt (`str` or `list[str]`, *optional*) : The prompt or prompts to guide the image generation. If not defined, one has to pass `prompt_embeds`. instead.

negative_prompt (`str` or `list[str]`, *optional*) : The prompt or prompts not to guide the image generation. If not defined, one has to pass `negative_prompt_embeds` instead. Ignored when not using guidance (i.e., ignored if `guidance_scale` is less than `1`).

mode (`str`, defaults to `"animation"`) : The mode of the generation. Choose between `"animate"` and `"replace"`.

prev_segment_conditioning_frames (`int`, defaults to `1`) : The number of frames from the previous video segment to be used for temporal guidance. Recommended to be 1 or 5. In general, should be 4N + 1, where N is a non-negative integer.

motion_encode_batch_size (`int`, *optional*) : The batch size for batched encoding of the face video via the motion encoder. This allows trading off inference speed for lower memory usage by setting a smaller batch size. Will default to `self.transformer.config.motion_encoder_batch_size` if not set.

height (`int`, defaults to `720`) : The height of the generated video.

width (`int`, defaults to `1280`) : The width of the generated video.

segment_frame_length (`int`, defaults to `77`) : The number of frames in each generated video segment. The total frames of video generated will be equal to the number of frames in `pose_video`; we will generate the video in segments until we have hit this length. In general, should be 4N + 1, where N is a non-negative integer.

num_inference_steps (`int`, defaults to `20`) : The number of denoising steps. More denoising steps usually lead to a higher quality image at the expense of slower inference.

guidance_scale (`float`, defaults to `1.0`) : Guidance scale as defined in [Classifier-Free Diffusion Guidance](https://huggingface.co/papers/2207.12598). `guidance_scale` is defined as `w` of equation 2. of [Imagen Paper](https://huggingface.co/papers/2205.11487). Guidance scale is enabled by setting `guidance_scale > 1`. Higher guidance scale encourages to generate images that are closely linked to the text `prompt`, usually at the expense of lower image quality. By default, CFG is not used in Wan Animate inference.

num_videos_per_prompt (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 1) : The number of images to generate per prompt.

generator (`torch.Generator` or `list[torch.Generator]`, *optional*) : A [`torch.Generator`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.Generator.html) to make generation deterministic.

latents (`torch.Tensor`, *optional*) : Pre-generated noisy latents sampled from a Gaussian distribution, to be used as inputs for image generation. Can be used to tweak the same generation with different prompts. If not provided, a latents tensor is generated by sampling using the supplied random `generator`.

prompt_embeds (`torch.Tensor`, *optional*) : Pre-generated text embeddings. Can be used to easily tweak text inputs (prompt weighting). If not provided, text embeddings are generated from the `prompt` input argument.

negative_prompt_embeds (`torch.Tensor`, *optional*) : Pre-generated text embeddings. Can be used to easily tweak text inputs (prompt weighting). If not provided, text embeddings are generated from the `negative_prompt` input argument.

image_embeds (`torch.Tensor`, *optional*) : Pre-generated image embeddings. Can be used to easily tweak image inputs (weighting). If not provided, image embeddings are generated from the `image` input argument.

output_type (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"np"`) : The output format of the generated image. Choose between `PIL.Image` or `np.array`.

return_dict (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `True`) : Whether or not to return a `WanPipelineOutput` instead of a plain tuple.

attention_kwargs (`dict`, *optional*) : A kwargs dictionary that if specified is passed along to the `AttentionProcessor` as defined under `self.processor` in [diffusers.models.attention_processor](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/blob/main/src/diffusers/models/attention_processor.py).

callback_on_step_end (`Callable`, `PipelineCallback`, `MultiPipelineCallbacks`, *optional*) : A function or a subclass of `PipelineCallback` or `MultiPipelineCallbacks` that is called at the end of each denoising step during the inference. with the following arguments: `callback_on_step_end(self: DiffusionPipeline, step: int, timestep: int, callback_kwargs: Dict)`. `callback_kwargs` will include a list of all tensors as specified by `callback_on_step_end_tensor_inputs`.

callback_on_step_end_tensor_inputs (`List`, *optional*) : The list of tensor inputs for the `callback_on_step_end` function. The tensors specified in the list will be passed as `callback_kwargs` argument. You will only be able to include variables listed in the `._callback_tensor_inputs` attribute of your pipeline class.

max_sequence_length (`int`, defaults to `512`) : The maximum sequence length of the text encoder. If the prompt is longer than this, it will be truncated. If the prompt is shorter, it will be padded to this length.

**Returns:** `~WanPipelineOutput` or `tuple`

If `return_dict` is `True`, `WanPipelineOutput` is returned, otherwise a `tuple` is returned where
the first element is a list with the generated images and the second element is a list of `bool`s
indicating whether the corresponding generated image contains "not-safe-for-work" (nsfw) content.

The call function to the pipeline for generation.
