# How to configure OIDC SSO with Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD)

This guide will use Microsoft Entra ID as the SSO provider and the Open ID Connect (OIDC) protocol as our preferred identity protocol.

> [!WARNING]
> This feature is part of the Team & Enterprise plans.

## Step 1: Create a new application in your Identity Provider

Open a new tab/window in your browser and sign in to the Azure portal of your organization.

Navigate to the Microsoft Entra ID admin center and click on "Enterprise applications"

You'll be redirected to this page. Then click "New application" at the top and "Create your own application".

Input a name for your application (for example, Hugging Face SSO), then select "Register an application to integrate with Microsoft Entra ID (App you're developing)".

## Step 2: Configure your application on Azure

Open a new tab/window in your browser and navigate to the SSO section of your organization's settings. Select the OIDC protocol.

Copy the "Redirection URI" from the organization's settings on Hugging Face and paste it into the "Redirect URI" field on Azure Entra ID. Make sure you select "Web" in the dropdown menu.
The URL looks like this: `https://huggingface.co/organizations/[organizationIdentifier]/oidc/consume`.

Save your new application.

## Step 3: Finalize configuration on Hugging Face

We will need to collect the following information to finalize the setup on Hugging Face:

- The Client ID of the OIDC app
- A Client secret of the OIDC app
- The Issuer URL of the OIDC app

In Microsoft Entra ID, navigate to Enterprise applications, and click on your newly created application in the list.

In the application overview, click on "Single sign-on", then "Go to application"

In the OIDC app overview, you will find a copiable field named "Application (client) ID".
Copy that ID to your clipboard and paste it into the "Client ID" field on Huggingface.

Next, click "Endpoints" in the top menu in Microsoft Entra.
Copy the value in the "OpenID connect metadata document" field and paste it into the "Issue URL" field in Hugging Face.

Back in Microsoft Entra, navigate to "Certificates & secrets", and generate a new secret by clicking "New client secret".

Once you have created the secret, copy the secret value and paste it into the "Client secret" field on Hugging Face.

You can now click "Update and Test OIDC configuration" to save the settings.

You should be redirected to your SSO provider (IdP) login prompt. Once logged in, you'll be redirected to your organization's settings page.

A green check mark near the OIDC selector will attest that the test was successful.

## Step 4: Enable SSO in your organization

Now that Single Sign-On is configured and tested, you can enable it for members of your organization by clicking on the "Enable" button.

Once enabled, members of your organization must complete the SSO authentication flow described in the [How it works](./security-sso-basic#how-it-works) section.
