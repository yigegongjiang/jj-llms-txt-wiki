# Hub Integration

Inference Providers is tightly integrated with the Hugging Face Hub. No matter which provider you use, the usage and billing will be centralized in your Hugging Face account.

## Model search

When listing models on the Hub, you can filter to select models deployed on the inference provider of your choice. For example, to list all models deployed on Fireworks AI infra: https://huggingface.co/models?inference_provider=fireworks-ai.

    
    

It is also possible to select all or multiple providers and filter their available models: https://huggingface.co/models?inference_provider=all.

    
    

## Features using Inference Providers

Several Hugging Face features utilize Inference Providers and count towards your monthly credits. The included monthly credits for PRO and Enterprise should cover moderate usage of these features for most users.

### Inference Widgets

Interactive widgets available on model pages (e.g. [deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3-0324](https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3-0324)). This is the entry point to quickly test a model on the Hub.
