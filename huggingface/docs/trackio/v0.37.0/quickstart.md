# Quickstart Guide

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/gradio-app/trackio/blob/main/examples/notebooks/quickstart.ipynb)

To get started, you can run a simple example that logs some fake training metrics:

```python
import trackio
import random
import time

runs = 3
epochs = 8

for run in range(runs):
    trackio.init(
        project="my-project",
        config={"epochs": epochs, "learning_rate": 0.001, "batch_size": 64}
    )

    for epoch in range(epochs):
        train_loss = random.uniform(0.2, 1.0)
        train_acc = random.uniform(0.6, 0.95)

        val_loss = train_loss - random.uniform(0.01, 0.1)
        val_acc = train_acc + random.uniform(0.01, 0.05)

        trackio.log({
            "epoch": epoch,
            "train_loss": train_loss,
            "train_accuracy": train_acc,
            "val_loss": val_loss,
            "val_accuracy": val_acc
        })

        time.sleep(0.2)

trackio.finish()
```

Running the above will print to the terminal instructions on launching the dashboard.

The usage of `trackio` is designed to be identical to `wandb` in most cases, so you can easily switch between the two libraries.

```py
import trackio as wandb
```

## Dashboard

You can launch the dashboard by running:

```sh
trackio show
```

```py
import trackio

trackio.show()
```

You can also provide an optional `project` name as the argument to load a specific project directly:

```sh
trackio show --project "my-project"
```

```py
import trackio 

trackio.show(project="my-project")
```

## Deploying to Hugging Face Spaces

When calling `trackio.init()`, by default the service will run locally and store project data on the local machine.

But if you pass a `space_id` to [init()](/docs/trackio/v0.37.0/en/api#trackio.init), like:

```py
trackio.init(project="my-project", space_id="orgname/space_id")
```

or

```py
trackio.init(project="my-project", space_id="username/space_id")
```

it will use an existing or automatically deploy a new Hugging Face Space as needed. You should be logged in with the `huggingface-cli` locally and your token should have write permissions to create the Space.

Alternatively, you can sync an existing local project to a Hugging Face Space by running:

```sh
trackio sync --project "my-project" --space-id "username/space_id"
```

```py
trackio.sync(project="my-project", space_id="username/space_id")
```

This will create the Space if it does not already exist, and upload all runs and associated data to the Space. You can also sync to a lightweight static Space with `sdk="static"`, or create a read-only snapshot of a live Space with [`freeze`](deploy_embed#freezing-a-space-snapshot). A frozen Space is a point-in-time snapshot and will not pick up later metrics from the original Gradio Space unless you freeze again. See the [Deploy and Embed Dashboards](deploy_embed) page for more details.
