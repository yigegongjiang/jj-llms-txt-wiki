# Self-host the Trackio server

You can run the Trackio dashboard and API on your own machine (or any host you control) and send metrics from training scripts to that server over HTTP. This is an alternative to logging to a Hugging Face Space via `space_id`.

## Run the server locally

Install Trackio, then start the dashboard. By default it listens on `127.0.0.1` and uses the port from `GRADIO_SERVER_PORT` if set, otherwise **7860** (see [Launch the Dashboard](launch)).

```sh
trackio show
```

```py
import trackio

trackio.show()
```

Leave that process running while you train. The terminal prints a base URL for the UI and a URL that includes a **write token**; anyone who can reach that URL with the token can perform write operations supported by the server (for example renaming runs), so treat it like a secret on untrusted networks.

## Listen on all interfaces

To access the dashboard from another machine on your network (or from containers), bind to all interfaces:

```sh
trackio show --host 0.0.0.0
```

```py
import trackio

trackio.show(host="0.0.0.0")
```

Ensure your firewall and security policies allow the traffic you intend.

## Point training code at your server

In your training script, pass a `server_url` and supply the **write token**: either embed `write_token` in the query string (the same URL the dashboard prints for write access, or the `full_url` return value from `trackio.show()`), or pass a base URL like `http://127.0.0.1:7860/` and set the `TRACKIO_WRITE_TOKEN` environment variable to that token. You can also set `TRACKIO_WRITE_TOKEN` on the Trackio server before launching `trackio.show()` to choose the server's write token instead of using the random token generated at startup. Metric ingestion and uploads require this token when the server is not on Hugging Face Spaces. You can also set `TRACKIO_SERVER_URL` instead of passing `server_url` in code.

```py
import trackio

trackio.init(
    project="my-project",
    server_url="http://127.0.0.1:7860?write_token=YOUR_TOKEN",
)
trackio.log({"loss": 0.25})
trackio.finish()
```

Precedence: **`space_id` / `TRACKIO_SPACE_ID` always wins** over `server_url` / `TRACKIO_SERVER_URL` when both are set (in code or in the environment). Trackio then behaves as if only the Space were configured.

Hugging Face–specific options such as `dataset_id` (deprecated; use `bucket_id` instead) and `bucket_id` apply only when logging to a Space. When only `server_url` is in effect, configure persistence on the machine where the server runs (for example via `TRACKIO_DIR` on that host). See [Environment Variables](environment_variables).
