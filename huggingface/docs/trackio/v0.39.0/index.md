# Trackio

`trackio` is a lightweight, free experiment tracking Python library built on top of Hugging Face Buckets and Spaces 🤗.

- **API compatible** with `wandb.init`, `wandb.log`, and `wandb.finish`. Drop-in replacement: just

  ```python
  import trackio as wandb
  ```

- **Local-first** design: dashboard runs locally by default. You can also log to a Hugging Face Space (`space_id`) for free or to a **self-hosted** Trackio server (`server_url`)
- Persists logs locally, in a Hugging Face Bucket when using Spaces, or on the machine hosting your self-hosted server. (Persisting to a Hugging Face Dataset via `dataset_id` / `TRACKIO_DATASET_ID` is deprecated and will be removed in a future version; use a Bucket via `bucket_id` / `TRACKIO_BUCKET_ID` instead.)
- Visualize experiments with a Gradio dashboard locally, on Hugging Face Spaces, or on your own host when self-hosting
- **LLM-friendly**: Designed for autonomous ML experiments with CLI commands and Python APIs that enable LLMs to easily log and query experiment data.
- Everything here, including hosting on Hugging Face, is **free**!

Trackio is designed to be lightweight (the core codebase is <3,000 lines of Python code), not fully-featured. It is designed in an extensible way and written entirely in Python so that developers can easily fork the repository and add functionality that they care about.
