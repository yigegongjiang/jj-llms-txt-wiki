## Get started

To just run a PPO script to make sure the trainer can run, you can run the following command to train a PPO model with a dummy reward model.

```bash
python examples/ppo_sentiment/ppo_sentiment.py \
    --dataset_name trl-internal-testing/descriptiveness-sentiment-trl-style \
    --dataset_train_split descriptiveness \
    --learning_rate 3e-6 \
    --num_ppo_epochs 1 \
    --num_mini_batches 1 \
    --output_dir models/minimal/ppo \
    --per_device_train_batch_size 64 \
    --gradient_accumulation_steps 1 \
    --total_episodes 10000 \
    --model_name_or_path EleutherAI/pythia-1b-deduped \
    --sft_model_path EleutherAI/pythia-1b-deduped \
    --reward_model_path EleutherAI/pythia-1b-deduped \
    --missing_eos_penalty 1.0
```

## Explanation of the logged metrics

The logged metrics are as follows. Here is an example [tracked run at Weights and Biases](https://wandb.ai/huggingface/trl/runs/dd2o3g35)

- `eps`: Tracks the number of episodes per second.
- `objective/kl`: The mean Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the current policy and reference policy.
- `objective/entropy`: The mean token-level entropy proxy on sampled rollouts, computed as `(-logprobs).sum(1).mean()` before PPO optimization.
- `objective/non_score_reward`: The mean reward from non-score-related sources, basically `beta * kl.sum(1)`, where `beta` is the KL penalty coefficient and `kl` is the per-token KL divergence.
- `objective/rlhf_reward`: The mean RLHF reward, which is `score - non_score_reward`.
- `objective/scores`: The mean scores returned by the reward model / environment.
- `policy/approxkl_avg`: The average approximate KL divergence between consecutive PPO policies. Note that this is not the same as `objective/kl`.
- `policy/clipfrac_avg`: The average fraction of policy updates that are clipped, indicating how often the policy updates are constrained to prevent large changes.
- `loss/policy_avg`: The average policy loss, indicating how well the policy is performing.
- `loss/value_avg`: The average value loss, indicating the difference between the predicted value and the actual reward.
- `val/clipfrac_avg`: The average fraction of value function updates that are clipped, similar to policy/clipfrac_avg but for the value function.
- `policy/entropy_avg`: The average categorical entropy of the current policy during PPO optimization, computed from `logits` each minibatch and averaged across PPO epochs/minibatches.
- `val/ratio`: The mean ratio of the current policy probability to the old policy probability, providing a measure of how much the policy has changed.
- `val/ratio_var`: The variance of the `val/ratio`, indicating the variability in policy changes.
- `val/num_eos_tokens`: The number of end-of-sequence (EOS) tokens generated, which can indicate the number of complete responses.
- `lr`: lr: The current learning rate used by the optimizer.
- `episode`: episode: The current episode count in the training process.

`objective/entropy` and `policy/entropy_avg` are intentionally different signals:

- `objective/entropy` is measured on the sampled behavior-policy rollouts used to build PPO advantages for the current update.
- `policy/entropy_avg` is measured during PPO optimization on the evolving policy (after gradient steps), so it can diverge from `objective/entropy`.

## Cookbook

- Debugging TIP: `objective/rlhf_reward`: this is the ultimate objective of the RLHF training. If training works as intended, this metric should keep going up.
- Debugging TIP: `val/ratio`: this number should float around 1.0, and it gets clipped by `--cliprange 0.2` with PPO's surrogate loss. So if this `ratio` is too high like 2.0 or 1000.0 or too small like 0.1, it means the updates between consecutive policies are too drastic. You should try understand why this is happening and try to fix it.
- Memory TIP: If you are running out of memory, you can try to reduce the `--per_device_train_batch_size` or increase the `--gradient_accumulation_steps` to reduce the memory footprint.
- Memory TIP: If you have multiple GPUs, you can also run training with DeepSpeed stage 3 to reduce the memory footprint `accelerate launch --config_file examples/accelerate_configs/deepspeed_zero3.yaml`.
- Usage TIP: We recommend to use the "EOS trick" via `--missing_eos_penalty`, which subtracts a static scalar penalty from the score of completions that do not end with an EOS token. This can help the model learn to generate more coherent completions.

## What is my model doing exactly?

To help you understand what your model is doing, we periodically log some sample completions from the model. Here is an example of a completion. In an example [tracked run at Weights and Biases](https://wandb.ai/huggingface/trl/runs/dd2o3g35), it looks like the following, allowing you to see the model's response at different stages of training. By default we generate `--num_sample_generations 10` during training, but you can customize the number of generations.

In the logs the sampled generations look like

## Implementation details

This PPO implementation is based on the [The N+ Implementation Details of RLHF with PPO: A Case Study on TL;DR Summarization](https://huggingface.co/papers/2403.17031).

## Benchmark experiments

To validate the PPO implementation works, we ran experiment on the 1B model. Here are the command we used to run the experiment. We take the SFT / RM models directly from [The N+ Implementation Details of RLHF with PPO: A Case Study on TL;DR Summarization](https://huggingface.co/papers/2403.17031).

Checkpoints and experiment tracking are available at:

- [🤗 Model checkpoint](https://huggingface.co/trl-lib/ppo_tldr)
- [🐝 Tracked experiment](https://wandb.ai/huggingface/trl/runs/dd2o3g35)

The PPO checkpoint gets a 64.7% preferred rate vs the 33.0% preference rate of the SFT checkpoint (evaluated with GPT-4o mini as a judge). This is a good sign that the PPO training is working as intended.

An autoregressive model with a value head in addition to the language model head. This class inherits from
[experimental.ppo.PreTrainedModelWrapper](/docs/trl/v1.12.0/en/ppo_trainer#trl.experimental.ppo.PreTrainedModelWrapper) and wraps a [PreTrainedModel](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/v5.16.1/en/main_classes/model#transformers.PreTrainedModel) class. The wrapper class
supports classic functions such as `from_pretrained`, `push_to_hub` and `generate`. To call a method of the wrapped
model, simply manipulate the `pretrained_model` attribute of this class.

Class attributes:
- **transformers_parent_class** ([PreTrainedModel](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/v5.16.1/en/main_classes/model#transformers.PreTrainedModel)) -- The parent class of the wrapped model.
  This
  should be set to `transformers.AutoModelForCausalLM` for this class.

  by the `ValueHead` class. Currently, the supported args are:
  - **summary_dropout_prob** (`float`, `optional`, defaults to `None`) -- The dropout probability for the
    `ValueHead` class.
  - **v_head_initializer_range** (`float`, `optional`, defaults to `0.2`) -- The initializer range for the
    `ValueHead` if a specific initialization strategy is selected.
  - **v_head_init_strategy** (`str`, `optional`, defaults to `None`) -- The initialization strategy for the
    `ValueHead`. Currently, the supported strategies are:
    - **`None`** -- Initializes the weights of the `ValueHead` with a random distribution. This is the
      default strategy.
    - **"normal"** -- Initializes the weights of the `ValueHead` with a normal distribution.

forward(input_ids = None, past_key_values = None, attention_mask = None, return_past_key_values = False, **kwargs)
```

[Source](https://github.com/huggingface/trl/blob/v1.12.0/trl/experimental/ppo/modeling_value_head.py#L716)

**Parameters:**

input_ids (*torch.LongTensor* of shape *(batch_size, sequence_length)*) : Indices of input sequence tokens in the vocabulary.

past_key_values (*tuple(tuple(torch.FloatTensor))*, *optional*) : Contains pre-computed hidden-states (key and values in the attention blocks) as computed by the model (see *past_key_values* input) to speed up sequential decoding.

attention_mask (*torch.FloatTensor* of shape *(batch_size, sequence_length)*, *optional*) : Mask to avoid performing attention on padding token indices. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`: - 1 for tokens that are **not masked**, - 0 for tokens that are **masked**.

return_past_key_values (bool) : A flag indicating if the computed hidden-states should be returned.

kwargs (*dict*, *optional*) : Additional keyword arguments, that are passed to the wrapped model.

Applies a forward pass to the wrapped model and returns the logits of the value head.

#### generate[[trl.experimental.ppo.AutoModelForCausalLMWithValueHead.generate]]

```python
generate(*args, **kwargs)
```

[Source](https://github.com/huggingface/trl/blob/v1.12.0/trl/experimental/ppo/modeling_value_head.py#L771)

**Parameters:**

- ***args** (`list`, *optional*) : Positional arguments passed to the `generate` method of the wrapped model.

- ****kwargs** (`dict`, *optional*) : Keyword arguments passed to the `generate` method of the wrapped model.

A simple wrapper around the `generate` method of the wrapped model. Please refer to the
[`generate`](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/internal/generation_utils) method of the wrapped model
for more information about the supported arguments.

#### _init_weights[[trl.experimental.ppo.AutoModelForCausalLMWithValueHead._init_weights]]

```python
_init_weights(**kwargs)
```

[Source](https://github.com/huggingface/trl/blob/v1.12.0/trl/experimental/ppo/modeling_value_head.py#L694)

**Parameters:**

- ****kwargs** (`dict`, `optional`) : Additional keyword arguments, that are passed to the `ValueHead` class. These arguments can contain the `v_head_init_strategy` argument as well as the `v_head_initializer_range` argument.

Initializes the weights of the value head. The default initialization strategy is random. Users can pass a
different initialization strategy by passing the `v_head_init_strategy` argument when calling
`.from_pretrained`. Supported strategies are:
- `normal`: initializes the weights with a normal distribution.

#### trl.experimental.ppo.AutoModelForSeq2SeqLMWithValueHead[[trl.experimental.ppo.AutoModelForSeq2SeqLMWithValueHead]]

```python
trl.experimental.ppo.AutoModelForSeq2SeqLMWithValueHead(pretrained_model, **kwargs)
```

[Source](https://github.com/huggingface/trl/blob/v1.12.0/trl/experimental/ppo/modeling_value_head.py#L851)

**Parameters:**

pretrained_model ([PreTrainedModel](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/v5.16.1/en/main_classes/model#transformers.PreTrainedModel)) : The model to wrap. It should be a causal language model such as GPT2. or any model mapped inside the [AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/v5.16.1/en/model_doc/auto#transformers.AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM) class.

kwargs : Additional keyword arguments passed along to the `ValueHead` class.

A seq2seq model with a value head in addition to the language model head. This class inherits from
[experimental.ppo.PreTrainedModelWrapper](/docs/trl/v1.12.0/en/ppo_trainer#trl.experimental.ppo.PreTrainedModelWrapper) and wraps a [PreTrainedModel](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/v5.16.1/en/main_classes/model#transformers.PreTrainedModel) class. The wrapper class
supports classic functions such as `from_pretrained` and `push_to_hub` and also provides some additional
functionalities such as `generate`.
