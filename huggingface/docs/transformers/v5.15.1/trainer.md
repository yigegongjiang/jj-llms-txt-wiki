# Trainer

[Trainer](/docs/transformers/v5.15.1/en/main_classes/trainer#transformers.Trainer) is a complete training and evaluation loop for Transformers models. You only need a model and dataset to get started.

Underneath, [Trainer](/docs/transformers/v5.15.1/en/main_classes/trainer#transformers.Trainer) handles batching, shuffling, and padding your dataset into tensors. The training loop runs the forward pass, calculates loss, backpropagates gradients, and updates weights. Configure the training run with [TrainingArguments](/docs/transformers/v5.15.1/en/main_classes/trainer#transformers.TrainingArguments) to customize everything from batch size and training duration to distributed strategies, compilation, and more.
