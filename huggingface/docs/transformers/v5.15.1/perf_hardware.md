# Building a GPU workstation

The GPU is one of the most important choices when building a deep learning machine. Tensor cores handle matrix multiplication efficiently, and high memory bandwidth keeps data flowing. Training large models requires a more powerful GPU, multiple GPUs, or offloading techniques that move work to the CPU or NVMe.

The tips below cover practical GPU setup for deep learning.

## Power

High-end consumer GPUs may have two or three PCIe 8-pin power sockets. Connect a separate 12V PCIe 8-pin cable to each socket. Don't use a *pigtail cable* (a single cable with two splits at one end) to connect two sockets, otherwise, you won't get full performance from the GPU.

Connect each PCIe 8-pin power cable to a 12V rail on the power supply unit (PSU). Each cable delivers up to 150W. Some GPUs use a PCIe 12-pin connector that delivers up to 500-600W. Lower-end GPUs may use a PCIe 6-pin connector that supplies up to 75W.

A PSU must maintain stable voltage because unstable voltage can starve the GPU of power during peak usage.

## Cooling

An overheated GPU throttles performance and shuts down to prevent damage. Keep temperatures between 158–167°F (70–75 Celsius) for full performance and a longer lifespan. Above 183–194°F (84–90 Celsius), the GPU usually starts throttling.

## Multi-GPU connectivity

How your GPUs connect matters for multi-GPU setups. [NVLink](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/design-visualization/nvlink-bridges/) connections are faster than PCIe bridges, but the impact depends on your parallelism strategy. DDP has less GPU-to-GPU communication than ZeRO, so connection speed matters less.

Run the command below to check how your GPUs are connected.

```bash
nvidia-smi topo -m
```

[NVLink](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/design-visualization/nvlink-bridges/) is NVIDIA's high-speed communication system for connecting multiple GPUs.

```bash
        GPU0    GPU1    CPU Affinity    NUMA Affinity
GPU0     X      NV2     0-23            N/A
GPU1    NV2      X      0-23            N/A
```

`NV2` indicates `GPU0` and `GPU1` are connected by 2 NVLinks.

```bash
        GPU0    GPU1    CPU Affinity    NUMA Affinity
GPU0     X      PHB     0-11            N/A
GPU1    PHB      X      0-11            N/A
```

`PHB` indicates `GPU0` and `GPU1` are connected by a PCIe bridge.
