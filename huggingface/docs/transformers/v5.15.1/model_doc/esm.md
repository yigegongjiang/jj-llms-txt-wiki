# ESM

## Overview

This page provides code and pre-trained weights for Transformer protein language models from Meta AI's Fundamental
AI Research Team, providing the state-of-the-art ESMFold and ESM-2, and the previously released ESM-1b and ESM-1v.
Transformer protein language models were introduced in the paper [Biological structure and function emerge from scaling
unsupervised learning to 250 million protein sequences](https://www.pnas.org/content/118/15/e2016239118) by
Alexander Rives, Joshua Meier, Tom Sercu, Siddharth Goyal, Zeming Lin, Jason Liu, Demi Guo, Myle Ott,
C. Lawrence Zitnick, Jerry Ma, and Rob Fergus.
The first version of this paper was [preprinted in 2019](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/622803v1?versioned=true).

ESM-2 outperforms all tested single-sequence protein language models across a range of structure prediction tasks,
and enables atomic resolution structure prediction.
It was released with the paper [Language models of protein sequences at the scale of evolution enable accurate
structure prediction](https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.07.20.500902) by Zeming Lin, Halil Akin, Roshan Rao, Brian Hie,
Zhongkai Zhu, Wenting Lu, Allan dos Santos Costa, Maryam Fazel-Zarandi, Tom Sercu, Sal Candido and Alexander Rives.

Also introduced in this paper was ESMFold. It uses an ESM-2 stem with a head that can predict folded protein
structures with state-of-the-art accuracy. Unlike [AlphaFold2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03819-2),
it relies on the token embeddings from the large pre-trained protein language model stem and does not perform a multiple
sequence alignment (MSA) step at inference time, which means that ESMFold checkpoints are fully "standalone" -
they do not require a database of known protein sequences and structures with associated external query tools
to make predictions, and are much faster as a result.

The abstract from
"Biological structure and function emerge from scaling unsupervised learning to 250
million protein sequences" is

*In the field of artificial intelligence, a combination of scale in data and model capacity enabled by unsupervised
learning has led to major advances in representation learning and statistical generation. In the life sciences, the
anticipated growth of sequencing promises unprecedented data on natural sequence diversity. Protein language modeling
at the scale of evolution is a logical step toward predictive and generative artificial intelligence for biology. To
this end, we use unsupervised learning to train a deep contextual language model on 86 billion amino acids across 250
million protein sequences spanning evolutionary diversity. The resulting model contains information about biological
properties in its representations. The representations are learned from sequence data alone. The learned representation
space has a multiscale organization reflecting structure from the level of biochemical properties of amino acids to
remote homology of proteins. Information about secondary and tertiary structure is encoded in the representations and
can be identified by linear projections. Representation learning produces features that generalize across a range of
applications, enabling state-of-the-art supervised prediction of mutational effect and secondary structure and
improving state-of-the-art features for long-range contact prediction.*

The abstract from
"Language models of protein sequences at the scale of evolution enable accurate structure prediction" is

*Large language models have recently been shown to develop emergent capabilities with scale, going beyond
simple pattern matching to perform higher level reasoning and generate lifelike images and text. While
language models trained on protein sequences have been studied at a smaller scale, little is known about
what they learn about biology as they are scaled up. In this work we train models up to 15 billion parameters,
the largest language models of proteins to be evaluated to date. We find that as models are scaled they learn
information enabling the prediction of the three-dimensional structure of a protein at the resolution of
individual atoms. We present ESMFold for high accuracy end-to-end atomic level structure prediction directly
from the individual sequence of a protein. ESMFold has similar accuracy to AlphaFold2 and RoseTTAFold for
sequences with low perplexity that are well understood by the language model. ESMFold inference is an
order of magnitude faster than AlphaFold2, enabling exploration of the structural space of metagenomic
proteins in practical timescales.*

the latter silently ignores them.

  weighted average in the cross-attention heads.

```python
transformers.EsmForSequenceClassification(config)
```

[Source](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/v5.15.1/src/transformers/models/esm/modeling_esm.py#L903)

**Parameters:**

config ([EsmForSequenceClassification](/docs/transformers/v5.15.1/en/model_doc/esm#transformers.EsmForSequenceClassification)) : Model configuration class with all the parameters of the model. Initializing with a config file does not load the weights associated with the model, only the configuration. Check out the [from_pretrained()](/docs/transformers/v5.15.1/en/main_classes/model#transformers.PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained) method to load the model weights.

ESM Model transformer with a sequence classification/regression head on top (a linear layer on top of the pooled
output) e.g. for GLUE tasks.

This model inherits from [PreTrainedModel](/docs/transformers/v5.15.1/en/main_classes/model#transformers.PreTrainedModel). Check the superclass documentation for the generic methods the
library implements for all its model (such as downloading or saving, resizing the input embeddings, pruning heads
etc.)

This model is also a PyTorch [torch.nn.Module](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module) subclass.
Use it as a regular PyTorch Module and refer to the PyTorch documentation for all matter related to general usage
and behavior.

#### forward[[transformers.EsmForSequenceClassification.forward]]

```python
forward(input_ids: typing.Optional[torch.LongTensor] = None, attention_mask: typing.Optional[torch.Tensor] = None, position_ids: typing.Optional[torch.LongTensor] = None, inputs_embeds: typing.Optional[torch.FloatTensor] = None, labels: typing.Optional[torch.LongTensor] = None, **kwargs: Unpack)
```

[Source](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/v5.15.1/src/transformers/models/esm/modeling_esm.py#L914)

**Parameters:**

input_ids (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, *optional*) : Indices of input sequence tokens in the vocabulary. Padding will be ignored by default.  Indices can be obtained using [AutoTokenizer](/docs/transformers/v5.15.1/en/model_doc/auto#transformers.AutoTokenizer). See [PreTrainedTokenizer.encode()](/docs/transformers/v5.15.1/en/internal/tokenization_utils#transformers.PreTrainedTokenizerBase.encode) and [PreTrainedTokenizer.__call__()](/docs/transformers/v5.15.1/en/internal/tokenization_utils#transformers.PreTrainedTokenizerBase.__call__) for details.  [What are input IDs?](../glossary#input-ids)

attention_mask (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, *optional*) : Mask to avoid performing attention on padding token indices. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:  - 1 for tokens that are **not masked**, - 0 for tokens that are **masked**.  [What are attention masks?](../glossary#attention-mask)

position_ids (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, *optional*) : Indices of positions of each input sequence tokens in the position embeddings. Selected in the range `[0, config.n_positions - 1]`.  [What are position IDs?](../glossary#position-ids)

inputs_embeds (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`, *optional*) : Optionally, instead of passing `input_ids` you can choose to directly pass an embedded representation. This is useful if you want more control over how to convert `input_ids` indices into associated vectors than the model's internal embedding lookup matrix.

labels (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size,)`, *optional*) : Labels for computing the sequence classification/regression loss. Indices should be in `[0, ..., config.num_labels - 1]`. If `config.num_labels == 1` a regression loss is computed (Mean-Square loss), If `config.num_labels > 1` a classification loss is computed (Cross-Entropy).

**Returns:** [SequenceClassifierOutput](/docs/transformers/v5.15.1/en/main_classes/output#transformers.modeling_outputs.SequenceClassifierOutput) or `tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`

A [SequenceClassifierOutput](/docs/transformers/v5.15.1/en/main_classes/output#transformers.modeling_outputs.SequenceClassifierOutput) or a tuple of
`torch.FloatTensor` (if `return_dict=False` is passed or when `config.return_dict=False`) comprising various
elements depending on the configuration ([EsmConfig](/docs/transformers/v5.15.1/en/model_doc/esm#transformers.EsmConfig)) and inputs.

The [EsmForSequenceClassification](/docs/transformers/v5.15.1/en/model_doc/esm#transformers.EsmForSequenceClassification) forward method, overrides the `__call__` special method.

Although the recipe for forward pass needs to be defined within this function, one should call the `Module`
instance afterwards instead of this since the former takes care of running the pre and post processing steps while
the latter silently ignores them.

- **loss** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(1,)`, *optional*, returned when `labels` is provided) -- Classification (or regression if config.num_labels==1) loss.
- **logits** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, config.num_labels)`) -- Classification (or regression if config.num_labels==1) scores (before SoftMax).
- **hidden_states** (`tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`, *optional*, returned when `output_hidden_states=True` is passed or when `config.output_hidden_states=True`) -- Tuple of `torch.FloatTensor` (one for the output of the embeddings, if the model has an embedding layer, +
  one for the output of each layer) of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`.

  Hidden-states of the model at the output of each layer plus the optional initial embedding outputs.
- **attentions** (`tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`, *optional*, returned when `output_attentions=True` is passed or when `config.output_attentions=True`) -- Tuple of `torch.FloatTensor` (one for each layer) of shape `(batch_size, num_heads, sequence_length,
  sequence_length)`.

  Attentions weights after the attention softmax, used to compute the weighted average in the self-attention
  heads.

Example of single-label classification:

```python
>>> import torch
>>> from transformers import AutoTokenizer, EsmForSequenceClassification

>>> inputs = tokenizer("Hello, my dog is cute", return_tensors="pt")

>>> with torch.no_grad():
...     logits = model(**inputs).logits

>>> predicted_class_id = logits.argmax().item()
>>> model.config.id2label[predicted_class_id]
...

>>> # To train a model on `num_labels` classes, you can pass `num_labels=num_labels` to `.from_pretrained(...)`
>>> num_labels = len(model.config.id2label)
>>> model = EsmForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained("facebook/esm-1b", num_labels=num_labels)

>>> labels = torch.tensor([1])
>>> loss = model(**inputs, labels=labels).loss
>>> round(loss.item(), 2)
...
```

Example of multi-label classification:

```python
>>> import torch
>>> from transformers import AutoTokenizer, EsmForSequenceClassification

>>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("facebook/esm-1b")
>>> model = EsmForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained("facebook/esm-1b", problem_type="multi_label_classification")

>>> inputs = tokenizer("Hello, my dog is cute", return_tensors="pt")

>>> with torch.no_grad():
...     logits = model(**inputs).logits

>>> predicted_class_ids = torch.arange(0, logits.shape[-1])[torch.sigmoid(logits).squeeze(dim=0) > 0.5]

>>> # To train a model on `num_labels` classes, you can pass `num_labels=num_labels` to `.from_pretrained(...)`
>>> num_labels = len(model.config.id2label)
>>> model = EsmForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(
...     "facebook/esm-1b", num_labels=num_labels, problem_type="multi_label_classification"
... )

>>> labels = torch.sum(
...     torch.nn.functional.one_hot(predicted_class_ids[None, :].clone(), num_classes=num_labels), dim=1
... ).to(torch.float)
>>> loss = model(**inputs, labels=labels).loss

Check out the [from_pretrained()](/docs/transformers/v5.15.1/en/main_classes/model#transformers.PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained) method to load the model weights.

ESMForProteinFolding is the HuggingFace port of the original ESMFold model. It consists of an ESM-2 "stem" followed
by a protein folding "head", although unlike most other output heads, this "head" is similar in size and runtime to
the rest of the model combined! It outputs a dictionary containing predicted structural information about the input
protein(s).

This model inherits from [PreTrainedModel](/docs/transformers/v5.15.1/en/main_classes/model#transformers.PreTrainedModel). Check the superclass documentation for the generic methods the

During inference, num_recycles should be set to the highest value that the model was trained with for maximum accuracy. Accordingly, when this value is set to `None`, config.max_recycles is used.

output_hidden_states (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`) : Whether or not to return the hidden states of all layers. See `hidden_states` under returned tensors for more detail.

- **plddt** (`torch.FloatTensor`, *optional*) -- Per-residue confidence scores. Regions of low confidence may indicate areas where the model's prediction is
  uncertain, or where the protein structure is disordered.
