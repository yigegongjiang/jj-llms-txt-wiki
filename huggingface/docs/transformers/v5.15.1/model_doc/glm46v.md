# GLM-4.6V

## Overview

The GLM-V model was proposed in [GLM-4.5V and GLM-4.1V-Thinking: Towards Versatile Multimodal Reasoning with Scalable Reinforcement Learning](https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.01006v6).

The abstract from the paper is the following:

> *We present GLM-4.1V-Thinking, GLM-4.5V, and GLM-4.6V, a family of vision-language models (VLMs) designed to advance
general-purpose multimodal understanding and reasoning. In this report, we share our key findings in the development of
the reasoning-centric training framework. We first develop a capable vision foundation model with significant potential
through large-scale pre-training, which arguably sets the upper bound for the final performance. We then propose
Reinforcement Learning with Curriculum Sampling (RLCS) to unlock the full potential of the model, leading to
comprehensive capability enhancement across a diverse range of tasks, including STEM problem solving, video
understanding, content recognition, coding, grounding, GUI-based agents, and long document interpretation. In a
comprehensive evaluation across 42 public benchmarks, GLM-4.5V achieves state-of-the-art performance on nearly all tasks
among open-source models of similar size, and demonstrates competitive or even superior results compared to
closed-source models such as Gemini-2.5-Flash on challenging tasks including Coding and GUI Agents. Meanwhile, the
smaller GLM-4.1V-9B-Thinking remains highly competitive-achieving superior results to the much larger Qwen2.5-VL-72B on
29 benchmarks. We open-source both GLM-4.1V-9B-Thinking and GLM-4.5V. We further introduce the GLM-4.6V series,
open-source multimodal models with native tool use and a 128K context window. A brief overview is available at this
https URL. Code, models and more information are released at https://github.com/zai-org/GLM-V*

This is the configuration class to store the configuration of a Glm46VModel. It is used to instantiate a Glm46V
model according to the specified arguments, defining the model architecture. Instantiating a configuration with the
defaults will yield a similar configuration to that of the [zai-org/GLM-4.1V-9B-Thinking](https://huggingface.co/zai-org/GLM-4.1V-9B-Thinking)

Configuration objects inherit from [PreTrainedConfig](/docs/transformers/v5.15.1/en/main_classes/configuration#transformers.PreTrainedConfig) and can be used to control the model outputs. Read the
documentation from [PreTrainedConfig](/docs/transformers/v5.15.1/en/main_classes/configuration#transformers.PreTrainedConfig) for more information.

```python
>>> from transformers import Glm46VForConditionalGeneration, Glm46VConfig

>>> # Initializing a GLM-4.6V style configuration
>>> configuration = Glm46VConfig()

>>> # Initializing a model from the GLM-4.6V style configuration
>>> model = Glm4vForConditionalGeneration(configuration)

Indices can be obtained using [AutoTokenizer](/docs/transformers/v5.15.1/en/model_doc/auto#transformers.AutoTokenizer). See [PreTrainedTokenizer.encode()](/docs/transformers/v5.15.1/en/internal/tokenization_utils#transformers.PreTrainedTokenizerBase.encode) and [PreTrainedTokenizer.__call__()](/docs/transformers/v5.15.1/en/internal/tokenization_utils#transformers.PreTrainedTokenizerBase.__call__) for details.  [What are input IDs?](../glossary#input-ids)

attention_mask (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, *optional*) : Mask to avoid performing attention on padding token indices. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:  - 1 for tokens that are **not masked**, - 0 for tokens that are **masked**.  [What are attention masks?](../glossary#attention-mask)

Only [Cache](/docs/transformers/v5.15.1/en/internal/generation_utils#transformers.Cache) instance is allowed as input, see our [kv cache guide](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/kv_cache). If no `past_key_values` are passed, [DynamicCache](/docs/transformers/v5.15.1/en/internal/generation_utils#transformers.DynamicCache) will be initialized by default.  The model will output the same cache format that is fed as input.  If `past_key_values` are used, the user is expected to input only unprocessed `input_ids` (those that don't have their past key value states given to this model) of shape `(batch_size, unprocessed_length)` instead of all `input_ids` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`.

Pixel values can be obtained using `image_processor_class`. See `image_processor_class.__call__` for details (`processor_class` uses `image_processor_class` for processing images).

Multimodal token type ids can be obtained using [AutoProcessor](/docs/transformers/v5.15.1/en/model_doc/auto#transformers.AutoProcessor). See [ProcessorMixin.__call__()](/docs/transformers/v5.15.1/en/main_classes/processors#transformers.ProcessorMixin.__call__) for details.

#### get_image_features[[transformers.Glm46VForConditionalGeneration.get_image_features]]

```python
get_image_features(pixel_values: FloatTensor, image_grid_thw: typing.Optional[torch.LongTensor] = None, **kwargs: Unpack)
```

[Source](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/v5.15.1/src/transformers/models/glm46v/modeling_glm46v.py#L469)

**Parameters:**

pixel_values (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, num_channels, image_size, image_size)`) : The tensors corresponding to the input images.

image_grid_thw (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(num_images, 3)`, *optional*) : The temporal, height and width of feature shape of each image in LLM.

**Returns:** [BaseModelOutputWithPooling](/docs/transformers/v5.15.1/en/main_classes/output#transformers.modeling_outputs.BaseModelOutputWithPooling) or `tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`

A [BaseModelOutputWithPooling](/docs/transformers/v5.15.1/en/main_classes/output#transformers.modeling_outputs.BaseModelOutputWithPooling) or a tuple of
`torch.FloatTensor` (if `return_dict=False` is passed or when `config.return_dict=False`) comprising various
elements depending on the configuration ([Glm46VConfig](/docs/transformers/v5.15.1/en/model_doc/glm46v#transformers.Glm46VConfig)) and inputs.

- **last_hidden_state** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`) -- Sequence of hidden-states at the output of the last layer of the model.
- **pooler_output** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, hidden_size)`) -- Last layer hidden-state of the first token of the sequence (classification token) after further processing
  through the layers used for the auxiliary pretraining task. E.g. for BERT-family of models, this returns
  the classification token after processing through a linear layer and a tanh activation function. The linear
  layer weights are trained from the next sentence prediction (classification) objective during pretraining.
- **hidden_states** (`tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`, *optional*, returned when `output_hidden_states=True` is passed or when `config.output_hidden_states=True`) -- Tuple of `torch.FloatTensor` (one for the output of the embeddings, if the model has an embedding layer, +
  one for the output of each layer) of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`.

  Hidden-states of the model at the output of each layer plus the optional initial embedding outputs.
- **attentions** (`tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`, *optional*, returned when `output_attentions=True` is passed or when `config.output_attentions=True`) -- Tuple of `torch.FloatTensor` (one for each layer) of shape `(batch_size, num_heads, sequence_length,
  sequence_length)`.

  Attentions weights after the attention softmax, used to compute the weighted average in the self-attention
  heads.

Example:

```python
>>> from PIL import Image
>>> from transformers import AutoProcessor, Glm46VForConditionalGeneration

>>> model = Glm46VForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained("zai-org/GLM-4.1V-9B-Thinking")
>>> processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained("zai-org/GLM-4.1V-9B-Thinking")

>>> messages = [

...             {"type": "image", "url": "https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/pipeline-cat-chonk.jpeg"},
...             {"type": "text", "text": "Where is the cat standing?"},
...         ]
...     },
... ]

>>> inputs = processor.apply_chat_template(
...     messages,
...     tokenize=True,
...     return_dict=True,
...     return_tensors="pt",

>>> # Generate
