# vLLM

[vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm) is a high-throughput inference engine for serving LLMs at scale. It continuously batches requests and keeps KV cache memory compact with PagedAttention.

Set `model_impl="transformers"` to load a model using the Transformers modeling backend.

```py
from vllm import LLM

llm = LLM(model="meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B", model_impl="transformers")
print(llm.generate(["The capital of France is"]))
```

Pass `--model-impl transformers` to the `vllm serve` command for online serving.

```bash
vllm serve meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B \
    --task generate \
    --model-impl transformers
```

## Transformers integration

1. [AutoConfig.from_pretrained()](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/model_doc/auto#transformers.AutoConfig.from_pretrained) loads the model's `config.json` from the Hub or your Hugging Face cache. vLLM checks the `architectures` field against its internal model registry to determine which vLLM model class to use.
2. If the model isn't in the registry, vLLM calls [AutoModel.from_config()](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/model_doc/auto#transformers.AutoModel.from_config) to load the Transformers model implementation instead.
3. [AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained()](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/model_doc/auto#transformers.AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained) loads the tokenizer files. vLLM caches some tokenizer internals to reduce overhead during inference.
4. Model weights download from the Hub in safetensors format.

Setting `model_impl="transformers"` bypasses the vLLM model registry and loads directly from Transformers. vLLM replaces most model modules (MoE, attention, linear layers) with its own optimized versions while keeping the Transformers model structure.
