# Longformer

[Longformer](https://huggingface.co/papers/2004.05150) is a transformer model designed for processing long documents. The self-attention operation usually scales quadratically with sequence length, preventing transformers from processing longer sequences. The Longformer attention mechanism overcomes this by scaling linearly with sequence length. It combines local windowed attention with task-specific global attention, enabling efficient processing of documents with thousands of tokens.

You can find all the original Longformer checkpoints under the [Ai2](https://huggingface.co/allenai?search_models=longformer) organization.

## Notes

- Longformer is based on [RoBERTa](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/model_doc/roberta) and doesn't have `token_type_ids`. You don't need to indicate which token belongs to which segment. You only need to separate the segments with the separation token `</s>` or `tokenizer.sep_token`.
- You can set which tokens can attend locally and which tokens attend globally with the `global_attention_mask` at inference (see this [example](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/model_doc/longformer#transformers.LongformerModel.forward.example) for more details). A value of `0` means a token attends locally and a value of `1` means a token attends globally.
- [LongformerForMaskedLM](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/model_doc/longformer#transformers.LongformerForMaskedLM) is trained like [RobertaForMaskedLM](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/model_doc/roberta#transformers.RobertaForMaskedLM) and should be used as shown below.

  ```py
    input_ids = tokenizer.encode("This is a sentence from [MASK] training data", return_tensors="pt").to(model.device)
    mlm_labels = tokenizer.encode("This is a sentence from the training data", return_tensors="pt").to(model.device)
    loss = model(input_ids, labels=input_ids, masked_lm_labels=mlm_labels)[0]
    ```

This is the configuration class to store the configuration of a LongformerModel. It is used to instantiate a Longformer
model according to the specified arguments, defining the model architecture. Instantiating a configuration with the
defaults will yield a similar configuration to that of the [allenai/longformer-base-4096](https://huggingface.co/allenai/longformer-base-4096)

Configuration objects inherit from [PreTrainedConfig](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/main_classes/configuration#transformers.PreTrainedConfig) and can be used to control the model outputs. Read the
documentation from [PreTrainedConfig](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/main_classes/configuration#transformers.PreTrainedConfig) for more information.

Example:

```python
>>> from transformers import LongformerConfig, LongformerModel

>>> # Initializing a Longformer configuration
>>> configuration = LongformerConfig()

>>> # Initializing a model from the configuration
>>> model = LongformerModel(configuration)

>>> # Accessing the model configuration
>>> configuration = model.config
```

  When building a sequence using special tokens, this is not the token that is used for the beginning of
  sequence. The token used is the `cls_token`.

  When building a sequence using special tokens, this is not the token that is used for the end of sequence.

- **sep_token** (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"</s>"`) --
  The separator token, which is used when building a sequence from multiple sequences, e.g. two sequences for
  sequence classification or for a text and a question for question answering. It is also used as the last
  token of a sequence built with special tokens.
- **cls_token** (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"<s>"`) --
  The classifier token which is used when doing sequence classification (classification of the whole sequence
  instead of per-token classification). It is the first token of the sequence when built with special tokens.

  token instead.

  Whether the post processing step should trim offsets to avoid including whitespaces.

Construct a RoBERTa tokenizer (backed by HuggingFace's tokenizers library). Based on Byte-Pair-Encoding.

This tokenizer has been trained to treat spaces like parts of the tokens (a bit like sentencepiece) so a word will

be encoded differently whether it is at the beginning of the sentence (without space) or not:

```python
>>> from transformers import RobertaTokenizer

>>> tokenizer = RobertaTokenizer.from_pretrained("FacebookAI/roberta-base")
>>> tokenizer("Hello world")["input_ids"]
[0, 31414, 232, 2]

>>> tokenizer(" Hello world")["input_ids"]
[0, 20920, 232, 2]
```

You can get around that behavior by passing `add_prefix_space=True` when instantiating this tokenizer or when you
call it on some text, but since the model was not pretrained this way, it might yield a decrease in performance.

When used with `is_split_into_words=True`, this tokenizer needs to be instantiated with `add_prefix_space=True`.

This tokenizer inherits from [TokenizersBackend](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/main_classes/tokenizer#transformers.TokenizersBackend) which contains most of the main methods. Users should refer to
this superclass for more information regarding those methods.

- **labels** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size,)`, *optional*) --
  Labels for computing the sequence classification/regression loss. Indices should be in `[0, ...,

  Local attentions weights after the attention softmax, used to compute the weighted average in the
  self-attention heads. Those are the attention weights from every token in the sequence to every token with
  global attention (first `x` values) and to every token in the attention window (remaining `attention_window
  + 1` values). Note that the first `x` values refer to tokens with fixed positions in the text, but the
  remaining `attention_window + 1` values refer to tokens with relative positions: the attention weight of a
  token to itself is located at index `x + attention_window / 2` and the `attention_window / 2` preceding
  (succeeding) values are the attention weights to the `attention_window / 2` preceding (succeeding) tokens.
  If the attention window contains a token with global attention, the attention weight at the corresponding
  index is set to 0; the value should be accessed from the first `x` attention weights. If a token has global
  attention, the attention weights to all other tokens in `attentions` is set to 0, the values should be

- **attention_mask** (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, *optional*) --
  Mask to avoid performing attention on padding token indices. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:

  - 1 for tokens that are **not masked**,
  - 0 for tokens that are **masked**.

  [What are attention masks?](../glossary#attention-mask)
- **global_attention_mask** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, *optional*) --
  Mask to decide the attention given on each token, local attention or global attention. Tokens with global
  attention attends to all other tokens, and all other tokens attend to them. This is important for
  task-specific finetuning because it makes the model more flexible at representing the task. For example,
  for classification, the  token should be given global attention. For QA, all question tokens should also
  have global attention. Please refer to the [Longformer paper](https://huggingface.co/papers/2004.05150) for more
  details. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:

  - 0 for local attention (a sliding window attention),
  - 1 for global attention (tokens that attend to all other tokens, and all other tokens attend to them).
- **token_type_ids** (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, *optional*) --
  Segment token indices to indicate first and second portions of the inputs. Indices are selected in `[0, 1]`:

  - 0 corresponds to a *sentence A* token,
  - 1 corresponds to a *sentence B* token.

  [What are token type IDs?](../glossary#token-type-ids)
- **position_ids** (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, *optional*) --
  Indices of positions of each input sequence tokens in the position embeddings. Selected in the range `[0, config.n_positions - 1]`.

  [What are position IDs?](../glossary#position-ids)
- **inputs_embeds** (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`, *optional*) --
  Optionally, instead of passing `input_ids` you can choose to directly pass an embedded representation. This
  is useful if you want more control over how to convert `input_ids` indices into associated vectors than the
  model's internal embedding lookup matrix.
- **start_positions** (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(batch_size,)`, *optional*) --
  Labels for position (index) of the start of the labelled span for computing the token classification loss.
  Positions are clamped to the length of the sequence (`sequence_length`). Position outside of the sequence
  are not taken into account for computing the loss.
- **end_positions** (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(batch_size,)`, *optional*) --
  Labels for position (index) of the end of the labelled span for computing the token classification loss.
  Positions are clamped to the length of the sequence (`sequence_length`). Position outside of the sequence
  are not taken into account for computing the loss.
- **output_attentions** (`bool`, *optional*) --
  Whether or not to return the attentions tensors of all attention layers. See `attentions` under returned
  tensors for more detail.
- **output_hidden_states** (`bool`, *optional*) --
  Whether or not to return the hidden states of all layers. See `hidden_states` under returned tensors for
  more detail.
- **return_dict** (`bool`, *optional*) --
  Whether or not to return a [ModelOutput](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/main_classes/output#transformers.utils.ModelOutput) instead of a plain tuple.[LongformerQuestionAnsweringModelOutput](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/model_doc/longformer#transformers.models.longformer.modeling_longformer.LongformerQuestionAnsweringModelOutput) or `tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`A [LongformerQuestionAnsweringModelOutput](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/model_doc/longformer#transformers.models.longformer.modeling_longformer.LongformerQuestionAnsweringModelOutput) or a tuple of
`torch.FloatTensor` (if `return_dict=False` is passed or when `config.return_dict=False`) comprising various
elements depending on the configuration ([LongformerConfig](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/model_doc/longformer#transformers.LongformerConfig)) and inputs.
The [LongformerForQuestionAnswering](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/model_doc/longformer#transformers.LongformerForQuestionAnswering) forward method, overrides the `__call__` special method.

Although the recipe for forward pass needs to be defined within this function, one should call the `Module`
instance afterwards instead of this since the former takes care of running the pre and post processing steps while
the latter silently ignores them.

- **loss** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(1,)`, *optional*, returned when `labels` is provided) -- Total span extraction loss is the sum of a Cross-Entropy for the start and end positions.
- **start_logits** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, *optional*) -- Span-start scores (before SoftMax).
- **end_logits** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, *optional*) -- Span-end scores (before SoftMax).
- **hidden_states** (`tuple[torch.FloatTensor, ...]`, *optional*, returned when `output_hidden_states=True` is passed or when `config.output_hidden_states=True`) -- Tuple of `torch.FloatTensor` (one for the output of the embeddings, if the model has an embedding layer, +
  one for the output of each layer) of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`.

  Hidden-states of the model at the output of each layer plus the optional initial embedding outputs.
- **attentions** (`tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`, *optional*, returned when `output_attentions=True` is passed or when `config.output_attentions=True`) -- Tuple of `torch.FloatTensor` (one for each layer) of shape `(batch_size, num_heads, sequence_length, x +
  attention_window + 1)`, where `x` is the number of tokens with global attention mask.

  Local attentions weights after the attention softmax, used to compute the weighted average in the
  self-attention heads. Those are the attention weights from every token in the sequence to every token with
  global attention (first `x` values) and to every token in the attention window (remaining `attention_window
  + 1` values). Note that the first `x` values refer to tokens with fixed positions in the text, but the
  remaining `attention_window + 1` values refer to tokens with relative positions: the attention weight of a
  token to itself is located at index `x + attention_window / 2` and the `attention_window / 2` preceding
  (succeeding) values are the attention weights to the `attention_window / 2` preceding (succeeding) tokens.
  If the attention window contains a token with global attention, the attention weight at the corresponding
  index is set to 0; the value should be accessed from the first `x` attention weights. If a token has global
  attention, the attention weights to all other tokens in `attentions` is set to 0, the values should be
  accessed from `global_attentions`.
- **global_attentions** (`tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`, *optional*, returned when `output_attentions=True` is passed or when `config.output_attentions=True`) -- Tuple of `torch.FloatTensor` (one for each layer) of shape `(batch_size, num_heads, sequence_length, x)`,
  where `x` is the number of tokens with global attention mask.

  Global attentions weights after the attention softmax, used to compute the weighted average in the
  self-attention heads. Those are the attention weights from every token with global attention to every token
  in the sequence.

Examples:

```python
>>> from transformers import AutoTokenizer, LongformerForQuestionAnswering
>>> import torch

>>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("allenai/longformer-large-4096-finetuned-triviaqa")
>>> model = LongformerForQuestionAnswering.from_pretrained("allenai/longformer-large-4096-finetuned-triviaqa")

>>> question, text = "Who was Jim Henson?", "Jim Henson was a nice puppet"
>>> encoding = tokenizer(question, text, return_tensors="pt")
>>> input_ids = encoding["input_ids"]

>>> # default is local attention everywhere
>>> # the forward method will automatically set global attention on question tokens
>>> attention_mask = encoding["attention_mask"]

>>> outputs = model(input_ids, attention_mask=attention_mask)
>>> start_logits = outputs.start_logits
>>> end_logits = outputs.end_logits
>>> all_tokens = tokenizer.convert_ids_to_tokens(input_ids[0].tolist())

>>> answer_tokens = all_tokens[torch.argmax(start_logits) : torch.argmax(end_logits) + 1]
>>> answer = tokenizer.decode(
...     tokenizer.convert_tokens_to_ids(answer_tokens)
... )  # remove space prepending space token
