# Time Series Transformer

## Overview

The Time Series Transformer model is a vanilla encoder-decoder Transformer for time series forecasting.
This model was contributed by [kashif](https://huggingface.co/kashif).

## Usage tips

- Similar to other models in the library, [TimeSeriesTransformerModel](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/model_doc/time_series_transformer#transformers.TimeSeriesTransformerModel) is the raw Transformer without any head on top, and [TimeSeriesTransformerForPrediction](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/model_doc/time_series_transformer#transformers.TimeSeriesTransformerForPrediction)
adds a distribution head on top of the former, which can be used for time-series forecasting. Note that this is a so-called probabilistic forecasting model, not a
point forecasting model. This means that the model learns a distribution, from which one can sample. The model doesn't directly output values.
- [TimeSeriesTransformerForPrediction](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/model_doc/time_series_transformer#transformers.TimeSeriesTransformerForPrediction) consists of 2 blocks: an encoder, which takes a `context_length` of time series values as input (called `past_values`),
and a decoder, which predicts a `prediction_length` of time series values into the future (called `future_values`). During training, one needs to provide
pairs of (`past_values` and `future_values`) to the model.
- In addition to the raw (`past_values` and `future_values`), one typically provides additional features to the model. These can be the following:
  - `past_time_features`: temporal features which the model will add to `past_values`. These serve as "positional encodings" for the Transformer encoder.
    Examples are "day of the month", "month of the year", etc. as scalar values (and then stacked together as a vector).
    e.g. if a given time-series value was obtained on the 11th of August, then one could have [11, 8] as time feature vector (11 being "day of the month", 8 being "month of the year").
  - `future_time_features`: temporal features which the model will add to `future_values`. These serve as "positional encodings" for the Transformer decoder.
    Examples are "day of the month", "month of the year", etc. as scalar values (and then stacked together as a vector).
    e.g. if a given time-series value was obtained on the 11th of August, then one could have [11, 8] as time feature vector (11 being "day of the month", 8 being "month of the year").
  - `static_categorical_features`: categorical features which are static over time (i.e., have the same value for all `past_values` and `future_values`).
    An example here is the store ID or region ID that identifies a given time-series.
    Note that these features need to be known for ALL data points (also those in the future).
  - `static_real_features`: real-valued features which are static over time (i.e., have the same value for all `past_values` and `future_values`).
    An example here is the image representation of the product for which you have the time-series values (like the [ResNet](resnet) embedding of a "shoe" picture,
    if your time-series is about the sales of shoes).
    Note that these features need to be known for ALL data points (also those in the future).
- The model is trained using "teacher-forcing", similar to how a Transformer is trained for machine translation. This means that, during training, one shifts the
`future_values` one position to the right as input to the decoder, prepended by the last value of `past_values`. At each time step, the model needs to predict the
next target. So the set-up of training is similar to a GPT model for language, except that there's no notion of `decoder_start_token_id` (we just use the last value
of the context as initial input for the decoder).
- At inference time, we give the final value of the `past_values` as input to the decoder. Next, we can sample from the model to make a prediction at the next time step,
which is then fed to the decoder in order to make the next prediction (also called autoregressive generation).

This is the configuration class to store the configuration of a TimeSeriesTransformerModel. It is used to instantiate a Time Series Transformer
model according to the specified arguments, defining the model architecture. Instantiating a configuration with the
defaults will yield a similar configuration to that of the [huggingface/time-series-transformer-tourism-monthly](https://huggingface.co/huggingface/time-series-transformer-tourism-monthly)

Configuration objects inherit from [PreTrainedConfig](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/main_classes/configuration#transformers.PreTrainedConfig) and can be used to control the model outputs. Read the
documentation from [PreTrainedConfig](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/main_classes/configuration#transformers.PreTrainedConfig) for more information.

Example:

```python
>>> from transformers import TimeSeriesTransformerConfig, TimeSeriesTransformerModel

>>> # Initializing a Time Series Transformer configuration with 12 time steps for prediction
>>> configuration = TimeSeriesTransformerConfig(prediction_length=12)

>>> # Randomly initializing a model (with random weights) from the configuration
>>> model = TimeSeriesTransformerModel(configuration)

>>> # Accessing the model configuration
>>> configuration = model.config
```

## TimeSeriesTransformerModel[[transformers.TimeSeriesTransformerModel]]

- **config** ([TimeSeriesTransformerConfig](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/model_doc/time_series_transformer#transformers.TimeSeriesTransformerConfig)) --
  Model configuration class with all the parameters of the model. Initializing with a config file does not
  load the weights associated with the model, only the configuration. Check out the
  [from_pretrained()](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/main_classes/model#transformers.PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained) method to load the model weights.

etc.)

- **past_values** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)` or `(batch_size, sequence_length, input_size)`) --
  Past values of the time series, that serve as context in order to predict the future. The sequence size of
  this tensor must be larger than the `context_length` of the model, since the model will use the larger size
  to construct lag features, i.e. additional values from the past which are added in order to serve as "extra
  context".

  The `sequence_length` here is equal to `config.context_length` + `max(config.lags_sequence)`, which if no
  `lags_sequence` is configured, is equal to `config.context_length` + 7 (as by default, the largest
  look-back index in `config.lags_sequence` is 7). The property `_past_length` returns the actual length of
  the past.

  The `past_values` is what the Transformer encoder gets as input (with optional additional features, such as
  `static_categorical_features`, `static_real_features`, `past_time_features` and lags).

  Optionally, missing values need to be replaced with zeros and indicated via the `past_observed_mask`.

  For multivariate time series, the `input_size` > 1 dimension is required and corresponds to the number of
  variates in the time series per time step.
- **past_time_features** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, num_features)`) --
  Required time features, which the model internally will add to `past_values`. These could be things like
  "month of year", "day of the month", etc. encoded as vectors (for instance as Fourier features). These
  could also be so-called "age" features, which basically help the model know "at which point in life" a
  time-series is. Age features have small values for distant past time steps and increase monotonically the
  more we approach the current time step. Holiday features are also a good example of time features.

  These features serve as the "positional encodings" of the inputs. So contrary to a model like BERT, where
  the position encodings are learned from scratch internally as parameters of the model, the Time Series
  Transformer requires to provide additional time features. The Time Series Transformer only learns
  additional embeddings for `static_categorical_features`.

  Additional dynamic real covariates can be concatenated to this tensor, with the caveat that these features
  must but known at prediction time.

  The `num_features` here is equal to `config.`num_time_features` + `config.num_dynamic_real_features`.
- **past_observed_mask** (`torch.BoolTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)` or `(batch_size, sequence_length, input_size)`, *optional*) --
  Boolean mask to indicate which `past_values` were observed and which were missing. Mask values selected in
  `[0, 1]`:

  - 1 for values that are **observed**,
  - 0 for values that are **missing** (i.e. NaNs that were replaced by zeros).
- **static_categorical_features** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, number of static categorical features)`, *optional*) --
  Optional static categorical features for which the model will learn an embedding, which it will add to the
  values of the time series.

  Static categorical features are features which have the same value for all time steps (static over time).

  A typical example of a static categorical feature is a time series ID.
- **static_real_features** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, number of static real features)`, *optional*) --
  Optional static real features which the model will add to the values of the time series.

  Static real features are features which have the same value for all time steps (static over time).

  A typical example of a static real feature is promotion information.
- **future_values** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, prediction_length)` or `(batch_size, prediction_length, input_size)`, *optional*) --
  Future values of the time series, that serve as labels for the model. The `future_values` is what the
  Transformer needs during training to learn to output, given the `past_values`.

  The sequence length here is equal to `prediction_length`.

  See the demo notebook and code snippets for details.

  Optionally, during training any missing values need to be replaced with zeros and indicated via the
  `future_observed_mask`.

  For multivariate time series, the `input_size` > 1 dimension is required and corresponds to the number of
  variates in the time series per time step.
- **future_time_features** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, prediction_length, num_features)`) --
  Required time features for the prediction window, which the model internally will add to `future_values`.
  These could be things like "month of year", "day of the month", etc. encoded as vectors (for instance as
  Fourier features). These could also be so-called "age" features, which basically help the model know "at
  which point in life" a time-series is. Age features have small values for distant past time steps and
  increase monotonically the more we approach the current time step. Holiday features are also a good example
  of time features.

  These features serve as the "positional encodings" of the inputs. So contrary to a model like BERT, where
  the position encodings are learned from scratch internally as parameters of the model, the Time Series
  Transformer requires to provide additional time features. The Time Series Transformer only learns
  additional embeddings for `static_categorical_features`.

  Additional dynamic real covariates can be concatenated to this tensor, with the caveat that these features
  must but known at prediction time.

  The `num_features` here is equal to `config.`num_time_features` + `config.num_dynamic_real_features`.
- **decoder_attention_mask** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, target_sequence_length)`, *optional*) --
  Mask to avoid performing attention on certain token indices. By default, a causal mask will be used, to
  make sure the model can only look at previous inputs in order to predict the future.
- **encoder_outputs** (`tuple(tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`, *optional*) --
  Tuple consists of `last_hidden_state`, `hidden_states` (*optional*) and `attentions` (*optional*)
  `last_hidden_state` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)` (*optional*) is a sequence of
  hidden-states at the output of the last layer of the encoder. Used in the cross-attention of the decoder.
- **past_key_values** (`~cache_utils.Cache`, *optional*) --
  Pre-computed hidden-states (key and values in the self-attention blocks and in the cross-attention
  blocks) that can be used to speed up sequential decoding. This typically consists in the `past_key_values`
  returned by the model at a previous stage of decoding, when `use_cache=True` or `config.use_cache=True`.

  Only [Cache](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/internal/generation_utils#transformers.Cache) instance is allowed as input, see our [kv cache guide](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/kv_cache).
  If no `past_key_values` are passed, [DynamicCache](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/internal/generation_utils#transformers.DynamicCache) will be initialized by default.

  The model will output the same cache format that is fed as input.

  If `past_key_values` are used, the user is expected to input only unprocessed `input_ids` (those that don't
  have their past key value states given to this model) of shape `(batch_size, unprocessed_length)` instead of all `input_ids`
  of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`.
- **use_cache** (`bool`, *optional*) --
  If set to `True`, `past_key_values` key value states are returned and can be used to speed up decoding (see
  `past_key_values`).[Seq2SeqTSModelOutput](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/main_classes/output#transformers.modeling_outputs.Seq2SeqTSModelOutput) or `tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`A [Seq2SeqTSModelOutput](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/main_classes/output#transformers.modeling_outputs.Seq2SeqTSModelOutput) or a tuple of
`torch.FloatTensor` (if `return_dict=False` is passed or when `config.return_dict=False`) comprising various
elements depending on the configuration ([TimeSeriesTransformerConfig](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/model_doc/time_series_transformer#transformers.TimeSeriesTransformerConfig)) and inputs.
The [TimeSeriesTransformerModel](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/model_doc/time_series_transformer#transformers.TimeSeriesTransformerModel) forward method, overrides the `__call__` special method.

Although the recipe for forward pass needs to be defined within this function, one should call the `Module`
instance afterwards instead of this since the former takes care of running the pre and post processing steps while
the latter silently ignores them.

- **last_hidden_state** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`) -- Sequence of hidden-states at the output of the last layer of the decoder of the model.

  If `past_key_values` is used only the last hidden-state of the sequences of shape `(batch_size, 1,
  hidden_size)` is output.
- **past_key_values** (`EncoderDecoderCache`, *optional*, returned when `use_cache=True` is passed or when `config.use_cache=True`) -- It is a [EncoderDecoderCache](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/internal/generation_utils#transformers.EncoderDecoderCache) instance. For more details, see our [kv cache guide](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/kv_cache).

  Contains pre-computed hidden-states (key and values in the self-attention blocks and in the cross-attention
  blocks) that can be used (see `past_key_values` input) to speed up sequential decoding.

  sequence_length)`.

  self-attention heads.
- **cross_attentions** (`tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`, *optional*, returned when `output_attentions=True` is passed or when `config.output_attentions=True`) -- Tuple of `torch.FloatTensor` (one for each layer) of shape `(batch_size, num_heads, sequence_length,
  sequence_length)`.

  For multivariate time series, the `input_size` > 1 dimension is required and corresponds to the number of
  variates in the time series per time step.
- **past_time_features** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, num_features)`) --
  Required time features, which the model internally will add to `past_values`. These could be things like
  "month of year", "day of the month", etc. encoded as vectors (for instance as Fourier features). These
  could also be so-called "age" features, which basically help the model know "at which point in life" a
  time-series is. Age features have small values for distant past time steps and increase monotonically the
  more we approach the current time step. Holiday features are also a good example of time features.

  These features serve as the "positional encodings" of the inputs. So contrary to a model like BERT, where
  the position encodings are learned from scratch internally as parameters of the model, the Time Series
  Transformer requires to provide additional time features. The Time Series Transformer only learns
  additional embeddings for `static_categorical_features`.

  Additional dynamic real covariates can be concatenated to this tensor, with the caveat that these features
  must but known at prediction time.

  The `num_features` here is equal to `config.`num_time_features` + `config.num_dynamic_real_features`.
- **past_observed_mask** (`torch.BoolTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)` or `(batch_size, sequence_length, input_size)`, *optional*) --
  Boolean mask to indicate which `past_values` were observed and which were missing. Mask values selected in
  `[0, 1]`:

  - 1 for values that are **observed**,
  - 0 for values that are **missing** (i.e. NaNs that were replaced by zeros).
- **static_categorical_features** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, number of static categorical features)`, *optional*) --
  Optional static categorical features for which the model will learn an embedding, which it will add to the
  values of the time series.

  Static categorical features are features which have the same value for all time steps (static over time).

  A typical example of a static categorical feature is a time series ID.
- **static_real_features** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, number of static real features)`, *optional*) --
  Optional static real features which the model will add to the values of the time series.

  Static real features are features which have the same value for all time steps (static over time).

  A typical example of a static real feature is promotion information.
- **future_values** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, prediction_length)` or `(batch_size, prediction_length, input_size)`, *optional*) --
  Future values of the time series, that serve as labels for the model. The `future_values` is what the
  Transformer needs during training to learn to output, given the `past_values`.

  The sequence length here is equal to `prediction_length`.

  See the demo notebook and code snippets for details.

  Optionally, during training any missing values need to be replaced with zeros and indicated via the
  `future_observed_mask`.

  For multivariate time series, the `input_size` > 1 dimension is required and corresponds to the number of
  variates in the time series per time step.
- **future_time_features** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, prediction_length, num_features)`) --
  Required time features for the prediction window, which the model internally will add to `future_values`.
  These could be things like "month of year", "day of the month", etc. encoded as vectors (for instance as
  Fourier features). These could also be so-called "age" features, which basically help the model know "at
  which point in life" a time-series is. Age features have small values for distant past time steps and
  increase monotonically the more we approach the current time step. Holiday features are also a good example
  of time features.

  These features serve as the "positional encodings" of the inputs. So contrary to a model like BERT, where
  the position encodings are learned from scratch internally as parameters of the model, the Time Series
  Transformer requires to provide additional time features. The Time Series Transformer only learns
  additional embeddings for `static_categorical_features`.

  Additional dynamic real covariates can be concatenated to this tensor, with the caveat that these features
  must but known at prediction time.

  The `num_features` here is equal to `config.`num_time_features` + `config.num_dynamic_real_features`.
- **future_observed_mask** (`torch.BoolTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)` or `(batch_size, sequence_length, input_size)`, *optional*) --
  Boolean mask to indicate which `future_values` were observed and which were missing. Mask values selected
  in `[0, 1]`:

  - 1 for values that are **observed**,
  - 0 for values that are **missing** (i.e. NaNs that were replaced by zeros).

  This mask is used to filter out missing values for the final loss calculation.
- **decoder_attention_mask** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, target_sequence_length)`, *optional*) --
  Mask to avoid performing attention on certain token indices. By default, a causal mask will be used, to
  make sure the model can only look at previous inputs in order to predict the future.
- **encoder_outputs** (`tuple(tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`, *optional*) --
  Tuple consists of `last_hidden_state`, `hidden_states` (*optional*) and `attentions` (*optional*)
  `last_hidden_state` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)` (*optional*) is a sequence of
  hidden-states at the output of the last layer of the encoder. Used in the cross-attention of the decoder.
- **past_key_values** (`~cache_utils.Cache`, *optional*) --
  Pre-computed hidden-states (key and values in the self-attention blocks and in the cross-attention
  blocks) that can be used to speed up sequential decoding. This typically consists in the `past_key_values`
  returned by the model at a previous stage of decoding, when `use_cache=True` or `config.use_cache=True`.

  Only [Cache](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/internal/generation_utils#transformers.Cache) instance is allowed as input, see our [kv cache guide](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/kv_cache).
  If no `past_key_values` are passed, [DynamicCache](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/internal/generation_utils#transformers.DynamicCache) will be initialized by default.

  The model will output the same cache format that is fed as input.

  If `past_key_values` are used, the user is expected to input only unprocessed `input_ids` (those that don't
  have their past key value states given to this model) of shape `(batch_size, unprocessed_length)` instead of all `input_ids`
  of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`.
- **use_cache** (`bool`, *optional*) --
  If set to `True`, `past_key_values` key value states are returned and can be used to speed up decoding (see
  `past_key_values`).[Seq2SeqTSModelOutput](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/main_classes/output#transformers.modeling_outputs.Seq2SeqTSModelOutput) or `tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`A [Seq2SeqTSModelOutput](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/main_classes/output#transformers.modeling_outputs.Seq2SeqTSModelOutput) or a tuple of
`torch.FloatTensor` (if `return_dict=False` is passed or when `config.return_dict=False`) comprising various
elements depending on the configuration ([TimeSeriesTransformerConfig](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/model_doc/time_series_transformer#transformers.TimeSeriesTransformerConfig)) and inputs.
The [TimeSeriesTransformerForPrediction](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/model_doc/time_series_transformer#transformers.TimeSeriesTransformerForPrediction) forward method, overrides the `__call__` special method.

Although the recipe for forward pass needs to be defined within this function, one should call the `Module`
instance afterwards instead of this since the former takes care of running the pre and post processing steps while
the latter silently ignores them.

- **last_hidden_state** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`) -- Sequence of hidden-states at the output of the last layer of the decoder of the model.

  If `past_key_values` is used only the last hidden-state of the sequences of shape `(batch_size, 1,
  hidden_size)` is output.
- **past_key_values** (`EncoderDecoderCache`, *optional*, returned when `use_cache=True` is passed or when `config.use_cache=True`) -- It is a [EncoderDecoderCache](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/internal/generation_utils#transformers.EncoderDecoderCache) instance. For more details, see our [kv cache guide](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/kv_cache).

  sequence_length)`.

  self-attention heads.

  sequence_length)`.
