# Fuyu

## Overview

The Fuyu model was created by [ADEPT](https://www.adept.ai/blog/fuyu-8b), and authored by Rohan Bavishi, Erich Elsen, Curtis Hawthorne, Maxwell Nye, Augustus Odena, Arushi Somani, Sağnak Taşırlar.

The authors introduced Fuyu-8B, a decoder-only multimodal model based on the classic transformers architecture, with query and key normalization. A linear encoder is added to create multimodal embeddings from image inputs.

By treating image tokens like text tokens and using a special image-newline character, the model knows when an image line ends. Image positional embeddings are removed. This avoids the need for different training phases for various image resolutions. With 8 billion parameters and licensed under CC-BY-NC, Fuyu-8B is notable for its ability to handle both text and images, its impressive context size of 16K, and its overall performance.

The `Fuyu` models were trained using `bfloat16`, but the original inference uses `float16` The checkpoints uploaded on the hub use `dtype = 'float16'` which will be
used by the `AutoModel` API to cast the checkpoints from `torch.float32` to `torch.float16`.

The `dtype` of the online weights is mostly irrelevant, unless you are using `dtype="auto"` when initializing a model using `model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("path", dtype = "auto")`. The reason is that the model will first be downloaded ( using the `dtype` of the checkpoints online) then it will be cast to the default `dtype` of `torch` (becomes `torch.float32`, device_map="auto"). Users should specify the `dtype` they want, and if they don't it will be `torch.float32`.

Finetuning the model in `float16` is not recommended and known to produce `nan`, as such the model should be fine-tuned in `bfloat16`.

Tips:

- To convert the model, you need to clone the original repository using `git clone https://github.com/persimmon-ai-labs/adept-inference`, then get the checkpoints:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/persimmon-ai-labs/adept-inference
wget path/to/fuyu-8b-model-weights.tar
tar -xvf fuyu-8b-model-weights.tar
python src/transformers/models/fuyu/convert_fuyu_weights_to_hf.py  --input_dir /path/to/downloaded/fuyu/weights/ --output_dir /output/path \
    --pt_model_path /path/to/fuyu_8b_release/iter_0001251/mp_rank_00/model_optim_rng.pt
    --ada_lib_path /path/to/adept-inference
```

For the chat model:

```bash
wget https://axtkn4xl5cip.objectstorage.us-phoenix-1.oci.customer-oci.com/n/axtkn4xl5cip/b/adept-public-data/o/8b_chat_model_release.tar
tar -xvf 8b_base_model_release.tar
```

Then, model can be loaded via:

```python
from transformers import FuyuConfig, FuyuForCausalLM

model_config = FuyuConfig()
model = FuyuForCausalLM(model_config).from_pretrained('/output/path')
```

Inputs need to be passed through a specific Processor to have the correct formats.
A processor requires an image_processor and a tokenizer. Hence, inputs can be loaded via:

```python
from PIL import Image

from transformers import AutoTokenizer
from transformers.models.fuyu.image_processing_fuyu import FuyuImageProcessor
from transformers.models.fuyu.processing_fuyu import FuyuProcessor

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained('adept-hf-collab/fuyu-8b')
image_processor = FuyuImageProcessor()

processor = FuyuProcessor(image_processor=image_processor, tokenizer=tokenizer)
text_prompt = "Generate a coco-style caption.\\n"

bus_image_url = "https://huggingface.co/datasets/hf-internal-testing/fixtures-captioning/resolve/main/bus.png"
bus_image_pil = Image.open(io.BytesIO(requests.get(bus_image_url).content))
inputs_to_model = processor(images=bus_image_pil, text=text_prompt)
```

This model was contributed by [Molbap](https://huggingface.co/Molbap).
The original code can be found [here](https://github.com/persimmon-ai-labs/adept-inference).

- Fuyu uses a `sentencepiece` based tokenizer, with a `Unigram` model. It supports bytefallback, which is only available in `tokenizers==0.14.0` for the fast tokenizer.
The `LlamaTokenizer` is used as it is a standard wrapper around sentencepiece.

- The authors suggest to use the following prompt for image captioning: `f"Generate a coco-style caption.\\n"`

This is the configuration class to store the configuration of a FuyuModel. It is used to instantiate a Fuyu
model according to the specified arguments, defining the model architecture. Instantiating a configuration with the
defaults will yield a similar configuration to that of the [adept/fuyu-8b](https://huggingface.co/adept/fuyu-8b)

Configuration objects inherit from [PreTrainedConfig](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/main_classes/configuration#transformers.PreTrainedConfig) and can be used to control the model outputs. Read the
documentation from [PreTrainedConfig](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/main_classes/configuration#transformers.PreTrainedConfig) for more information.

Example:

```python
>>> from transformers import FuyuConfig

>>> # Initializing a Fuyu fuyu-7b style configuration
>>> configuration = FuyuConfig()
```

## FuyuModel[[transformers.FuyuModel]]

- **config** ([FuyuConfig](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/model_doc/fuyu#transformers.FuyuConfig)) --
  Model configuration class with all the parameters of the model. Initializing with a config file does not
  load the weights associated with the model, only the configuration. Check out the
  [from_pretrained()](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/main_classes/model#transformers.PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained) method to load the model weights.

The Fuyu model which consists of a vision backbone and a language model, without a language modeling head.

This model inherits from [PreTrainedModel](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/main_classes/model#transformers.PreTrainedModel). Check the superclass documentation for the generic methods the
library implements for all its model (such as downloading or saving, resizing the input embeddings, pruning heads
etc.)

This model is also a PyTorch [torch.nn.Module](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module) subclass.
Use it as a regular PyTorch Module and refer to the PyTorch documentation for all matter related to general usage
and behavior.

- **input_ids** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, *optional*) --
  Indices of input sequence tokens in the vocabulary. Padding will be ignored by default.

  Indices can be obtained using [AutoTokenizer](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/model_doc/auto#transformers.AutoTokenizer). See [PreTrainedTokenizer.encode()](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/internal/tokenization_utils#transformers.PreTrainedTokenizerBase.encode) and
  [PreTrainedTokenizer.__call__()](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/internal/tokenization_utils#transformers.PreTrainedTokenizerBase.__call__) for details.

  [What are input IDs?](../glossary#input-ids)
- **image_patches** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, num_total_patches, patch_size_ x patch_size x num_channels)`, *optional*) --
  Image patches to be used as continuous embeddings. The patches are flattened and then projected to the
  hidden size of the model.
- **image_patches_indices** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, *optional*) --
  Tensor of indices of the image patches in the input_ids tensor.

- **past_key_values** (`~cache_utils.Cache`, *optional*) --
  Pre-computed hidden-states (key and values in the self-attention blocks and in the cross-attention
  blocks) that can be used to speed up sequential decoding. This typically consists in the `past_key_values`
  returned by the model at a previous stage of decoding, when `use_cache=True` or `config.use_cache=True`.

  Only [Cache](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/internal/generation_utils#transformers.Cache) instance is allowed as input, see our [kv cache guide](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/kv_cache).
  If no `past_key_values` are passed, [DynamicCache](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/internal/generation_utils#transformers.DynamicCache) will be initialized by default.

  The model will output the same cache format that is fed as input.

  If `past_key_values` are used, the user is expected to input only unprocessed `input_ids` (those that don't
  have their past key value states given to this model) of shape `(batch_size, unprocessed_length)` instead of all `input_ids`
  of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`.
- **inputs_embeds** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`, *optional*) --
  Optionally, instead of passing `input_ids` you can choose to directly pass an embedded representation. This
  is useful if you want more control over how to convert `input_ids` indices into associated vectors than the
  model's internal embedding lookup matrix.
- **use_cache** (`bool`, *optional*) --
  If set to `True`, `past_key_values` key value states are returned and can be used to speed up decoding (see
  `past_key_values`).[CausalLMOutputWithPast](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/main_classes/output#transformers.modeling_outputs.CausalLMOutputWithPast) or `tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`A [CausalLMOutputWithPast](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/main_classes/output#transformers.modeling_outputs.CausalLMOutputWithPast) or a tuple of
`torch.FloatTensor` (if `return_dict=False` is passed or when `config.return_dict=False`) comprising various

The [FuyuModel](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/model_doc/fuyu#transformers.FuyuModel) forward method, overrides the `__call__` special method.

Although the recipe for forward pass needs to be defined within this function, one should call the `Module`
instance afterwards instead of this since the former takes care of running the pre and post processing steps while
the latter silently ignores them.

  `past_key_values` input) to speed up sequential decoding.

- **tensor_type** (`Union[None, str, TensorType]`, *optional*) -- You can give a tensor_type here to convert the lists of integers in PyTorch/Numpy Tensors at
  initialization.

## FuyuImageProcessorPil[[transformers.FuyuImageProcessorPil]]

- **patch_size** (`dict[str, *kwargs*, int]`, *optional*, defaults to `{"height" -- 30, "width": 30}`):

## FuyuProcessor[[transformers.FuyuProcessor]]

- **image_processor** (`FuyuImageProcessor`) --
  The image processor is a required input.
- **tokenizer** (`TokenizersBackend`) --
  The tokenizer is a required input.
Constructs a FuyuProcessor which wraps a image processor and a tokenizer into a single processor.

[FuyuProcessor](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/model_doc/fuyu#transformers.FuyuProcessor) offers all the functionalities of [FuyuImageProcessor](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/model_doc/fuyu#transformers.FuyuImageProcessor) and [TokenizersBackend](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/main_classes/tokenizer#transformers.TokenizersBackend). See the
[~FuyuImageProcessor](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/model_doc/fuyu#transformers.FuyuImageProcessor) and [~TokenizersBackend](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/main_classes/tokenizer#transformers.TokenizersBackend) for more information.

- **images** (`Union[PIL.Image.Image, numpy.ndarray, torch.Tensor, list[PIL.Image.Image], list[numpy.ndarray], list[torch.Tensor]]`, *optional*) --
  Image to preprocess. Expects a single or batch of images with pixel values ranging from 0 to 255. If
  passing in images with pixel values between 0 and 1, set `do_rescale=False`.
- **text** (`Union[str, list[str]]`, *optional*) --
  The sequence or batch of sequences to be encoded. Each sequence can be a string or a list of strings
  (pretokenized string). If you pass a pretokenized input, set `is_split_into_words=True` to avoid ambiguity with batched inputs.
- **return_tensors** (`str` or [TensorType](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/internal/file_utils#transformers.TensorType), *optional*) --
  If set, will return tensors of a particular framework. Acceptable values are:

  - `'pt'`: Return PyTorch `torch.Tensor` objects.
  - `'np'`: Return NumPy `np.ndarray` objects.
- ****kwargs** ([ProcessingKwargs](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/main_classes/processors#transformers.ProcessingKwargs), *optional*) --
  Additional processing options for each modality (text, images, videos, audio). Model-specific parameters
  are listed above; see the TypedDict class for the complete list of supported arguments.`FuyuBatchEncoding`A `FuyuBatchEncoding` with the following fields:

- **input_ids** -- Tensor of token ids to be fed to a model. Returned when `text` is not `None`.
- **image_patches** -- List of Tensor of image patches. Returned when `images` is not `None`.
- **image_patches_indices** -- Tensor of indices where patch embeddings have to be inserted by the model.
- **attention_mask** -- List of indices specifying which tokens should be attended to by the model when
  `return_attention_mask=True`.
