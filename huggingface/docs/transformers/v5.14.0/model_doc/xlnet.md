# XLNet

## Overview

The XLNet model was proposed in [XLNet: Generalized Autoregressive Pretraining for Language Understanding](https://huggingface.co/papers/1906.08237) by Zhilin Yang, Zihang Dai, Yiming Yang, Jaime Carbonell, Ruslan Salakhutdinov,
Quoc V. Le. XLnet is an extension of the Transformer-XL model pre-trained using an autoregressive method to learn
bidirectional contexts by maximizing the expected likelihood over all permutations of the input sequence factorization
order.

The abstract from the paper is the following:

*With the capability of modeling bidirectional contexts, denoising autoencoding based pretraining like BERT achieves
better performance than pretraining approaches based on autoregressive language modeling. However, relying on
corrupting the input with masks, BERT neglects dependency between the masked positions and suffers from a
pretrain-finetune discrepancy. In light of these pros and cons, we propose XLNet, a generalized autoregressive
pretraining method that (1) enables learning bidirectional contexts by maximizing the expected likelihood over all
permutations of the factorization order and (2) overcomes the limitations of BERT thanks to its autoregressive
formulation. Furthermore, XLNet integrates ideas from Transformer-XL, the state-of-the-art autoregressive model, into
pretraining. Empirically, under comparable experiment settings, XLNet outperforms BERT on 20 tasks, often by a large
margin, including question answering, natural language inference, sentiment analysis, and document ranking.*

This model was contributed by [thomwolf](https://huggingface.co/thomwolf). The original code can be found [here](https://github.com/zihangdai/xlnet/).

## Usage tips

- The specific attention pattern can be controlled at training and test time using the `perm_mask` input.
- Due to the difficulty of training a fully auto-regressive model over various factorization order, XLNet is pretrained
  using only a sub-set of the output tokens as target which are selected with the `target_mapping` input.
- To use XLNet for sequential decoding (i.e. not in fully bi-directional setting), use the `perm_mask` and
  `target_mapping` inputs to control the attention span and outputs (see examples in
  *examples/pytorch/text-generation/run_generation.py*)
- XLNet is one of the few models that has no sequence length limit.
- XLNet is not a traditional autoregressive model but uses a training strategy that builds on that. It permutes the tokens in the sentence, then allows the model to use the last n tokens to predict the token n+1. Since this is all done with a mask, the sentence is actually fed in the model in the right order, but instead of masking the first n tokens for n+1, XLNet uses a mask that hides the previous tokens in some given permutation of 1,…,sequence length.
- XLNet also uses the same recurrence mechanism as Transformer-XL to build long-term dependencies.

This is the configuration class to store the configuration of a XLNetModel. It is used to instantiate a Xlnet
model according to the specified arguments, defining the model architecture. Instantiating a configuration with the
defaults will yield a similar configuration to that of the [xlnet/xlnet-large-cased](https://huggingface.co/xlnet/xlnet-large-cased)

Configuration objects inherit from [PreTrainedConfig](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/main_classes/configuration#transformers.PreTrainedConfig) and can be used to control the model outputs. Read the
documentation from [PreTrainedConfig](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/main_classes/configuration#transformers.PreTrainedConfig) for more information.

Examples:

```python
>>> from transformers import XLNetConfig, XLNetModel

>>> # Initializing a XLNet configuration
>>> configuration = XLNetConfig()

>>> # Initializing a model (with random weights) from the configuration
>>> model = XLNetModel(configuration)

>>> # Accessing the model configuration
>>> configuration = model.config
```

- **config** ([XLNetForMultipleChoice](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/model_doc/xlnet#transformers.XLNetForMultipleChoice)) --
  Model configuration class with all the parameters of the model. Initializing with a config file does not
  load the weights associated with the model, only the configuration. Check out the
  [from_pretrained()](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/main_classes/model#transformers.PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained) method to load the model weights.

The Xlnet Model with a multiple choice classification head on top (a linear layer on top of the pooled output and a
softmax) e.g. for RocStories/SWAG tasks.

This model inherits from [PreTrainedModel](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/main_classes/model#transformers.PreTrainedModel). Check the superclass documentation for the generic methods the
library implements for all its model (such as downloading or saving, resizing the input embeddings, pruning heads
etc.)

This model is also a PyTorch [torch.nn.Module](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module) subclass.
Use it as a regular PyTorch Module and refer to the PyTorch documentation for all matter related to general usage
and behavior.

- **input_ids** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, num_choices, sequence_length)`) --
  Indices of input sequence tokens in the vocabulary.

  Indices can be obtained using [AutoTokenizer](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/model_doc/auto#transformers.AutoTokenizer). See [PreTrainedTokenizer.encode()](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/internal/tokenization_utils#transformers.PreTrainedTokenizerBase.encode) and
  [PreTrainedTokenizer.__call__()](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/internal/tokenization_utils#transformers.PreTrainedTokenizerBase.__call__) for details.

  [What are input IDs?](../glossary#input-ids)
- **token_type_ids** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, num_choices, sequence_length)`, *optional*) --
  Segment token indices to indicate first and second portions of the inputs. Indices are selected in `[0,
  1]`:

  - 0 corresponds to a *sentence A* token,
  - 1 corresponds to a *sentence B* token.

  [What are token type IDs?](../glossary#token-type-ids)
- **input_mask** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `batch_size, num_choices, sequence_length`, *optional*) --
  Mask to avoid performing attention on padding token indices. Negative of `attention_mask`, i.e. with 0 for
  real tokens and 1 for padding which is kept for compatibility with the original code base.

  Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:

  - 1 for tokens that are **masked**,
  - 0 for tokens that are **not masked**.

  You can only uses one of `input_mask` and `attention_mask`.
- **attention_mask** (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, *optional*) --
  Mask to avoid performing attention on padding token indices. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:

  - 0 for tokens that are **masked**.

  [What are attention masks?](../glossary#attention-mask)
- **mems** (`list[torch.FloatTensor]` of length `config.n_layers`) --
  Contains pre-computed hidden-states (see `mems` output below) . Can be used to speed up sequential
  decoding. The token ids which have their past given to this model should not be passed as `input_ids` as
  they have already been computed.

  `use_mems` has to be set to `True` to make use of `mems`.
- **perm_mask** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, sequence_length)`, *optional*) --
  Mask to indicate the attention pattern for each input token with values selected in `[0, 1]`:

  - if `perm_mask[k, i, j] = 0`, i attend to j in batch k;
  - if `perm_mask[k, i, j] = 1`, i does not attend to j in batch k.

  If not set, each token attends to all the others (full bidirectional attention). Only used during
  pretraining (to define factorization order) or for sequential decoding (generation).
- **target_mapping** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, num_predict, sequence_length)`, *optional*) --
  Mask to indicate the output tokens to use. If `target_mapping[k, i, j] = 1`, the i-th predict in batch k is
  on the j-th token. Only used during pretraining for partial prediction or for sequential decoding
  (generation).
- **inputs_embeds** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, num_choices, sequence_length, hidden_size)`, *optional*) --
  Optionally, instead of passing `input_ids` you can choose to directly pass an embedded representation. This
  is useful if you want more control over how to convert `input_ids` indices into associated vectors than the
  model's internal embedding lookup matrix.
- **labels** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size,)`, *optional*) --
  Labels for computing the multiple choice classification loss. Indices should be in `[0, ...,
- **use_mems** (`bool`, *optional*) --

  states from previous forward passes to compute attention, which can significantly improve performance for
  sequential decoding tasks.

  Whether or not to return the attentions tensors of all attention layers. See `attentions` under returned
  tensors for more detail.
- **output_hidden_states** (`bool`, *optional*) --

elements depending on the configuration ([XLNetConfig](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/model_doc/xlnet#transformers.XLNetConfig)) and inputs.
The [XLNetForMultipleChoice](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/model_doc/xlnet#transformers.XLNetForMultipleChoice) forward method, overrides the `__call__` special method.

Although the recipe for forward pass needs to be defined within this function, one should call the `Module`
instance afterwards instead of this since the former takes care of running the pre and post processing steps while
the latter silently ignores them.

- **loss** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape *(1,)*, *optional*, returned when `labels` is provided) -- Classification loss.

instance afterwards instead of this since the former takes care of running the pre and post processing steps while
the latter silently ignores them.

- **loss** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(1,)`, *optional*, returned when `labels` is provided) -- Total span extraction loss is the sum of a Cross-Entropy for the start and end positions.
- **start_logits** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length,)`) -- Span-start scores (before SoftMax).
- **end_logits** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length,)`) -- Span-end scores (before SoftMax).
- **mems** (`list[torch.FloatTensor]` of length `config.n_layers`) -- Contains pre-computed hidden-states. Can be used (see `mems` input) to speed up sequential decoding. The
  token ids which have their past given to this model should not be passed as `input_ids` as they have
  already been computed.
- **hidden_states** (`tuple[torch.FloatTensor, ...]`, *optional*, returned when `output_hidden_states=True` is passed or when `config.output_hidden_states=True`) -- Tuple of `torch.FloatTensor` (one for the output of the embeddings, if the model has an embedding layer, +
  one for the output of each layer) of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`.

  Hidden-states of the model at the output of each layer plus the optional initial embedding outputs.
- **attentions** (`tuple[torch.FloatTensor, ...]`, *optional*, returned when `output_attentions=True` is passed or when `config.output_attentions=True`) -- Tuple of `torch.FloatTensor` (one for each layer) of shape `(batch_size, num_heads, sequence_length,
  sequence_length)`.

  Attentions weights after the attention softmax, used to compute the weighted average in the self-attention
  heads.

Example:

```python
>>> from transformers import AutoTokenizer, XLNetForQuestionAnsweringSimple
>>> import torch

>>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("xlnet/xlnet-large-cased")
>>> model = XLNetForQuestionAnsweringSimple.from_pretrained("xlnet/xlnet-large-cased")

>>> inputs = tokenizer(question, text, return_tensors="pt")
>>> with torch.no_grad():
...     outputs = model(**inputs)

>>> answer_start_index = outputs.start_logits.argmax()
>>> answer_end_index = outputs.end_logits.argmax()

>>> predict_answer_tokens = inputs.input_ids[0, answer_start_index : answer_end_index + 1]

## XLNetForQuestionAnswering[[transformers.XLNetForQuestionAnswering]]

- **config** ([XLNetForQuestionAnswering](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/model_doc/xlnet#transformers.XLNetForQuestionAnswering)) --
  Model configuration class with all the parameters of the model. Initializing with a config file does not
  load the weights associated with the model, only the configuration. Check out the
  [from_pretrained()](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/main_classes/model#transformers.PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained) method to load the model weights.

The Xlnet transformer with a span classification head on top for extractive question-answering tasks like
SQuAD (a linear layer on top of the hidden-states output to compute `span start logits` and `span end logits`).

This model inherits from [PreTrainedModel](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/main_classes/model#transformers.PreTrainedModel). Check the superclass documentation for the generic methods the
library implements for all its model (such as downloading or saving, resizing the input embeddings, pruning heads
etc.)

This model is also a PyTorch [torch.nn.Module](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module) subclass.
Use it as a regular PyTorch Module and refer to the PyTorch documentation for all matter related to general usage
and behavior.

- **input_ids** (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, *optional*) --
  Indices of input sequence tokens in the vocabulary. Padding will be ignored by default.

  Indices can be obtained using [AutoTokenizer](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/model_doc/auto#transformers.AutoTokenizer). See [PreTrainedTokenizer.encode()](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/internal/tokenization_utils#transformers.PreTrainedTokenizerBase.encode) and
  [PreTrainedTokenizer.__call__()](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/internal/tokenization_utils#transformers.PreTrainedTokenizerBase.__call__) for details.

  [What are input IDs?](../glossary#input-ids)
- **attention_mask** (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, *optional*) --
  Mask to avoid performing attention on padding token indices. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:

  - 1 for tokens that are **not masked**,
  - 0 for tokens that are **masked**.

  [What are attention masks?](../glossary#attention-mask)
- **mems** (`list[torch.FloatTensor]` of length `config.n_layers`) --
  Contains pre-computed hidden-states (see `mems` output below) . Can be used to speed up sequential
  decoding. The token ids which have their past given to this model should not be passed as `input_ids` as
  they have already been computed.

  `use_mems` has to be set to `True` to make use of `mems`.
- **perm_mask** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, sequence_length)`, *optional*) --
  Mask to indicate the attention pattern for each input token with values selected in `[0, 1]`:

  - if `perm_mask[k, i, j] = 0`, i attend to j in batch k;
  - if `perm_mask[k, i, j] = 1`, i does not attend to j in batch k.

  If not set, each token attends to all the others (full bidirectional attention). Only used during
  pretraining (to define factorization order) or for sequential decoding (generation).
- **target_mapping** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, num_predict, sequence_length)`, *optional*) --
  Mask to indicate the output tokens to use. If `target_mapping[k, i, j] = 1`, the i-th predict in batch k is
  on the j-th token. Only used during pretraining for partial prediction or for sequential decoding
  (generation).
- **token_type_ids** (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, *optional*) --
  Segment token indices to indicate first and second portions of the inputs. Indices are selected in `[0, 1]`:

  - 0 corresponds to a *sentence A* token,
  - 1 corresponds to a *sentence B* token.

  [What are token type IDs?](../glossary#token-type-ids)
- **input_mask** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `batch_size, sequence_length`, *optional*) --
  Mask to avoid performing attention on padding token indices. Negative of `attention_mask`, i.e. with 0 for
  real tokens and 1 for padding which is kept for compatibility with the original code base.

  Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:

  - 1 for tokens that are **masked**,
  - 0 for tokens that are **not masked**.

  You can only uses one of `input_mask` and `attention_mask`.
- **inputs_embeds** (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`, *optional*) --
  Optionally, instead of passing `input_ids` you can choose to directly pass an embedded representation. This
  is useful if you want more control over how to convert `input_ids` indices into associated vectors than the
  model's internal embedding lookup matrix.
- **start_positions** (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(batch_size,)`, *optional*) --
  Labels for position (index) of the start of the labelled span for computing the token classification loss.
  Positions are clamped to the length of the sequence (`sequence_length`). Position outside of the sequence
  are not taken into account for computing the loss.
- **end_positions** (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(batch_size,)`, *optional*) --
  Labels for position (index) of the end of the labelled span for computing the token classification loss.
  Positions are clamped to the length of the sequence (`sequence_length`). Position outside of the sequence
  are not taken into account for computing the loss.
- **is_impossible** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size,)`, *optional*) --
  Labels whether a question has an answer or no answer (SQuAD 2.0)
- **cls_index** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size,)`, *optional*) --
  Labels for position (index) of the classification token to use as input for computing plausibility of the
  answer.
- **p_mask** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, *optional*) --
  Optional mask of tokens which can't be in answers (e.g. [CLS], [PAD], ...). 1.0 means token should be
  masked. 0.0 mean token is not masked.
- **use_mems** (`bool`, *optional*) --
  Whether to use memory states to speed up sequential decoding. If set to `True`, the model will use the hidden
  states from previous forward passes to compute attention, which can significantly improve performance for
  sequential decoding tasks.
- **output_attentions** (`bool`, *optional*) --
  Whether or not to return the attentions tensors of all attention layers. See `attentions` under returned
  tensors for more detail.
- **output_hidden_states** (`bool`, *optional*) --
  Whether or not to return the hidden states of all layers. See `hidden_states` under returned tensors for
  more detail.
- **return_dict** (`bool`, *optional*) --
  Whether or not to return a [ModelOutput](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/main_classes/output#transformers.utils.ModelOutput) instead of a plain tuple.[XLNetForQuestionAnsweringOutput](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/model_doc/xlnet#transformers.models.xlnet.modeling_xlnet.XLNetForQuestionAnsweringOutput) or `tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`A [XLNetForQuestionAnsweringOutput](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/model_doc/xlnet#transformers.models.xlnet.modeling_xlnet.XLNetForQuestionAnsweringOutput) or a tuple of
`torch.FloatTensor` (if `return_dict=False` is passed or when `config.return_dict=False`) comprising various
elements depending on the configuration ([XLNetConfig](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/model_doc/xlnet#transformers.XLNetConfig)) and inputs.
The [XLNetForQuestionAnswering](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/model_doc/xlnet#transformers.XLNetForQuestionAnswering) forward method, overrides the `__call__` special method.

Although the recipe for forward pass needs to be defined within this function, one should call the `Module`
instance afterwards instead of this since the former takes care of running the pre and post processing steps while
the latter silently ignores them.
