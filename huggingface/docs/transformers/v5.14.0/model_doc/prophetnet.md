# ProphetNet

## Overview

The ProphetNet model was proposed in [ProphetNet: Predicting Future N-gram for Sequence-to-Sequence Pre-training,](https://huggingface.co/papers/2001.04063) by Yu Yan, Weizhen Qi, Yeyun Gong, Dayiheng Liu, Nan Duan, Jiusheng Chen, Ruofei
Zhang, Ming Zhou on 13 Jan, 2020.

ProphetNet is an encoder-decoder model and can predict n-future tokens for "ngram" language modeling instead of just
the next token.

The abstract from the paper is the following:

*In this paper, we present a new sequence-to-sequence pretraining model called ProphetNet, which introduces a novel
self-supervised objective named future n-gram prediction and the proposed n-stream self-attention mechanism. Instead of
the optimization of one-step ahead prediction in traditional sequence-to-sequence model, the ProphetNet is optimized by
n-step ahead prediction which predicts the next n tokens simultaneously based on previous context tokens at each time
step. The future n-gram prediction explicitly encourages the model to plan for the future tokens and prevent
overfitting on strong local correlations. We pre-train ProphetNet using a base scale dataset (16GB) and a large scale
dataset (160GB) respectively. Then we conduct experiments on CNN/DailyMail, Gigaword, and SQuAD 1.1 benchmarks for
abstractive summarization and question generation tasks. Experimental results show that ProphetNet achieves new
state-of-the-art results on all these datasets compared to the models using the same scale pretraining corpus.*

## Usage tips

- ProphetNet is a model with absolute position embeddings so it's usually advised to pad the inputs on the right rather than
  the left.
- The model architecture is based on the original Transformer, but replaces the “standard” self-attention mechanism in the decoder by a main self-attention mechanism and a self and n-stream (predict) self-attention mechanism.

  - 1 for tokens that are **not masked**,
  - 0 for tokens that are **masked**.

  [What are attention masks?](../glossary#attention-mask)
- **decoder_input_ids** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, target_sequence_length)`, *optional*) --
  Indices of decoder input sequence tokens in the vocabulary.

  Indices can be obtained using [AutoTokenizer](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/model_doc/auto#transformers.AutoTokenizer). See [PreTrainedTokenizer.encode()](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/internal/tokenization_utils#transformers.PreTrainedTokenizerBase.encode) and
  [PreTrainedTokenizer.__call__()](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/internal/tokenization_utils#transformers.PreTrainedTokenizerBase.__call__) for details.

  [What are decoder input IDs?](../glossary#decoder-input-ids)

  ProphetNet uses the `eos_token_id` as the starting token for `decoder_input_ids` generation. If
  `past_key_values` is used, optionally only the last `decoder_input_ids` have to be input (see
  `past_key_values`).
- **decoder_attention_mask** (`torch.BoolTensor` of shape `(batch_size, target_sequence_length)`, *optional*) --
  Default behavior: generate a tensor that ignores pad tokens in `decoder_input_ids`. Causal mask will also
  be used by default.
- **encoder_outputs** (`tuple`, *optional*) --
  Tuple consists of (`last_hidden_state`, *optional*: `hidden_states`, *optional*: `attentions`)
  `last_hidden_state` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`, *optional*) is a sequence of
  hidden-states at the output of the last layer of the encoder. Used in the cross-attention of the decoder.
- **past_key_values** (`~cache_utils.Cache`, *optional*) --
  Pre-computed hidden-states (key and values in the self-attention blocks and in the cross-attention
  blocks) that can be used to speed up sequential decoding. This typically consists in the `past_key_values`
  returned by the model at a previous stage of decoding, when `use_cache=True` or `config.use_cache=True`.

  Only [Cache](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/internal/generation_utils#transformers.Cache) instance is allowed as input, see our [kv cache guide](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/kv_cache).
  If no `past_key_values` are passed, [DynamicCache](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/internal/generation_utils#transformers.DynamicCache) will be initialized by default.

  The model will output the same cache format that is fed as input.

  If `past_key_values` are used, the user is expected to input only unprocessed `input_ids` (those that don't
  have their past key value states given to this model) of shape `(batch_size, unprocessed_length)` instead of all `input_ids`
  of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`.
- **inputs_embeds** (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`, *optional*) --
  Optionally, instead of passing `input_ids` you can choose to directly pass an embedded representation. This
  is useful if you want more control over how to convert `input_ids` indices into associated vectors than the
  model's internal embedding lookup matrix.
- **decoder_inputs_embeds** (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(batch_size, target_sequence_length, hidden_size)`, *optional*) --
  Optionally, instead of passing `decoder_input_ids` you can choose to directly pass an embedded
  representation. If `past_key_values` is used, optionally only the last `decoder_inputs_embeds` have to be
  input (see `past_key_values`). This is useful if you want more control over how to convert
  `decoder_input_ids` indices into associated vectors than the model's internal embedding lookup matrix.

  If `decoder_input_ids` and `decoder_inputs_embeds` are both unset, `decoder_inputs_embeds` takes the value
  of `inputs_embeds`.
- **use_cache** (`bool`, *optional*) --
  If set to `True`, `past_key_values` key value states are returned and can be used to speed up decoding (see
  `past_key_values`).
- **output_attentions** (`bool`, *optional*) --
  Whether or not to return the attentions tensors of all attention layers. See `attentions` under returned
  tensors for more detail.
- **output_hidden_states** (`bool`, *optional*) --
  Whether or not to return the hidden states of all layers. See `hidden_states` under returned tensors for
  more detail.
- **return_dict** (`bool`, *optional*) --
  Whether or not to return a [ModelOutput](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/main_classes/output#transformers.utils.ModelOutput) instead of a plain tuple.[ProphetNetSeq2SeqModelOutput](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/model_doc/prophetnet#transformers.models.prophetnet.modeling_prophetnet.ProphetNetSeq2SeqModelOutput) or `tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`A [ProphetNetSeq2SeqModelOutput](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/model_doc/prophetnet#transformers.models.prophetnet.modeling_prophetnet.ProphetNetSeq2SeqModelOutput) or a tuple of

elements depending on the configuration ([ProphetNetConfig](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/model_doc/prophetnet#transformers.ProphetNetConfig)) and inputs.
The [ProphetNetModel](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/model_doc/prophetnet#transformers.ProphetNetModel) forward method, overrides the `__call__` special method.

Although the recipe for forward pass needs to be defined within this function, one should call the `Module`
instance afterwards instead of this since the former takes care of running the pre and post processing steps while
the latter silently ignores them.

- **last_hidden_state** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, decoder_sequence_length, hidden_size)`) -- Sequence of main stream hidden-states at the output of the last layer of the decoder of the model.

  If `past_key_values` is used only the last hidden-state of the sequences of shape `(batch_size, 1,
  hidden_size)` is output.

  `past_key_values`).
- **decoder_attention_mask** (`torch.BoolTensor` of shape `(batch_size, target_sequence_length)`, *optional*) --
  Default behavior: generate a tensor that ignores pad tokens in `decoder_input_ids`. Causal mask will also
  be used by default.
- **encoder_outputs** (`torch.Tensor`, *optional*) --
  Tuple consists of (`last_hidden_state`, *optional*: `hidden_states`, *optional*: `attentions`)
  `last_hidden_state` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`, *optional*) is a sequence of
  hidden-states at the output of the last layer of the encoder. Used in the cross-attention of the decoder.
- **past_key_values** (`~cache_utils.Cache`, *optional*) --
  Pre-computed hidden-states (key and values in the self-attention blocks and in the cross-attention
  blocks) that can be used to speed up sequential decoding. This typically consists in the `past_key_values`
  returned by the model at a previous stage of decoding, when `use_cache=True` or `config.use_cache=True`.

  Only [Cache](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/internal/generation_utils#transformers.Cache) instance is allowed as input, see our [kv cache guide](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/kv_cache).
  If no `past_key_values` are passed, [DynamicCache](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/internal/generation_utils#transformers.DynamicCache) will be initialized by default.

  The model will output the same cache format that is fed as input.

  If `past_key_values` are used, the user is expected to input only unprocessed `input_ids` (those that don't
  have their past key value states given to this model) of shape `(batch_size, unprocessed_length)` instead of all `input_ids`
  of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`.
- **inputs_embeds** (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`, *optional*) --
  Optionally, instead of passing `input_ids` you can choose to directly pass an embedded representation. This
  is useful if you want more control over how to convert `input_ids` indices into associated vectors than the
  model's internal embedding lookup matrix.
- **decoder_inputs_embeds** (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(batch_size, target_sequence_length, hidden_size)`, *optional*) --
  Optionally, instead of passing `decoder_input_ids` you can choose to directly pass an embedded
  representation. If `past_key_values` is used, optionally only the last `decoder_inputs_embeds` have to be
  input (see `past_key_values`). This is useful if you want more control over how to convert
  `decoder_input_ids` indices into associated vectors than the model's internal embedding lookup matrix.

  If `decoder_input_ids` and `decoder_inputs_embeds` are both unset, `decoder_inputs_embeds` takes the value
  of `inputs_embeds`.
- **labels** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size,)`, *optional*) --
  Labels for computing the sequence classification/regression loss. Indices should be in `[-100, 0, ...,
  config.vocab_size - 1]`. All labels set to `-100` are ignored (masked), the loss is only computed for
  labels in `[0, ..., config.vocab_size]`
- **use_cache** (`bool`, *optional*) --
  If set to `True`, `past_key_values` key value states are returned and can be used to speed up decoding (see
  `past_key_values`).
- **output_attentions** (`bool`, *optional*) --
  Whether or not to return the attentions tensors of all attention layers. See `attentions` under returned
  tensors for more detail.
- **output_hidden_states** (`bool`, *optional*) --
  Whether or not to return the hidden states of all layers. See `hidden_states` under returned tensors for
  more detail.
- **return_dict** (`bool`, *optional*) --
  Whether or not to return a [ModelOutput](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/main_classes/output#transformers.utils.ModelOutput) instead of a plain tuple.[ProphetNetSeq2SeqLMOutput](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/model_doc/prophetnet#transformers.models.prophetnet.modeling_prophetnet.ProphetNetSeq2SeqLMOutput) or `tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`A [ProphetNetSeq2SeqLMOutput](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/model_doc/prophetnet#transformers.models.prophetnet.modeling_prophetnet.ProphetNetSeq2SeqLMOutput) or a tuple of
`torch.FloatTensor` (if `return_dict=False` is passed or when `config.return_dict=False`) comprising various
elements depending on the configuration ([ProphetNetConfig](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/model_doc/prophetnet#transformers.ProphetNetConfig)) and inputs.
The [ProphetNetForConditionalGeneration](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/model_doc/prophetnet#transformers.ProphetNetForConditionalGeneration) forward method, overrides the `__call__` special method.

Although the recipe for forward pass needs to be defined within this function, one should call the `Module`
instance afterwards instead of this since the former takes care of running the pre and post processing steps while
the latter silently ignores them.

- **loss** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(1,)`, *optional*, returned when `labels` is provided) -- Language modeling loss.
- **logits** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, decoder_sequence_length, config.vocab_size)`) -- Prediction scores of the main stream language modeling head (scores for each vocabulary token before

For more details, see our [kv cache guide](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/kv_cache).
