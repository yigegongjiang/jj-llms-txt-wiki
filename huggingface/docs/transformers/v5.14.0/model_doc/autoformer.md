# Autoformer

## Overview

The Autoformer model was proposed in [Autoformer: Decomposition Transformers with Auto-Correlation for Long-Term Series Forecasting](https://huggingface.co/papers/2106.13008) by Haixu Wu, Jiehui Xu, Jianmin Wang, Mingsheng Long.

This model augments the Transformer as a deep decomposition architecture, which can progressively decompose the trend and seasonal components during the forecasting process.

The abstract from the paper is the following:

*Extending the forecasting time is a critical demand for real applications, such as extreme weather early warning and long-term energy consumption planning. This paper studies the long-term forecasting problem of time series. Prior Transformer-based models adopt various self-attention mechanisms to discover the long-range dependencies. However, intricate temporal patterns of the long-term future prohibit the model from finding reliable dependencies. Also, Transformers have to adopt the sparse versions of point-wise self-attentions for long series efficiency, resulting in the information utilization bottleneck. Going beyond Transformers, we design Autoformer as a novel decomposition architecture with an Auto-Correlation mechanism. We break with the pre-processing convention of series decomposition and renovate it as a basic inner block of deep models. This design empowers Autoformer with progressive decomposition capacities for complex time series. Further, inspired by the stochastic process theory, we design the Auto-Correlation mechanism based on the series periodicity, which conducts the dependencies discovery and representation aggregation at the sub-series level. Auto-Correlation outperforms self-attention in both efficiency and accuracy. In long-term forecasting, Autoformer yields state-of-the-art accuracy, with a 38% relative improvement on six benchmarks, covering five practical applications: energy, traffic, economics, weather and disease.*

This is the configuration class to store the configuration of a AutoformerModel. It is used to instantiate a Autoformer
model according to the specified arguments, defining the model architecture. Instantiating a configuration with the
defaults will yield a similar configuration to that of the [huggingface/autoformer-tourism-monthly](https://huggingface.co/huggingface/autoformer-tourism-monthly)

Configuration objects inherit from [PreTrainedConfig](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/main_classes/configuration#transformers.PreTrainedConfig) and can be used to control the model outputs. Read the
documentation from [PreTrainedConfig](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/main_classes/configuration#transformers.PreTrainedConfig) for more information.

Example:

```python
>>> from transformers import AutoformerConfig, AutoformerModel

>>> # Initializing a default Autoformer configuration
>>> configuration = AutoformerConfig()

>>> # Randomly initializing a model (with random weights) from the configuration
>>> model = AutoformerModel(configuration)

>>> # Accessing the model configuration
>>> configuration = model.config
```

## AutoformerModel[[transformers.AutoformerModel]]

- **config** ([AutoformerConfig](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/model_doc/autoformer#transformers.AutoformerConfig)) --
  Model configuration class with all the parameters of the model. Initializing with a config file does not
  load the weights associated with the model, only the configuration. Check out the

The bare Autoformer Model outputting raw hidden-states without any specific head on top.

This model inherits from [PreTrainedModel](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/main_classes/model#transformers.PreTrainedModel). Check the superclass documentation for the generic methods the
library implements for all its model (such as downloading or saving, resizing the input embeddings, pruning heads
etc.)

This model is also a PyTorch [torch.nn.Module](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module) subclass.

- **past_values** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`) --
  Past values of the time series, that serve as context in order to predict the future. These values may
  contain lags, i.e. additional values from the past which are added in order to serve as "extra context".
  The `past_values` is what the Transformer encoder gets as input (with optional additional features, such as
  `static_categorical_features`, `static_real_features`, `past_time_features`).

  The sequence length here is equal to `context_length` + `max(config.lags_sequence)`.

  Missing values need to be replaced with zeros.
- **past_time_features** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, num_features)`, *optional*) --
  Optional time features, which the model internally will add to `past_values`. These could be things like
  "month of year", "day of the month", etc. encoded as vectors (for instance as Fourier features). These
  could also be so-called "age" features, which basically help the model know "at which point in life" a
  time-series is. Age features have small values for distant past time steps and increase monotonically the
  more we approach the current time step.

  These features serve as the "positional encodings" of the inputs. So contrary to a model like BERT, where
  the position encodings are learned from scratch internally as parameters of the model, the Time Series
  Transformer requires to provide additional time features.

  The Autoformer only learns additional embeddings for `static_categorical_features`.
- **past_observed_mask** (`torch.BoolTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, *optional*) --
  Boolean mask to indicate which `past_values` were observed and which were missing. Mask values selected in
  `[0, 1]`:

  - 1 for values that are **observed**,
  - 0 for values that are **missing** (i.e. NaNs that were replaced by zeros).
- **static_categorical_features** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, number of static categorical features)`, *optional*) --
  Optional static categorical features for which the model will learn an embedding, which it will add to the
  values of the time series.

  Static categorical features are features which have the same value for all time steps (static over time).

  A typical example of a static categorical feature is a time series ID.
- **static_real_features** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, number of static real features)`, *optional*) --
  Optional static real features which the model will add to the values of the time series.

  Static real features are features which have the same value for all time steps (static over time).

  A typical example of a static real feature is promotion information.
- **future_values** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, prediction_length)`) --
  Future values of the time series, that serve as labels for the model. The `future_values` is what the
  Transformer needs to learn to output, given the `past_values`.

  See the demo notebook and code snippets for details.

  Missing values need to be replaced with zeros.
- **future_time_features** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, prediction_length, num_features)`, *optional*) --
  Optional time features, which the model internally will add to `future_values`. These could be things like
  "month of year", "day of the month", etc. encoded as vectors (for instance as Fourier features). These
  could also be so-called "age" features, which basically help the model know "at which point in life" a

  Transformer requires to provide additional features.

  The Autoformer only learns additional embeddings for `static_categorical_features`.
- **decoder_attention_mask** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, target_sequence_length)`, *optional*) --
  Mask to avoid performing attention on certain token indices. By default, a causal mask will be used, to
  make sure the model can only look at previous inputs in order to predict the future.
- **encoder_outputs** (`tuple(tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`, *optional*) --
  Tuple consists of `last_hidden_state`, `hidden_states` (*optional*) and `attentions` (*optional*)
  `last_hidden_state` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)` (*optional*) is a sequence of
  hidden-states at the output of the last layer of the encoder. Used in the cross-attention of the decoder.
- **past_key_values** (`~cache_utils.Cache`, *optional*) --
  Pre-computed hidden-states (key and values in the self-attention blocks and in the cross-attention
  blocks) that can be used to speed up sequential decoding. This typically consists in the `past_key_values`
  returned by the model at a previous stage of decoding, when `use_cache=True` or `config.use_cache=True`.

  Only [Cache](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/internal/generation_utils#transformers.Cache) instance is allowed as input, see our [kv cache guide](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/kv_cache).
  If no `past_key_values` are passed, [DynamicCache](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/internal/generation_utils#transformers.DynamicCache) will be initialized by default.

  The model will output the same cache format that is fed as input.

  If `past_key_values` are used, the user is expected to input only unprocessed `input_ids` (those that don't
  have their past key value states given to this model) of shape `(batch_size, unprocessed_length)` instead of all `input_ids`
  of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`.
- **use_cache** (`bool`, *optional*) --
  If set to `True`, `past_key_values` key value states are returned and can be used to speed up decoding (see
  `past_key_values`).`AutoformerModelOutput` or `tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`A `AutoformerModelOutput` or a tuple of
`torch.FloatTensor` (if `return_dict=False` is passed or when `config.return_dict=False`) comprising various
elements depending on the configuration ([AutoformerConfig](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/model_doc/autoformer#transformers.AutoformerConfig)) and inputs.
The [AutoformerModel](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/model_doc/autoformer#transformers.AutoformerModel) forward method, overrides the `__call__` special method.

Although the recipe for forward pass needs to be defined within this function, one should call the `Module`
instance afterwards instead of this since the former takes care of running the pre and post processing steps while
the latter silently ignores them.

- **last_hidden_state** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`) -- Sequence of hidden-states at the output of the last layer of the decoder of the model.

  If `past_key_values` is used only the last hidden-state of the sequences of shape `(batch_size, 1,
  hidden_size)` is output.
- **trend** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`) -- Trend tensor for each time series.
- **past_key_values** (`Cache`, *optional*, returned when `use_cache=True` is passed or when `config.use_cache=True`) -- It is a [Cache](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/internal/generation_utils#transformers.Cache) instance. For more details, see our [kv cache guide](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/kv_cache).

  blocks) that can be used (see `past_key_values` input) to speed up sequential decoding.

- **decoder_attentions** (`tuple[torch.FloatTensor]`, *optional*, returned when `output_attentions=True` is passed or when `config.output_attentions=True`) -- Tuple of `torch.FloatTensor` (one for each layer) of shape `(batch_size, num_heads, sequence_length,
  sequence_length)`.

  Attentions weights of the decoder, after the attention softmax, used to compute the weighted average in the
  self-attention heads.
- **cross_attentions** (`tuple[torch.FloatTensor]`, *optional*, returned when `output_attentions=True` is passed or when `config.output_attentions=True`) -- Tuple of `torch.FloatTensor` (one for each layer) of shape `(batch_size, num_heads, sequence_length,
  sequence_length)`.

  `last_hidden_state` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)` (*optional*) is a sequence of
  hidden-states at the output of the last layer of the encoder. Used in the cross-attention of the decoder.
- **past_key_values** (`~cache_utils.Cache`, *optional*) --
  Pre-computed hidden-states (key and values in the self-attention blocks and in the cross-attention
  blocks) that can be used to speed up sequential decoding. This typically consists in the `past_key_values`
  returned by the model at a previous stage of decoding, when `use_cache=True` or `config.use_cache=True`.

  Only [Cache](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/internal/generation_utils#transformers.Cache) instance is allowed as input, see our [kv cache guide](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/kv_cache).
  If no `past_key_values` are passed, [DynamicCache](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/internal/generation_utils#transformers.DynamicCache) will be initialized by default.

  The model will output the same cache format that is fed as input.

  If `past_key_values` are used, the user is expected to input only unprocessed `input_ids` (those that don't
  have their past key value states given to this model) of shape `(batch_size, unprocessed_length)` instead of all `input_ids`
  of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`.
- **use_cache** (`bool`, *optional*) --
  If set to `True`, `past_key_values` key value states are returned and can be used to speed up decoding (see
  `past_key_values`).[Seq2SeqTSPredictionOutput](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/main_classes/output#transformers.modeling_outputs.Seq2SeqTSPredictionOutput) or `tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`A [Seq2SeqTSPredictionOutput](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/main_classes/output#transformers.modeling_outputs.Seq2SeqTSPredictionOutput) or a tuple of
`torch.FloatTensor` (if `return_dict=False` is passed or when `config.return_dict=False`) comprising various
elements depending on the configuration ([AutoformerConfig](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/model_doc/autoformer#transformers.AutoformerConfig)) and inputs.
The [AutoformerForPrediction](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/model_doc/autoformer#transformers.AutoformerForPrediction) forward method, overrides the `__call__` special method.

Although the recipe for forward pass needs to be defined within this function, one should call the `Module`
instance afterwards instead of this since the former takes care of running the pre and post processing steps while
the latter silently ignores them.

- **loss** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(1,)`, *optional*, returned when a `future_values` is provided) -- Distributional loss.
- **params** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, num_samples, num_params)`) -- Parameters of the chosen distribution.
- **past_key_values** (`EncoderDecoderCache`, *optional*, returned when `use_cache=True` is passed or when `config.use_cache=True`) -- It is a [EncoderDecoderCache](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/internal/generation_utils#transformers.EncoderDecoderCache) instance. For more details, see our [kv cache guide](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/kv_cache).

  self-attention heads.
- **cross_attentions** (`tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`, *optional*, returned when `output_attentions=True` is passed or when `config.output_attentions=True`) -- Tuple of `torch.FloatTensor` (one for each layer) of shape `(batch_size, num_heads, sequence_length,
  sequence_length)`.

  Attentions weights of the decoder's cross-attention layer, after the attention softmax, used to compute the

- **loc** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size,)` or `(batch_size, input_size)`, *optional*) -- Shift values of each time series' context window which is used to give the model inputs of the same
  magnitude and then used to shift back to the original magnitude.
- **scale** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size,)` or `(batch_size, input_size)`, *optional*) -- Scaling values of each time series' context window which is used to give the model inputs of the same

Examples:

```python
>>> from huggingface_hub import hf_hub_download
>>> import torch
>>> from transformers import AutoformerForPrediction

>>> file = hf_hub_download(
...     repo_id="hf-internal-testing/tourism-monthly-batch", filename="train-batch.pt", repo_type="dataset"
... )
>>> batch = torch.load(file)

>>> model = AutoformerForPrediction.from_pretrained("huggingface/autoformer-tourism-monthly")

>>> # during training, one provides both past and future values
>>> # as well as possible additional features
>>> outputs = model(
...     past_values=batch["past_values"],
...     past_time_features=batch["past_time_features"],
...     past_observed_mask=batch["past_observed_mask"],
...     static_categorical_features=batch["static_categorical_features"],
...     future_values=batch["future_values"],
...     future_time_features=batch["future_time_features"],
... )

>>> loss = outputs.loss
>>> loss.backward()

>>> # during inference, one only provides past values
>>> # as well as possible additional features
>>> # the model autoregressively generates future values
>>> outputs = model.generate(
...     past_values=batch["past_values"],
...     past_time_features=batch["past_time_features"],
...     past_observed_mask=batch["past_observed_mask"],
...     static_categorical_features=batch["static_categorical_features"],
...     future_time_features=batch["future_time_features"],
... )

>>> mean_prediction = outputs.sequences.mean(dim=1)
```

The AutoformerForPrediction can also use static_real_features. To do so, set num_static_real_features in
AutoformerConfig based on number of such features in the dataset (in case of tourism_monthly dataset it

is equal to 1), initialize the model and call as shown below:

```
>>> from huggingface_hub import hf_hub_download
>>> import torch
>>> from transformers import AutoformerConfig, AutoformerForPrediction

>>> file = hf_hub_download(
...     repo_id="hf-internal-testing/tourism-monthly-batch", filename="train-batch.pt", repo_type="dataset"
... )
>>> batch = torch.load(file)

>>> # check number of static real features
>>> num_static_real_features = batch["static_real_features"].shape[-1]

>>> # load configuration of pretrained model and override num_static_real_features
>>> configuration = AutoformerConfig.from_pretrained(
...     "huggingface/autoformer-tourism-monthly",
...     num_static_real_features=num_static_real_features,
... )
>>> # we also need to update feature_size as it is not recalculated
>>> configuration.feature_size += num_static_real_features

>>> model = AutoformerForPrediction(configuration)

>>> outputs = model(
...     past_values=batch["past_values"],
...     past_time_features=batch["past_time_features"],
...     past_observed_mask=batch["past_observed_mask"],
...     static_categorical_features=batch["static_categorical_features"],
...     static_real_features=batch["static_real_features"],
...     future_values=batch["future_values"],
...     future_time_features=batch["future_time_features"],
... )
```
