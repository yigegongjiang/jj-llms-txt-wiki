# LXMERT

## Overview

The LXMERT model was proposed in [LXMERT: Learning Cross-Modality Encoder Representations from Transformers](https://huggingface.co/papers/1908.07490) by Hao Tan & Mohit Bansal. It is a series of bidirectional transformer encoders
(one for the vision modality, one for the language modality, and then one to fuse both modalities) pretrained using a
combination of masked language modeling, visual-language text alignment, ROI-feature regression, masked
visual-attribute modeling, masked visual-object modeling, and visual-question answering objectives. The pretraining
consists of multiple multi-modal datasets: MSCOCO, Visual-Genome + Visual-Genome Question Answering, VQA 2.0, and GQA.

The abstract from the paper is the following:

*Vision-and-language reasoning requires an understanding of visual concepts, language semantics, and, most importantly,
the alignment and relationships between these two modalities. We thus propose the LXMERT (Learning Cross-Modality
Encoder Representations from Transformers) framework to learn these vision-and-language connections. In LXMERT, we
build a large-scale Transformer model that consists of three encoders: an object relationship encoder, a language
encoder, and a cross-modality encoder. Next, to endow our model with the capability of connecting vision and language
semantics, we pre-train the model with large amounts of image-and-sentence pairs, via five diverse representative
pretraining tasks: masked language modeling, masked object prediction (feature regression and label classification),
cross-modality matching, and image question answering. These tasks help in learning both intra-modality and
cross-modality relationships. After fine-tuning from our pretrained parameters, our model achieves the state-of-the-art
results on two visual question answering datasets (i.e., VQA and GQA). We also show the generalizability of our
pretrained cross-modality model by adapting it to a challenging visual-reasoning task, NLVR, and improve the previous
best result by 22% absolute (54% to 76%). Lastly, we demonstrate detailed ablation studies to prove that both our novel
model components and pretraining strategies significantly contribute to our strong results; and also present several
attention visualizations for the different encoders*

## Usage tips

- Bounding boxes are not necessary to be used in the visual feature embeddings, any kind of visual-spacial features
  will work.
- Both the language hidden states and the visual hidden states that LXMERT outputs are passed through the
  cross-modality layer, so they contain information from both modalities. To access a modality that only attends to
  itself, select the vision/language hidden states from the first input in the tuple.
- The bidirectional cross-modality encoder attention only returns attention values when the language modality is used
  as the input and the vision modality is used as the context vector. Further, while the cross-modality encoder
  contains self-attention for each respective modality and cross-attention, only the cross attention is returned and
  both self attention outputs are disregarded.

library implements for all its model (such as downloading or saving, resizing the input embeddings, pruning heads
etc.)

This model is also a PyTorch [torch.nn.Module](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module) subclass.
Use it as a regular PyTorch Module and refer to the PyTorch documentation for all matter related to general usage
and behavior.

- **input_ids** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, *optional*) --
  Indices of input sequence tokens in the vocabulary. Padding will be ignored by default.

  Indices can be obtained using [AutoTokenizer](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/model_doc/auto#transformers.AutoTokenizer). See [PreTrainedTokenizer.encode()](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/internal/tokenization_utils#transformers.PreTrainedTokenizerBase.encode) and
  [PreTrainedTokenizer.__call__()](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/internal/tokenization_utils#transformers.PreTrainedTokenizerBase.__call__) for details.

  [What are input IDs?](../glossary#input-ids)
- **visual_feats** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, num_visual_features, visual_feat_dim)`) --
  This input represents visual features. They ROI pooled object features from bounding boxes using a
  faster-RCNN model)

  These are currently not provided by the transformers library.
- **visual_pos** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, num_visual_features, visual_pos_dim)`) --
  This input represents spatial features corresponding to their relative (via index) visual features. The
  pre-trained LXMERT model expects these spatial features to be normalized bounding boxes on a scale of 0 to
  1.

  These are currently not provided by the transformers library.
- **attention_mask** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, *optional*) --
  Mask to avoid performing attention on padding token indices. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:

  - 1 for tokens that are **not masked**,
  - 0 for tokens that are **masked**.

  [What are attention masks?](../glossary#attention-mask)
- **visual_attention_mask** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, *optional*) --
  Mask to avoid performing attention on padding token indices. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:

  - 1 for tokens that are **not masked**,
  - 0 for tokens that are **masked**.

  [What are attention masks?](../glossary#attention-mask)
- **token_type_ids** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, *optional*) --
  Segment token indices to indicate first and second portions of the inputs. Indices are selected in `[0, 1]`:

  - 0 corresponds to a *sentence A* token,
  - 1 corresponds to a *sentence B* token.

  [What are token type IDs?](../glossary#token-type-ids)
- **inputs_embeds** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`, *optional*) --
  Optionally, instead of passing `input_ids` you can choose to directly pass an embedded representation. This
  is useful if you want more control over how to convert `input_ids` indices into associated vectors than the
  model's internal embedding lookup matrix.
- **labels** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, *optional*) --
  Labels for computing the masked language modeling loss. Indices should be in `[-100, 0, ...,
  config.vocab_size]` (see `input_ids` docstring) Tokens with indices set to `-100` are ignored (masked), the
  loss is only computed for the tokens with labels in `[0, ..., config.vocab_size]`
- **obj_labels** (`dict[Str -- tuple[Torch.FloatTensor, Torch.FloatTensor]]`, *optional*):
  each key is named after each one of the visual losses and each element of the tuple is of the shape
  `(batch_size, num_features)` and `(batch_size, num_features, visual_feature_dim)` for each the label id and
  the label score respectively
- **matched_label** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size,)`, *optional*) --
  Labels for computing the whether or not the text input matches the image (classification) loss. Input
  should be a sequence pair (see `input_ids` docstring) Indices should be in `[0, 1]`:

  - 0 indicates that the sentence does not match the image,
  - 1 indicates that the sentence does match the image.
- **ans** (`Torch.Tensor` of shape `(batch_size)`, *optional*) --
  a one hot representation hof the correct answer *optional*
- **output_attentions** (`bool`, *optional*) --
  Whether or not to return the attentions tensors of all attention layers. See `attentions` under returned
  tensors for more detail.
- **output_hidden_states** (`bool`, *optional*) --
  Whether or not to return the hidden states of all layers. See `hidden_states` under returned tensors for
  more detail.
- **return_dict** (`bool`, *optional*) --
  Whether or not to return a [ModelOutput](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/main_classes/output#transformers.utils.ModelOutput) instead of a plain tuple.[LxmertForPreTrainingOutput](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/model_doc/lxmert#transformers.models.lxmert.modeling_lxmert.LxmertForPreTrainingOutput) or `tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`A [LxmertForPreTrainingOutput](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/model_doc/lxmert#transformers.models.lxmert.modeling_lxmert.LxmertForPreTrainingOutput) or a tuple of
`torch.FloatTensor` (if `return_dict=False` is passed or when `config.return_dict=False`) comprising various
elements depending on the configuration ([LxmertConfig](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/model_doc/lxmert#transformers.LxmertConfig)) and inputs.
The [LxmertForPreTraining](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/model_doc/lxmert#transformers.LxmertForPreTraining) forward method, overrides the `__call__` special method.

Although the recipe for forward pass needs to be defined within this function, one should call the `Module`
instance afterwards instead of this since the former takes care of running the pre and post processing steps while
the latter silently ignores them.

- **loss** (`*optional*`, returned when `labels` is provided, `torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(1,)`) -- Total loss as the sum of the masked language modeling loss and the next sequence prediction
  (classification) loss.
- **prediction_logits** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, config.vocab_size)`) -- Prediction scores of the language modeling head (scores for each vocabulary token before SoftMax).
- **cross_relationship_score** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, 2)`) -- Prediction scores of the textual matching objective (classification) head (scores of True/False
  continuation before SoftMax).
- **question_answering_score** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, n_qa_answers)`) -- Prediction scores of question answering objective (classification).
- **language_hidden_states** (`tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`, *optional*, returned when `output_hidden_states=True` is passed or when `config.output_hidden_states=True`) -- Tuple of `torch.FloatTensor` (one for input features + one for the output of each cross-modality layer) of
  shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`.
- **vision_hidden_states** (`tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`, *optional*, returned when `output_hidden_states=True` is passed or when `config.output_hidden_states=True`) -- Tuple of `torch.FloatTensor` (one for input features + one for the output of each cross-modality layer) of
  shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`.
- **language_attentions** (`tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`, *optional*, returned when `output_attentions=True` is passed or when `config.output_attentions=True`) -- Tuple of `torch.FloatTensor` (one for each layer) of shape `(batch_size, num_heads, sequence_length,
  sequence_length)`. Attentions weights after the attention softmax, used to compute the weighted average in
  the self-attention heads.
- **vision_attentions** (`tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`, *optional*, returned when `output_attentions=True` is passed or when `config.output_attentions=True`) -- Tuple of `torch.FloatTensor` (one for each layer) of shape `(batch_size, num_heads, sequence_length,

- **config** ([LxmertForQuestionAnswering](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/model_doc/lxmert#transformers.LxmertForQuestionAnswering)) --
  Model configuration class with all the parameters of the model. Initializing with a config file does not
  load the weights associated with the model, only the configuration. Check out the
  [from_pretrained()](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/main_classes/model#transformers.PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained) method to load the model weights.
