# Perceiver

## Overview

The Perceiver IO model was proposed in [Perceiver IO: A General Architecture for Structured Inputs &
Outputs](https://huggingface.co/papers/2107.14795) by Andrew Jaegle, Sebastian Borgeaud, Jean-Baptiste Alayrac, Carl Doersch,
Catalin Ionescu, David Ding, Skanda Koppula, Daniel Zoran, Andrew Brock, Evan Shelhamer, Olivier Hénaff, Matthew M.
Botvinick, Andrew Zisserman, Oriol Vinyals, João Carreira.

Perceiver IO is a generalization of [Perceiver](https://huggingface.co/papers/2103.03206) to handle arbitrary outputs in
addition to arbitrary inputs. The original Perceiver only produced a single classification label. In addition to
classification labels, Perceiver IO can produce (for example) language, optical flow, and multimodal videos with audio.
This is done using the same building blocks as the original Perceiver. The computational complexity of Perceiver IO is
linear in the input and output size and the bulk of the processing occurs in the latent space, allowing us to process
inputs and outputs that are much larger than can be handled by standard Transformers. This means, for example,
Perceiver IO can do BERT-style masked language modeling directly using bytes instead of tokenized inputs.

The abstract from the paper is the following:

*The recently-proposed Perceiver model obtains good results on several domains (images, audio, multimodal, point
clouds) while scaling linearly in compute and memory with the input size. While the Perceiver supports many kinds of
inputs, it can only produce very simple outputs such as class scores. Perceiver IO overcomes this limitation without
sacrificing the original's appealing properties by learning to flexibly query the model's latent space to produce
outputs of arbitrary size and semantics. Perceiver IO still decouples model depth from data size and still scales
linearly with data size, but now with respect to both input and output sizes. The full Perceiver IO model achieves
strong results on tasks with highly structured output spaces, such as natural language and visual understanding,
StarCraft II, and multi-task and multi-modal domains. As highlights, Perceiver IO matches a Transformer-based BERT
baseline on the GLUE language benchmark without the need for input tokenization and achieves state-of-the-art
performance on Sintel optical flow estimation.*

Here's a TLDR explaining how Perceiver works:

The main problem with the self-attention mechanism of the Transformer is that the time and memory requirements scale
quadratically with the sequence length. Hence, models like BERT and RoBERTa are limited to a max sequence length of 512
tokens. Perceiver aims to solve this issue by, instead of performing self-attention on the inputs, perform it on a set
of latent variables, and only use the inputs for cross-attention. In this way, the time and memory requirements don't
depend on the length of the inputs anymore, as one uses a fixed amount of latent variables, like 256 or 512. These are
randomly initialized, after which they are trained end-to-end using backpropagation.

Internally, [PerceiverModel](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/model_doc/perceiver#transformers.PerceiverModel) will create the latents, which is a tensor of shape `(batch_size, num_latents,
d_latents)`. One must provide `inputs` (which could be text, images, audio, you name it!) to the model, which it will
use to perform cross-attention with the latents. The output of the Perceiver encoder is a tensor of the same shape. One
can then, similar to BERT, convert the last hidden states of the latents to classification logits by averaging along
the sequence dimension, and placing a linear layer on top of that to project the `d_latents` to `num_labels`.

This was the idea of the original Perceiver paper. However, it could only output classification logits. In a follow-up
work, PerceiverIO, they generalized it to let the model also produce outputs of arbitrary size. How, you might ask? The
idea is actually relatively simple: one defines outputs of an arbitrary size, and then applies cross-attention with the
last hidden states of the latents, using the outputs as queries, and the latents as keys and values.

So let's say one wants to perform masked language modeling (BERT-style) with the Perceiver. As the Perceiver's input
length will not have an impact on the computation time of the self-attention layers, one can provide raw bytes,
providing `inputs` of length 2048 to the model. If one now masks out certain of these 2048 tokens, one can define the
`outputs` as being of shape: `(batch_size, 2048, 768)`. Next, one performs cross-attention with the final hidden states
of the latents to update the `outputs` tensor. After cross-attention, one still has a tensor of shape `(batch_size,
2048, 768)`. One can then place a regular language modeling head on top, to project the last dimension to the
vocabulary size of the model, i.e. creating logits of shape `(batch_size, 2048, 262)` (as Perceiver uses a vocabulary
size of 262 byte IDs).

This is the configuration class to store the configuration of a PerceiverModel. It is used to instantiate a Perceiver
model according to the specified arguments, defining the model architecture. Instantiating a configuration with the
defaults will yield a similar configuration to that of the [deepmind/language-perceiver](https://huggingface.co/deepmind/language-perceiver)

Configuration objects inherit from [PreTrainedConfig](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/main_classes/configuration#transformers.PreTrainedConfig) and can be used to control the model outputs. Read the
documentation from [PreTrainedConfig](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/main_classes/configuration#transformers.PreTrainedConfig) for more information.

Example:

```python
>>> from transformers import PerceiverModel, PerceiverConfig

>>> # Initializing a Perceiver deepmind/language-perceiver style configuration
>>> configuration = PerceiverConfig()

>>> # Initializing a model from the deepmind/language-perceiver style configuration
>>> model = PerceiverModel(configuration)

>>> # Accessing the model configuration
>>> configuration = model.config
```

Construct a Perceiver tokenizer. The Perceiver simply uses raw bytes utf-8 encoding.

This tokenizer inherits from [PreTrainedTokenizer](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/main_classes/tokenizer#transformers.PythonBackend) which contains most of the main methods. Users should refer to
this superclass for more information regarding those methods.

- **text** (`str`, `list[str]`, `list[list[str]]`, *optional*) --
  The sequence or batch of sequences to be encoded. Each sequence can be a string or a list of strings
  (pretokenized string). If the sequences are provided as list of strings (pretokenized), you must set
  `is_split_into_words=True` (to lift the ambiguity with a batch of sequences).
- **text_pair** (`str`, `list[str]`, `list[list[str]]`, *optional*) --
  The sequence or batch of sequences to be encoded. Each sequence can be a string or a list of strings
  (pretokenized string). If the sequences are provided as list of strings (pretokenized), you must set
  `is_split_into_words=True` (to lift the ambiguity with a batch of sequences).
- **text_target** (`str`, `list[str]`, `list[list[str]]`, *optional*) --
  The sequence or batch of sequences to be encoded as target texts. Each sequence can be a string or a
  list of strings (pretokenized string). If the sequences are provided as list of strings (pretokenized),
  you must set `is_split_into_words=True` (to lift the ambiguity with a batch of sequences).
- **text_pair_target** (`str`, `list[str]`, `list[list[str]]`, *optional*) --
  The sequence or batch of sequences to be encoded as target texts. Each sequence can be a string or a
  list of strings (pretokenized string). If the sequences are provided as list of strings (pretokenized),
  you must set `is_split_into_words=True` (to lift the ambiguity with a batch of sequences).
- **tokenizer_kwargs** (`dict[str, Any]`, *optional*) --
  Additional kwargs to pass to the tokenizer. These will be merged with the explicit parameters and
  other kwargs, with explicit parameters taking precedence.

- **add_special_tokens** (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `True`) --
  Whether or not to add special tokens when encoding the sequences. This will use the underlying
  `PretrainedTokenizerBase.build_inputs_with_special_tokens` function, which defines which tokens are
  automatically added to the input ids. This is useful if you want to add `bos` or `eos` tokens
  automatically.
- **padding** (`bool`, `str` or [PaddingStrategy](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/internal/file_utils#transformers.utils.PaddingStrategy), *optional*, defaults to `False`) --
  Activates and controls padding. Accepts the following values:

  - `True` or `'longest'`: Pad to the longest sequence in the batch (or no padding if only a single
    sequence is provided).
  - `'max_length'`: Pad to a maximum length specified with the argument `max_length` or to the maximum
    acceptable input length for the model if that argument is not provided.
  - `False` or `'do_not_pad'` (default): No padding (i.e., can output a batch with sequences of different
    lengths).
- **truncation** (`bool`, `str` or [TruncationStrategy](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/internal/tokenization_utils#transformers.tokenization_utils_base.TruncationStrategy), *optional*, defaults to `False`) --
  Activates and controls truncation. Accepts the following values:

  - `True` or `'longest_first'`: Truncate to a maximum length specified with the argument `max_length` or
    to the maximum acceptable input length for the model if that argument is not provided. This will
    truncate token by token, removing a token from the longest sequence in the pair if a pair of
    sequences (or a batch of pairs) is provided.
  - `'only_first'`: Truncate to a maximum length specified with the argument `max_length` or to the
    maximum acceptable input length for the model if that argument is not provided. This will only
    truncate the first sequence of a pair if a pair of sequences (or a batch of pairs) is provided.
  - `'only_second'`: Truncate to a maximum length specified with the argument `max_length` or to the
    maximum acceptable input length for the model if that argument is not provided. This will only
    truncate the second sequence of a pair if a pair of sequences (or a batch of pairs) is provided.
  - `False` or `'do_not_truncate'` (default): No truncation (i.e., can output batch with sequence lengths
    greater than the model maximum admissible input size).
- **max_length** (`int`, *optional*) --
  Controls the maximum length to use by one of the truncation/padding parameters.

  If left unset or set to `None`, this will use the predefined model maximum length if a maximum length
  is required by one of the truncation/padding parameters. If the model has no specific maximum input
  length (like XLNet) truncation/padding to a maximum length will be deactivated.
- **stride** (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 0) --
  If set to a number along with `max_length`, the overflowing tokens returned when
  `return_overflowing_tokens=True` will contain some tokens from the end of the truncated sequence
  returned to provide some overlap between truncated and overflowing sequences. The value of this
  argument defines the number of overlapping tokens.
- **is_split_into_words** (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`) --
  Whether or not the input is already pre-tokenized (e.g., split into words). If set to `True`, the
  tokenizer assumes the input is already split into words (for instance, by splitting it on whitespace)
  which it will tokenize. This is useful for NER or token classification.
- **pad_to_multiple_of** (`int`, *optional*) --
  If set will pad the sequence to a multiple of the provided value. Requires `padding` to be activated.
  This is especially useful to enable the use of Tensor Cores on NVIDIA hardware with compute capability
  `>= 7.5` (Volta).
- **padding_side** (`str`, *optional*) --
  The side on which the model should have padding applied. Should be selected between ['right', 'left'].
  Default value is picked from the class attribute of the same name.
- **return_tensors** (`str` or [TensorType](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/internal/file_utils#transformers.TensorType), *optional*) --
  If set, will return tensors instead of list of python integers. Acceptable values are:

  - `'pt'`: Return PyTorch `torch.Tensor` objects.
  - `'np'`: Return Numpy `np.ndarray` objects.

- **return_token_type_ids** (`bool`, *optional*) --
  Whether to return token type IDs. If left to the default, will return the token type IDs according to
  the specific tokenizer's default, defined by the `return_outputs` attribute.

  [What are token type IDs?](../glossary#token-type-ids)
- **return_attention_mask** (`bool`, *optional*) --
  Whether to return the attention mask. If left to the default, will return the attention mask according
  to the specific tokenizer's default, defined by the `return_outputs` attribute.

  [What are attention masks?](../glossary#attention-mask)
- **return_overflowing_tokens** (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`) --
  Whether or not to return overflowing token sequences. If a pair of sequences of input ids (or a batch
  of pairs) is provided with `truncation_strategy = longest_first` or `True`, an error is raised instead
  of returning overflowing tokens.
- **return_special_tokens_mask** (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`) --
  Whether or not to return special tokens mask information.
- **return_offsets_mapping** (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`) --
  Whether or not to return `(char_start, char_end)` for each token.

  This is only available on fast tokenizers inheriting from [PreTrainedTokenizerFast](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/main_classes/tokenizer#transformers.TokenizersBackend), if using
  Python's tokenizer, this method will raise `NotImplementedError`.
- **return_length**  (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`) --
  Whether or not to return the lengths of the encoded inputs.
- **verbose** (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `True`) --
  Whether or not to print more information and warnings.

## PerceiverForOpticalFlow[[transformers.PerceiverForOpticalFlow]]

- **config** ([PerceiverForOpticalFlow](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/model_doc/perceiver#transformers.PerceiverForOpticalFlow)) --
  Model configuration class with all the parameters of the model. Initializing with a config file does not
  load the weights associated with the model, only the configuration. Check out the
  [from_pretrained()](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/main_classes/model#transformers.PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained) method to load the model weights.

Example use of Perceiver for optical flow, for tasks such as Sintel and KITTI. [PerceiverForOpticalFlow](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/model_doc/perceiver#transformers.PerceiverForOpticalFlow) uses
[PerceiverImagePreprocessor](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/model_doc/perceiver#transformers.models.perceiver.modeling_perceiver.PerceiverImagePreprocessor) (with *prep_type="patches"*) to preprocess the
input images, and [PerceiverOpticalFlowDecoder](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/model_doc/perceiver#transformers.models.perceiver.modeling_perceiver.PerceiverOpticalFlowDecoder) to decode the latent
representation of [PerceiverModel](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/model_doc/perceiver#transformers.PerceiverModel).

As input, one concatenates 2 subsequent frames along the channel dimension and extract a 3 x 3 patch around each pixel
(leading to 3 x 3 x 3 x 2 = 54 values for each pixel). Fixed Fourier position encodings are used to encode the position
of each pixel in the patch. Next, one applies the Perceiver encoder. To decode, one queries the latent representation
using the same encoding used for the input.

This model inherits from [PreTrainedModel](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/main_classes/model#transformers.PreTrainedModel). Check the superclass documentation for the generic methods the
library implements for all its model (such as downloading or saving, resizing the input embeddings, pruning heads
etc.)

This model is also a PyTorch [torch.nn.Module](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module) subclass.
Use it as a regular PyTorch Module and refer to the PyTorch documentation for all matter related to general usage
and behavior.

  Whether or not to return a [ModelOutput](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/main_classes/output#transformers.utils.ModelOutput) instead of a plain tuple.[PerceiverClassifierOutput](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/model_doc/perceiver#transformers.models.perceiver.modeling_perceiver.PerceiverClassifierOutput) or `tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`A [PerceiverClassifierOutput](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/model_doc/perceiver#transformers.models.perceiver.modeling_perceiver.PerceiverClassifierOutput) or a tuple of
`torch.FloatTensor` (if `return_dict=False` is passed or when `config.return_dict=False`) comprising various
elements depending on the configuration ([PerceiverConfig](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/model_doc/perceiver#transformers.PerceiverConfig)) and inputs.
The [PerceiverForOpticalFlow](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/model_doc/perceiver#transformers.PerceiverForOpticalFlow) forward method, overrides the `__call__` special method.

Although the recipe for forward pass needs to be defined within this function, one should call the `Module`
instance afterwards instead of this since the former takes care of running the pre and post processing steps while
the latter silently ignores them.

## PerceiverForMultimodalAutoencoding[[transformers.PerceiverForMultimodalAutoencoding]]

- **config** ([PerceiverConfig](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/model_doc/perceiver#transformers.PerceiverConfig)) --

  [from_pretrained()](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/main_classes/model#transformers.PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained) method to load the model weights.

Example use of Perceiver for multimodal (video) autoencoding, for tasks such as Kinetics-700.

[PerceiverForMultimodalAutoencoding](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/model_doc/perceiver#transformers.PerceiverForMultimodalAutoencoding) uses [PerceiverMultimodalPreprocessor](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/model_doc/perceiver#transformers.models.perceiver.modeling_perceiver.PerceiverMultimodalPreprocessor) to
preprocess the 3 modalities: images, audio and class labels. This preprocessor uses modality-specific preprocessors to
preprocess every modality separately, after which they are concatenated. Trainable position embeddings are used to pad
each modality to the same number of channels to make concatenation along the time dimension possible. Next, one applies
the Perceiver encoder.

[PerceiverMultimodalDecoder](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/model_doc/perceiver#transformers.models.perceiver.modeling_perceiver.PerceiverMultimodalDecoder) is used to decode the latent representation of
[PerceiverModel](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/model_doc/perceiver#transformers.PerceiverModel). This decoder uses each modality-specific decoder to construct queries. The decoder queries are
created based on the inputs after preprocessing. However, autoencoding an entire video in a single forward pass is
computationally infeasible, hence one only uses parts of the decoder queries to do cross-attention with the latent
representation. This is determined by the subsampled indices for each modality, which can be provided as additional
input to the forward pass of [PerceiverForMultimodalAutoencoding](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/model_doc/perceiver#transformers.PerceiverForMultimodalAutoencoding).

[PerceiverMultimodalDecoder](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/model_doc/perceiver#transformers.models.perceiver.modeling_perceiver.PerceiverMultimodalDecoder) also pads the decoder queries of the different
modalities to the same number of channels, in order to concatenate them along the time dimension. Next, cross-attention
is performed with the latent representation of [PerceiverModel](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/model_doc/perceiver#transformers.PerceiverModel).

Finally, `~models.perceiver.modeling_perceiver.PerceiverMultiModalPostprocessor` is used to turn this tensor into an
actual video. It first splits up the output into the different modalities, and then applies the respective
postprocessor for each modality.

Note that, by masking the classification label during evaluation (i.e. simply providing a tensor of zeros for the
"label" modality), this auto-encoding model becomes a Kinetics 700 video classifier.

This model inherits from [PreTrainedModel](/docs/transformers/v5.14.0/en/main_classes/model#transformers.PreTrainedModel). Check the superclass documentation for the generic methods the
