# Projects using kernels

This page shows how different projects use `kernels`.

## autoresearch

[karpathy/autoresearch](https://github.com/karpathy/autoresearch) [uses](https://github.com/karpathy/autoresearch/blob/c2450add72cc80317be1fe8111974b892da10944/train.py#L23) `kernels` to
integrate Flash-Attention 3 through the [get_kernel()](/docs/kernels/main/en/api/kernels#kernels.get_kernel) method.

## AReaL

[inclusionAI/AReaL](https://github.com/inclusionAI/AReaL) uses `kernels` in an opt-in manner to integrate
optimized attention mechanisms.

## transformers

[huggingface/transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/) primarily
depends on `kernels` for all optimizations related to optimized kernels, including
optimized attention implementations, MoE blocks, and quantization. Besides
[get_kernel()](/docs/kernels/main/en/api/kernels#kernels.get_kernel), it also uses [kernel layers](./layers) to optimize the forward passes
of common layers involved in the modeling blocks. Some references are available
[here]()
and [here](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Ahuggingface%2Ftransformers+use_kernel_forward_from_hub&type=code).

## diffusers

Similar to `transformers`, [huggingface/diffusers](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/) uses
`kernels` for integrating optimized kernels to [compute attention](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/blob/e5aa719241f9b74d6700be3320a777799bfab70a/src/diffusers/models/attention_dispatch.py).

Besides leveraging pre-built compute kernels, different projects
rely on `kernels` to also package, build, and distribute their
kernels on the Hugging Face Hub platform. This is made possible by the
["builder" component of `kernels`](./builder/writing-kernels).
Visit [huggingface.co/kernels](https://huggingface.co/kernels) to browse
the pre-built compute kernels available on the Hub.

Feel free to open a PR enlisting your project to show how `kernels`
is leveraged there.
