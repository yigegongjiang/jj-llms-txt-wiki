# Lock kernel versions

Projects that use `setuptools` can lock the kernel versions that should be
used. First specify the accepted versions in `pyproject.toml` and make
sure that `kernels` is a build dependency:

```toml
[build-system]
requires = ["kernels", "setuptools"]
build-backend = "setuptools.build_meta"

[tool.kernels.dependencies]
"kernels-community/activation" = 1
```

Then run `kernels lock .` in the project directory. This generates a `kernels.lock` file with
the locked revisions. The locked revision will be used when loading a kernel with
[get_locked_kernel()](/docs/kernels/main/en/api/kernels#kernels.get_locked_kernel):

```python
from kernels import get_locked_kernel

activation = get_locked_kernel("kernels-community/activation")
```

**Note:** the lock file is included in the package metadata, so it will only be visible
to `kernels` after doing an (editable or regular) installation of your project.

## Locked kernel layers

Locking is also supported for kernel layers. To use locked layers, register them
with the [LockedLayerRepository](/docs/kernels/main/en/api/layers#kernels.LockedLayerRepository) class:

```python
kernel_layer_mapping = {
    "SiluAndMul": {
        "cuda": LockedLayerRepository(
            repo_id="kernels-community/activation",
            layer_name="SiluAndMul",
        )
    }
}

register_kernel_mapping(kernel_layer_mapping)
```

Similarly, you can use the [LockedFuncRepository](/docs/kernels/main/en/api/layers#kernels.LockedFuncRepository) class to lock kernel function
versions:

```python
kernel_layer_mapping = {
    "silu_and_mul": {
        "cuda": LockedFuncRepository(
            repo_id="kernels-community/activation",
            func_name="silu_and_mul",
        )
    }
}

register_kernel_mapping(kernel_layer_mapping)
```

## Pre-downloading locked kernels

Locked kernels can be pre-downloaded by running `kernels download .` in your
project directory. This will download the kernels to your local Hugging Face
Hub cache.

The pre-downloaded kernels are used by the [get_locked_kernel()](/docs/kernels/main/en/api/kernels#kernels.get_locked_kernel) function.
[get_locked_kernel()](/docs/kernels/main/en/api/kernels#kernels.get_locked_kernel) will download a kernel when it is not pre-downloaded. If you
want kernel loading to error when a kernel is not pre-downloaded, you can use
the [load_kernel()](/docs/kernels/main/en/api/kernels#kernels.load_kernel) function instead:

```python
from kernels import load_kernel

activation = load_kernel("kernels-community/activation")
```
