### Quick Look
Most Reachy Mini apps are **web / JS apps**: a static page that drives the robot over WebRTC from any browser, with zero install for whoever uses it. This is the recommended path for new apps. The fastest way is to describe your idea to an AI coding agent:

> *I'd like to build a Reachy Mini web app that **[waves when I say hello]**. Read https://github.com/pollen-robotics/reachy_mini/blob/main/AGENTS.md first — it has everything you need.*

Prefer to stay in Python for on-robot control loops? The Python SDK is still available:

```python
from reachy_mini import ReachyMini
from reachy_mini.utils import create_head_pose

with ReachyMini() as mini:
    # Look up and tilt head
    mini.goto_target(
        head=create_head_pose(z=10, roll=15, degrees=True, mm=True),
        duration=1.0
    )
```
