## ⚡️ Quick Look
Control your robot in just **a few lines of code**:

```python
from reachy_mini import ReachyMini
from reachy_mini.utils import create_head_pose

with ReachyMini() as mini:
    # Look up and tilt head
    mini.goto_target(
        head=create_head_pose(z=10, roll=15, degrees=True, mm=True),
        duration=1.0
    )
```
