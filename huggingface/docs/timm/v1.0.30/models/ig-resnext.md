# Instagram ResNeXt WSL

A **ResNeXt** repeats a [building block](https://paperswithcode.com/method/resnext-block) that aggregates a set of transformations with the same topology. Compared to a [ResNet](https://paperswithcode.com/method/resnet), it exposes a new dimension,  *cardinality* (the size of the set of transformations) \\( C \\), as an essential factor in addition to the dimensions of depth and width.

This model was trained on billions of Instagram images using thousands of distinct hashtags as labels exhibit excellent transfer learning performance.

## How do I use this model on an image?

To load a pretrained model:

```py
>>> import timm
>>> model = timm.create_model('ig_resnext101_32x16d', pretrained=True)
>>> model.eval()
```

To load and preprocess the image:

```py
>>> import urllib
>>> from PIL import Image
>>> from timm.data import resolve_data_config
>>> from timm.data.transforms_factory import create_transform

>>> config = resolve_data_config({}, model=model)
>>> transform = create_transform(**config)

>>> url, filename = ("https://github.com/pytorch/hub/raw/master/images/dog.jpg", "dog.jpg")
>>> urllib.request.urlretrieve(url, filename)
>>> img = Image.open(filename).convert('RGB')
>>> tensor = transform(img).unsqueeze(0) # transform and add batch dimension
```

To get the model predictions:

```py
>>> import torch
>>> with torch.inference_mode():
...     out = model(tensor)
>>> probabilities = torch.nn.functional.softmax(out[0], dim=0)
>>> print(probabilities.shape)
>>> # prints: torch.Size([1000])
```

To get the top-5 predictions class names:

```py
>>> # Get imagenet class mappings
>>> url, filename = ("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pytorch/hub/master/imagenet_classes.txt", "imagenet_classes.txt")
>>> urllib.request.urlretrieve(url, filename)
>>> with open("imagenet_classes.txt", "r") as f:
...     categories = [s.strip() for s in f.readlines()]

>>> # Print top categories per image
>>> top5_prob, top5_catid = torch.topk(probabilities, 5)
>>> for i in range(top5_prob.size(0)):
...     print(categories[top5_catid[i]], top5_prob[i].item())
>>> # prints class names and probabilities like:
>>> # [('Samoyed', 0.6425196528434753), ('Pomeranian', 0.04062102362513542), ('keeshond', 0.03186424449086189), ('white wolf', 0.01739676296710968), ('Eskimo dog', 0.011717947199940681)]
```

Replace the model name with the variant you want to use, e.g. `ig_resnext101_32x16d`. You can find the IDs in the model summaries at the top of this page.

To extract image features with this model, follow the [timm feature extraction examples](../feature_extraction), just change the name of the model you want to use.

## How do I finetune this model?

You can finetune any of the pre-trained models just by changing the classifier (the last layer).

```py
>>> model = timm.create_model('ig_resnext101_32x16d', pretrained=True, num_classes=NUM_FINETUNE_CLASSES)
```
To finetune on your own dataset, you have to write a training loop or adapt [timm's training
script](https://github.com/rwightman/pytorch-image-models/blob/master/train.py) to use your dataset.

## How do I train this model?

You can follow the [timm recipe scripts](../training_script) for training a new model afresh.
