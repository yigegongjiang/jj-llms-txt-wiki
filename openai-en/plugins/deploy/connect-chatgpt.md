# Connect and test your plugin

> For the complete documentation index, see [llms.txt](/llms.txt). Markdown versions of documentation pages are available by appending `.md` to the page URL.

Test each capability before testing the complete installed plugin. If the
plugin includes an MCP server, start by connecting and evaluating the server in
developer mode. Then package the plugin with its skills and test the complete
experience. Skills-only plugins can skip the first section.

Keep your evaluation prompts and results throughout development so you can
compare behavior across releases.

## Test an MCP server (optional)

### Prepare the endpoint

Confirm that:

- The MCP server is available at a public HTTPS endpoint.
- The endpoint supports streamable HTTP, typically at `/mcp`.
- Tool names, descriptions, schemas, and annotations are present.
- Authentication discovery works for tools that require an account.

For local development, use
[Secure MCP Tunnel](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/secure-mcp-tunnels), a development tunnel,
or another HTTPS forwarding service.

### Inspect the MCP server

Use [MCP Inspector](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tools/inspector) to
list and call tools directly:

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector@latest
```

Exercise each tool with representative inputs, edge cases, missing identifiers,
and empty results. Verify schema validation, authentication errors, annotations,
confirmation behavior, and the model-readable result.

### Enable developer mode

In ChatGPT:

1. Open **Settings**.
2. Select **Security and login**.
3. Turn on **Developer mode**.

Developer mode availability can depend on account and workspace policy.

### Add the MCP server

1. Go to [ChatGPT Plugins](https://chatgpt.com/plugins).
2. Select the plus button.
3. Enter a user-facing name and description.
4. Enter the public MCP server URL, including the `/mcp` path.
5. Create the connection.
6. Review the tools and metadata discovered from the server.

If ChatGPT cannot connect, verify the HTTPS endpoint with MCP Inspector.
Resolve transport, initialization, schema, or authentication errors before
continuing.

### Check tool selection

Start a new conversation and add the MCP connection from the tools menu. Create
an evaluation set that includes:

- Direct requests that should call a specific tool.
- Indirect requests that express the same goal.
- Follow-up requests that reuse identifiers from earlier results.
- Write actions that require authorization or confirmation.
- Unsupported requests that shouldn't call a tool.

For each request, record the selected tool, arguments, result, errors, and
confirmation behavior. Rerun the set whenever you change tool names,
descriptions, schemas, or annotations.

If the server returns optional UI, test both the component and the
model-readable result.

### Test through the API Playground

For raw request and response logs, open the
[API Playground](https://platform.openai.com/playground):

1. Choose **Tools → Add → MCP Server**.
2. Enter the HTTPS endpoint and connect.
3. Run test prompts and inspect the request and response data.

### Refresh metadata

After changing tool names, descriptions, schemas, annotations, authentication,
or UI resources:

1. Deploy or restart the MCP server.
2. Open the connection at [ChatGPT Plugins](https://chatgpt.com/plugins).
3. Select **Refresh**.
4. Confirm that the advertised metadata changed.
5. Start a new conversation and rerun the affected tests.

This refresh flow applies to MCP servers connected in developer mode.
Published plugins with MCP use reviewed
[metadata snapshots](https://developers.openai.com/plugins/deploy/submission#how-published-mcp-metadata-versions-work).
To update published metadata, scan the server, submit a new version, and
publish the approved version.

Before packaging the plugin, confirm that:

- The tool list matches the documented capabilities.
- Structured results match each tool's declared output schema.
- Authentication failures return useful errors.
- Positive prompts select the expected tools and negative prompts don't.
- Optional UI renders without console errors and restores state correctly.

## Test the complete plugin

After the MCP server works—or immediately for a skills-only plugin—package and
install the complete plugin from a local source:

1. [Package the plugin](https://developers.openai.com/plugins/build/plugins) with its skills, manifest, and
   MCP server connection when applicable.
2. Add the plugin to a local marketplace and install it from the Plugins
   Directory.
3. Start a new conversation with the plugin enabled.
4. Run representative requests from the plugin's use-case inventory.

Create an evaluation set that includes:

- Direct requests that should use a skill.
- Indirect requests that express the same goal.
- Follow-up requests that depend on an earlier result.
- Negative requests that shouldn't use the plugin.
- Boundary cases that the plugin intentionally doesn't support.

For each request, check that the plugin follows the skill instructions, uses
the expected resources, completes every required step, and produces a useful
result. Record any missing steps, unnecessary activations, or inconsistent
results.

For plugins with an MCP server, also confirm that skills invoke the right tools,
tool results return to the workflow, authentication works after installation,
and users can complete each combined workflow from start to finish.

Before submission, confirm that:

- Each skill activates for the intended requests.
- Similar phrasing produces consistent behavior.
- Unsupported requests don't activate the plugin.
- Bundled files and references resolve after installation.
- The plugin's starter prompts represent workflows it can complete.
- For plugins with an MCP server, bundled skills and tools work together as
  intended.
