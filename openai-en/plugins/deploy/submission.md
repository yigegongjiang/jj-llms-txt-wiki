# Submit plugins

Use the plugin submission portal to submit a plugin for review when you're
ready to publish it for public use.

If the portal returns an error code, use the
[submission error reference](https://developers.openai.com/plugins/deploy/submission-errors) to find the
matching requirement.

A plugin can contain skills, an MCP server, or both. You can submit:

- A skills-only plugin that packages reusable workflows.
- An MCP-only plugin. Custom UI is optional.
- A plugin that combines an MCP server with bundled skills.

The submission form collects listing information, MCP server details, bundled
skills, starter prompts, test cases, country availability, and policy
attestations. Which fields you complete depends on whether the plugin includes
skills, an MCP server, or both.

For local development, packaging, and marketplace setup, see
[Build plugins](https://developers.openai.com/plugins/build/plugins).

For server-backed capabilities, see
[Build an MCP server](https://developers.openai.com/plugins/build/mcp-server).

## Before you submit

### Submit the MCP server, not an existing integration reference

You cannot submit a plugin that references an existing, already-published
integration. If your plugin includes an MCP server that already exists in
ChatGPT or Codex, submit that server from scratch through the portal as a new
MCP-backed plugin submission. The portal scans that MCP server, validates the
tool metadata, and uses the submitted server details during review.

### Get plugin submission access

You need an organization role with plugin submission write access before you
can create or submit plugin drafts. The Platform currently labels this
permission **Apps Management**.

1. Open [OpenAI Platform roles settings](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/people/roles).
2. Select the organization that owns the plugin.
3. Open the role assigned to the submitter, or create a new role.
4. In the role permissions, set **Apps Management** to **Write**.
5. Save the role and assign it to each person who needs to create, edit, or
   submit plugin drafts.
6. Reload the [plugin submission portal](https://platform.openai.com/plugins).

![Apps Management write permission in Platform role settings](https://developers.openai.com/images/codex/plugins/submit/apps-management-permissions.webp)

Organization owners already have these permissions. Non-owner submitters need
write access to create or submit drafts, and read access to view drafts and
review status.

### Verify your developer or business identity

Every public submission must use a verified developer or business identity in
the OpenAI Platform. Reviewers use this identity to confirm the submission
matches the name, website, support contact, privacy policy, and terms in your
public listing.

To verify an identity:

1. Sign in to the [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com).
2. Select the organization that will publish the plugin.
3. Open [organization settings](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/general).
4. Complete **individual verification** if you will publish under your own
   name, or **business verification** if you will publish under a company name.
5. Return to the plugin submission form and select the verified identity in the
   **Developer Identity** field.

Reviewers may reject submissions that use an unverified or mismatched publisher
identity. See the
[organization verification requirements](https://developers.openai.com/plugins/deploy/app-review#organization-verification)
for the underlying review rule.

If the Platform shows that the developer or business identity is verified but
the plugin submission form does not recognize it, check that you are submitting
from the same organization and project where the identity was verified. The
submitter also needs **Apps Management** write access for that organization.
Ask an organization owner or admin to update the role assigned to the person
submitting, then reload the plugin submission portal.

### Prepare required materials

## Create a plugin submission

1. Open the [plugin submission portal](https://platform.openai.com/plugins).
2. Select **Create plugin**.
3. Choose the submission type:
   - **Skills only** for a plugin that only packages skills.
   - **With MCP** for an MCP-only plugin.
   - **With MCP** for a plugin that combines an MCP server with bundled skills.

![Create plugin menu showing MCP and skills-only options](https://developers.openai.com/images/codex/plugins/submit/create-plugin-menu.webp)

The portal saves the submission as a draft while you complete the form.

## Complete the form

### Info

Complete the public listing and publisher fields:

- **Plugin name:** Use the customer-facing product or workflow name.
- **Descriptions:** Explain what the plugin helps users do. Keep the short
  description concise and use the long description for workflow details.
- **Developer Identity:** Select the verified individual or business identity
  for the publisher.
- **Logo and category:** Use production-ready brand assets.
- **Website, support, privacy, and terms URLs:** Use public URLs that match the
  publisher and disclose relevant data handling.

![Info tab with plugin listing and developer identity fields filled out](https://developers.openai.com/images/codex/plugins/submit/info-fields.webp)

![Info tab with publisher and policy URLs filled out](https://developers.openai.com/images/codex/plugins/submit/developer-identity.webp)

Review your MCP responses against your privacy policy before you submit. Remove
unnecessary personal data, auth secrets, debug payloads, internal identifiers,
and undisclosed user-related fields from tool responses.

### MCP

For submissions with MCP:

1. Enter the production MCP server URL.
2. Configure authentication and provide reviewer-ready demo credentials if the
   server requires sign-in.
3. Define a content security policy that allows the exact domains your UI
   fetches from.
4. Complete domain verification if the portal shows a **Domain not verified**
   challenge. Use an HTTPS origin on the MCP host name or a parent host name, and
   host the exact token at `/.well-known/openai-apps-challenge`.
5. Select **Scan Tools**.
6. Review the discovered tools, domains, validation output, and tool metadata.
7. Fix server or metadata issues, deploy the fix, then scan again.

![MCP tab after scanning a demo MCP server with metadata recommendations](https://developers.openai.com/images/codex/plugins/submit/mcp-scan.webp)

Do not enter an existing integration ID or try to point the portal at an
existing published integration. The submission must provide the MCP server URL
and review materials directly, even when that server backs an integration
already published in ChatGPT or Codex.

#### Domain verification

Plugins with MCP must verify control of the domain that hosts the server. When
the portal shows a domain verification challenge, place the exact verification
token at the generated well-known URL:

```text
https://<challenge-base-host>/.well-known/openai-apps-challenge
```

The challenge endpoint must return only that plugin's verification token. Do not
return JSON, a list of tokens, or multiple tokens from the same URL.

The **Challenge Base URL** is an optional HTTPS origin that tells the portal
where to check the token. It must be the MCP host name or a parent host name.
Paths are ignored. For example, if the MCP server URL is
`https://api.example.com/mcp`, the default challenge URL is
`https://api.example.com/.well-known/openai-apps-challenge`, and
`https://example.com` can be used as a parent-origin challenge base if you can
host the token there.

If two plugins with MCP share the same host name but differ only by
path, they also share the same default challenge URL. You cannot verify them
separately by putting different tenant paths in the Challenge Base URL, because
the path is ignored. Use a parent origin that can host the new token, give the
MCP server a distinct host name, or work with OpenAI support if neither
hosting option is possible.

If another plugin with MCP already uses the same host name, do
not replace its existing challenge token unless that plugin no longer needs it.
Use an allowed parent-origin Challenge Base URL or a distinct MCP host name for
the new submission.

Every tool should have clear names, descriptions, schemas, and output
structure. Add output schemas when they help reviewers and models understand
what the tool returns.

Set tool annotations to match each tool's real behavior:

| Annotation        | Use it when                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `readOnlyHint`    | Set to `true` only when the tool fetches, looks up, lists, retrieves, previews, or computes information and doesn't change anything. Set to `false` if the tool can create, update, delete, send, enqueue, run jobs, start workflows, write logs, or otherwise change state.                                                                           |
| `openWorldHint`   | For write tools, set to `true` if the tool can change publicly visible internet state, such as posting online, sending external messages, publishing content, pushing code, or submitting forms to third parties. Set to `false` only if the tool operates entirely within closed or private systems and can't change publicly visible internet state. |
| `destructiveHint` | For write tools, set to `true` if the tool can delete, overwrite, revoke access, send messages or transactions that can't be undone, or cause another irreversible side effect. Otherwise, set it to `false`.                                                                                                                                          |

For implementation details, see
[tool annotations and elicitation](https://developers.openai.com/plugins/build/mcp-server#tool-annotations-and-elicitation).
For review expectations, see the
[tool hint rejection guidance](https://developers.openai.com/plugins/deploy/app-review#review-and-approval-faqs).

### Skills

Upload the final skill bundle for skills-only or skills-plus-MCP submissions.
Use the same file tree and instructions you tested locally.

![Skills tab with a skill bundle ready to upload](https://developers.openai.com/images/codex/plugins/submit/skills-upload.webp)

Each skill should include:

- A clear `SKILL.md` with trigger conditions and task instructions.
- Any referenced scripts, templates, or assets.
- Minimal, scoped instructions that fit the plugin's purpose.

Uploaded skills are scanned for policy compliance and security risks, including
sensitive information, unnecessary access requests, and instructions that may
conflict with safe or expected plugin behavior. Skills must follow the same
standards as the rest of the plugin and may block submission or require
remediation if they fail automated scanning.

### Prompts

Add starter prompts that show the plugin's highest-value workflows. Good
prompts are specific enough to show when to use the plugin, but general enough
that users can adapt them.

Examples:

- "Investigate checkout errors from the last release and summarize likely root
  causes."
- "Create a P1 incident brief from the latest support tickets and related
  deploys."
- "Review unsuccessful deployment logs and recommend the next debugging step."

![Prompts tab with example starter prompts](https://developers.openai.com/images/codex/plugins/submit/prompts.webp)

### Testing

Submit at least five positive test cases and three negative test cases.

For each positive test case, include:

- User prompt.
- Expected tool, skill, or workflow behavior.
- Expected result shape.
- Test account or fixture data required to reproduce it.

For each negative test case, include:

- User prompt or scenario.
- Expected refusal, clarification, or safe fallback behavior.
- Why the plugin shouldn't complete the requested action.

Use test cases that reviewers can run without internal context. If your plugin
requires authentication, make sure the provided demo credentials can complete
each test without MFA, SMS, email confirmation, or private-network access.

![Testing tab with positive and negative test cases](https://developers.openai.com/images/codex/plugins/submit/testing.webp)

### Global

Choose the countries or regions where the plugin should be available. Only
select locations where the publisher, product, support process, and legal terms
are ready for users.

![Global tab for country and region availability](https://developers.openai.com/images/codex/plugins/submit/global.webp)

### Submit

Review the full draft before submitting.

In the release notes, summarize:

- What the plugin does.
- Whether this is an initial submission or an update.
- What changed since the prior submitted version, if any.
- Anything reviewers should know about test credentials, expected data, or
  setup.

Complete the policy attestations only after confirming the listing, server,
skills, prompts, tests, and availability are accurate. Then select
**Submit for Review**.

![Submit tab with release notes and final attestations](https://developers.openai.com/images/codex/plugins/submit/submit.webp)

## Public publishing flow

Submitting a plugin starts review; it doesn't publish the plugin immediately.
For public availability, the flow is:

1. Submit the plugin through the plugin submission portal.
2. OpenAI reviews the submission. Review timelines may vary as OpenAI builds
   and scales the review process.
3. After OpenAI approves the plugin, the developer chooses when to publish it
   and publishes it from the portal.
4. After publication, the plugin appears in the universal Plugins Directory
   shared by ChatGPT and Codex.

MCP-only, skills-only, and skills-plus-MCP plugins all
appear in the Plugins Directory.

### How published MCP metadata versions work

Plugins with MCP publish a reviewed metadata snapshot. To change that
snapshot, scan the MCP server, submit a new version for review, and publish the
approved version. See
[MCP server review requirements](https://developers.openai.com/plugins/deploy/app-review#how-published-mcp-metadata-versions-work)
for the complete maintenance rules.

## Final checklist

Before submitting, confirm:

- The submitter has **Apps Management** write access.
- The publisher has a verified developer or business identity.
- The MCP server uses a public, production URL.
- Plugins with UI define a content security policy for the exact domains the
  component fetches from.
- Reviewer credentials work without MFA, email confirmation, SMS confirmation,
  or private-network access.
- Tool names, descriptions, schemas, and annotations match actual behavior.
- Every tool has accurate `readOnlyHint`, `openWorldHint`, and
  `destructiveHint` values.
- Tool responses don't include unnecessary personal data, auth secrets, debug
  payloads, internal identifiers, or undisclosed user-related fields.
- You tested the skills locally with the final file tree.
- Starter prompts show realistic user workflows.
- The submission includes five positive and three negative test cases.
- Privacy policy, terms, support, and website URLs are public and match the
  publisher identity.
