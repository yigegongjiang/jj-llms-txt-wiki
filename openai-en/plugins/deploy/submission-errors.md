# Plugin submission errors

Plugins submitted to the public directory are held to a higher standard than
plugins installed in a workspace. Directory submissions must pass the shared
package checks and the additional checks for listing fields, review materials,
MCP tools, skills, assets, and images. This reference also covers shared
package checks, such as app references, that can appear outside the submission
portal.

Use the error code returned during submission to find the matching requirement.
Errors block submission. Warnings don't block submission, but you should review
them before continuing.

Non-empty values can't contain only whitespace. Supported text excludes control
characters, Unicode line or paragraph separators, and unsupported invisible
formatting characters. HTTPS URLs must include a host and contain no embedded
credentials or unsupported characters.

## Final directory submission

A package can pass upload validation and still fail final directory submission.
Final submission uses stricter listing limits and checks MCP configuration,
skill scans, test cases, and policy attestations.

| Field             | Final submission rule                                                                                                                                                       |

Every plugin submission also requires:

- Passing safety and security scans for every bundled skill. Scans can take up
  to 2 hours.
- A verified developer or business identity and all required policy
  attestations.

For an MCP-backed plugin, final submission also requires:

- Website, support, privacy policy, and terms URLs that meet the rules above.
- A demo-recording URL that shows the main use cases and tools across supported
  platforms.
- Exactly five positive test cases, three negative test cases, and release
  notes.
- A production HTTPS MCP server URL, a completed domain-verification challenge,
  and a successful, current tool scan.
- Explicit `readOnlyHint`, `openWorldHint`, and `destructiveHint` values and a
  justification for each value on every MCP tool.
- Reviewer-ready demo credentials when the server uses OAuth.
- Screenshots only when the MCP server provides custom UI. If you add
  screenshots, provide one PNG or JPEG image for every starter prompt. Each
  screenshot must be exactly 706 pixels wide and 400–860 pixels tall.

## Archive errors

### Skills-only ZIP upload errors and warnings

**Skills only** uploads accept a plugin manifest and bundled skills. A changed
package name blocks an update; the other findings require confirmation.

| Name                                | Requirement                                                                                                                                               |

| `plugin_version_unchanged`          | A new release must use a different manifest `version`; reusing the published version requires confirmation.                                               |
| `mcp_configuration_excluded`        | Skills-only ZIP uploads must not include `mcpServers` or `.mcp.json`; MCP-backed plugins must use **With MCP**.                                           |
| `app_configuration_excluded`        | Skills-only ZIP uploads must not include `apps` or `.app.json`; plugins with app content must use **With MCP**.                                           |
| `screenshot_configuration_excluded` | Skills-only ZIP uploads must not include `interface.screenshots`; screenshots require **With MCP** and custom UI.                                         |

| `manifest_normalized`               | The portal saves the normalized manifest as `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`; changed fields require confirmation.                                             |
| `developer_name_defaulted`          | `author.name` and `interface.developerName` must match, or the selected verified identity is used for both after confirmation.                            |

## Listing and interface errors

The plugin manifest's `interface` object defines the public listing shown to
users. It lives in `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` and uses fields such as
`displayName` and `shortDescription`:

```json
{
  "interface": {
    "displayName": "Example Plugin",
    "shortDescription": "Summarize documents",
    "longDescription": "Summarize and organize documents.",
    "developerName": "Example",
    "category": "Productivity",
    "capabilities": ["Summarize documents"]
  }
}
```

The four listing URLs (website, privacy policy, terms, and support) are
optional for skills-only plugins and required for MCP-backed plugins. Their
length limit is 2,048 characters for package validation and 1,024 characters
for final directory submission.

## Skill agent metadata errors

A bundled skill can define its own `interface` in
`skills/<skill>/agents/openai.yaml`. This controls how the skill appears to
users and is separate from the plugin manifest's `interface`. Skill interface
fields use snake_case:

```yaml
interface:
  display_name: "Summarize documents"
  short_description: "Summarize a document"
  icon_small: "./assets/icon.png"
  default_prompt: "Summarize the selected document."
```

## App reference errors

The shared package checks validate `.app.json` when a plugin references apps.
The submission portal doesn't publish references to existing ChatGPT apps: a
**Skills only** upload removes `.app.json`, and an MCP-backed submission must
use **With MCP** and submit the MCP server directly.

For local or workspace packages, the top-level `apps` object maps each app
alias to an app entry.

## Package warnings

These warnings identify package content that validation ignores or normalizes.
They don't block submission. Review them to confirm the submitted plugin
contains the expected files and settings.

| Name                              | Requirement                                                                                                                                  |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `duplicate_app_reference`         | Each app ID in `.app.json` must be referenced once; duplicate references are treated as one app.                                             |
| `undeclared_app_manifest_ignored` | A root `.app.json` is imported only when the plugin-manifest `apps` field is set to `./.app.json`.                                           |
| `undeclared_mcp_manifest_ignored` | A root `.mcp.json` is imported only when the plugin-manifest `mcpServers` field is set to `./.mcp.json`.                                     |
| `skill_file_ignored`              | Files directly under `skills/` aren't imported as skills; each skill must be in a directory containing `SKILL.md`.                           |
| `skill_symlink_ignored`           | Symbolic links directly under `skills/` aren't imported as skills; each skill must be a real directory containing `SKILL.md`.                |
| `skill_frontmatter_adjusted`      | Skill `name` and `description` are normalized during import by trimming outer whitespace and collapsing internal whitespace.                 |
| `skill_metadata_ignored`          | Skill interface settings must use the `interface` mapping in `agents/openai.yaml`; `metadata` in `SKILL.md` doesn't configure the interface. |
