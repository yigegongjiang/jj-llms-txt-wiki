# UI guidelines

> For the complete documentation index, see [llms.txt](/llms.txt). Markdown versions of documentation pages are available by appending `.md` to the page URL.

## Overview

Optional plugin UI can extend what users can do without breaking the flow of
conversation. Use cards, carousels, fullscreen views, and other display modes
only when visual interaction improves the workflow.

## Design system

To design high-quality UI that feels native to ChatGPT, you can use the
[`@openai/apps-sdk-ui`](https://openai.github.io/apps-sdk-ui/) component
library.

It provides styling foundations with Tailwind, CSS variable design tokens, and a library of well-crafted, accessible components.

The component library is optional. It provides a faster way to build
components that match the ChatGPT design system.

## Display modes

Display modes are the surfaces developers use to create experiences for apps in ChatGPT. They allow partners to show content and actions that feel native to conversation. Each mode is designed for a specific type of interaction, from quick confirmations to immersive workflows.

Using these consistently helps experiences stay basic and predictable.

### Inline

The inline display mode appears directly in the flow of the conversation. Inline surfaces currently always appear before the generated model response. Every app initially appears inline.

![Examples of inline cards and carousels in ChatGPT](https://developers.openai.com/images/apps-sdk/inline_display_mode.png)

**Layout**

- **Icon & tool call**: A label with the app name and icon.
- **Inline display**: A lightweight display with app content embedded above the model response.
- **Follow-up**: A short, model-generated response shown after the widget to suggest edits, next steps, or related actions. Avoid content that is redundant with the card.

#### Inline card

Lightweight, single-purpose widgets embedded directly in conversation. They provide quick confirmations, basic actions, or visual aids.

**When to use**

- A single action or decision (for example, confirm a booking).
- Small amounts of structured data (for example, a map, order summary, or quick status).
- A fully self-contained widget or tool (for example, an audio player or a score card).

**Layout**

![Diagram of inline cards](https://developers.openai.com/images/apps-sdk/inline_card_layout.png)

- **Title**: Include a title if your card is document-based or contains items with a parent element, like songs in a playlist.
- **Expand**: Use to open a fullscreen display mode if the card contains rich media or interactivity like a map or an interactive diagram.
- **Show more**: Use to disclose additional items if multiple results are presented in a list.
- **Edit controls**: Provide inline support for app responses without overwhelming the conversation.
- **Primary actions**: Limit to two actions, placed at bottom of card. Actions should perform either a conversation turn or a tool call.

**Interaction**

![Diagram of interaction patterns for inline cards](https://developers.openai.com/images/apps-sdk/inline_card_interaction.png)

Cards support basic direct interaction.

- **States**: Edits made are persisted.
- **Basic direct edits**: If appropriate, inline editable text allows users to make quick edits without needing to prompt the model.
- **Dynamic layout**: Card layout can expand its height to match its contents up to the height of the mobile display area.

**Rules of thumb**

- **Limit primary actions per card**: Support up to two actions maximum, with one primary CTA and one optional secondary CTA.
- **No deep navigation or multiple views within a card.** Cards should not contain multiple drill-ins, tabs, or deeper navigation. Consider splitting these into separate cards or tool actions.
- **No nested scrolling**. Cards should auto fit their content and prevent internal scrolling.
- **No duplicate inputs**. Don’t replicate ChatGPT features in a card.

![Examples of patterns to avoid in inline cards](https://developers.openai.com/images/apps-sdk/inline_card_rules.png)

#### Inline carousel

A set of cards presented side-by-side, letting users quickly scan and choose from multiple options.

**When to use**

- Presenting a small list of similar items (for example, restaurants, playlists, events).
- Items have more visual content and metadata than will fit in basic rows.

**Layout**

![Diagram of inline carousel](https://developers.openai.com/images/apps-sdk/inline_carousel_layout.png)

- **Image**: Items should always include an image or visual.
- **Title**: Carousel items should typically include a title to explain the content.
- **Metadata**: Use metadata to show the most important and relevant information about the item in the context of the response. Avoid showing more than two lines of text.
- **Badge**: Use the badge to show supporting context where appropriate.
- **Actions**: Provide a single clear CTA per item whenever possible.

**Rules of thumb**

- Keep to **3–8 items per carousel** for readability.
- Reduce metadata to the most relevant details, with three lines max.
- Each card may have a single, optional CTA (for example, “Book” or “Play”).
- Use consistent visual hierarchy across cards.

### fullscreen

Immersive experiences that expand beyond the inline card, giving users space for multi-step workflows or deeper exploration. The ChatGPT composer remains overlaid, allowing users to continue “talking to the app” through natural conversation in the context of the fullscreen view.

**When to use**

- Rich tasks that cannot be reduced to a single card (for example, an interactive map with pins, a rich editing canvas, or an interactive diagram).
- Browsing detailed content (for example, real estate listings, menus).

**Layout**

![Diagram of fullscreen](https://developers.openai.com/images/apps-sdk/fullscreen_layout.png)

- **System close**: Closes the sheet or view.
- **fullscreen view**: Content area.
- **Composer**: ChatGPT’s native composer, allowing the user to follow up in the context of the fullscreen view.

**Interaction**

![Interaction patterns for fullscreen](https://developers.openai.com/images/apps-sdk/fullscreen_interaction_a.png)

- **Chat sheet**: Maintain conversational context alongside the fullscreen surface.
- **Thinking**: The composer input “shimmers” to show that a response is streaming.
- **Response**: When the model completes its response, an ephemeral, truncated snippet displays above the composer. Tapping it opens the chat sheet.

**Rules of thumb**

- **Design your UX to work with the system composer**. The composer is always present in fullscreen, so make sure your experience supports conversational prompts that can trigger tool calls and feel natural for users.
- **Use fullscreen to deepen engagement**, not to replicate your native app wholesale.

### Picture-in-picture (PiP)

A persistent floating window inside ChatGPT optimized for ongoing or live sessions like games or videos. PiP remains visible while the conversation continues, and it can update dynamically in response to user prompts.

**When to use**

- **Activities that run in parallel with conversation**, such as a game, live collaboration, quiz, or learning session.
- **Situations where the PiP widget can react to chat input**, for example continuing a game round or refreshing live data based on a user request.

**Interaction**

![Interaction patterns for picture-in-picture](https://developers.openai.com/images/apps-sdk/fullscreen_interaction.png)

- **Activated:** On scroll, the PiP window stays fixed to the top of the display area
- **Pinned:** The PiP remains fixed until the user dismisses it or the session ends.
- **Session ends:** The PiP returns to an inline position and scrolls away.

**Rules of thumb**

- **Ensure the PiP state can update or respond** when users interact through the system composer.
- **Close PiP automatically** when the session ends.
- **Do not overload PiP with controls or static content** better suited for inline or fullscreen.

## Visual design guidelines

A consistent look and feel helps partner-built tools feel like a natural part of the ChatGPT platform. Visual guidelines support clarity, usability, and accessibility, while still leaving room for brand expression in the right places.

These principles outline how to use color, type, spacing, and imagery in ways that preserve system clarity while giving partners space to differentiate their service.

### Why this matters

Visual and UX consistency helps improve the overall user experience of using apps in ChatGPT. By following these guidelines, partners can present their tools in a way that feels consistent to users and delivers value without distraction.

### Color

System-defined palettes help ensure actions and responses always feel consistent with the ChatGPT platform. Partners can add branding through accents, icons, or inline imagery, but should not redefine system colors.

![Color palette](https://developers.openai.com/images/apps-sdk/color.png)

**Rules of thumb**

- Use system colors for text, icons, and spatial elements like dividers.
- Partner brand accents such as logos or icons should not override backgrounds or text colors.
- Avoid custom gradients or patterns that break ChatGPT’s minimal look.
- Use brand accent colors on primary buttons inside app display modes.

![Example color usage](https://developers.openai.com/images/apps-sdk/color_usage_1.png)

_Use brand colors on accents and badges. Don't change text colors or other core component styles._

![Example color usage](https://developers.openai.com/images/apps-sdk/color_usage_2.png)

_Don't apply colors to backgrounds in text areas._

### Typography

ChatGPT uses platform-native system fonts (SF Pro on iOS, a sans-serif font on Android) to ensure readability and accessibility across devices.

![Typography](https://developers.openai.com/images/apps-sdk/typography.png)

**Rules of thumb**

- Always inherit the system font stack, respecting system sizing rules for headings, body text, and captions.
- Use partner styling such as bold, italic, or highlights only within content areas, not for structural UI.
- Limit variation in font size as much as possible, preferring body and body-small sizes.

![Example typography](https://developers.openai.com/images/apps-sdk/typography_usage.png)

_Don't use custom fonts, even in full screen modes. Use system font variables wherever possible._

### Spacing & layout

Consistent margins, padding, and alignment keep partner content scannable and predictable inside conversation.

![Spacing & layout](https://developers.openai.com/images/apps-sdk/spacing.png)

**Rules of thumb**

- Use system grid spacing for cards, collections, and inspector panels.
- Keep padding consistent and avoid cramming or edge-to-edge text.
- Respect system specified corner rounds when possible to keep shapes consistent.
- Maintain visual hierarchy with headline, supporting text, and CTA in a clear order.

### Icons & imagery

System iconography provides visual clarity, while partner logos and images help users recognize brand context.

![Icons](https://developers.openai.com/images/apps-sdk/icons.png)

**Rules of thumb**

- Use either system icons or custom iconography that fits within ChatGPT's visual world—monochromatic and outlined.
- Do not include your logo as part of the response. ChatGPT will always append your logo and app name before the widget is rendered.
- All imagery must follow enforced aspect ratios to avoid distortion.

![Icons & imagery](https://developers.openai.com/images/apps-sdk/iconography.png)

### Accessibility

Every partner experience should be usable by the widest possible audience.
Accessibility should be a core consideration when you are building apps for ChatGPT.

**Rules of thumb**

- Text and background must maintain a minimum contrast ratio (WCAG AA).
- Provide alt text for all images.
- Support text resizing without breaking layouts.
