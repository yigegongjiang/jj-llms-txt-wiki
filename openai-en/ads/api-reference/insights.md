# Insights

> For the complete documentation index, see [llms.txt](/llms.txt). Markdown versions of documentation pages are available by appending `.md` to the page URL.

## Endpoints

Use one of the four `GET` endpoints for general delivery insights. Each returns
the same top-level response shape, with IDs, metadata, and metrics appropriate
to its scope.

- `GET /ad_account/insights`
- `GET /campaigns/{campaign_id}/insights`
- `GET /ad_groups/{ad_group_id}/insights`
- `GET /ads/{ad_id}/insights`

Use `POST /conversions/insights` for goal conversion totals and optional attributed event details.

## Conversion insights

Use `POST /v1/conversions/insights` to retrieve campaign goal conversion counts and, optionally, attributed standard and custom event metrics. Goal counts include click-through and view-through conversions within the selected reporting windows. Events do not need to be campaign goals to appear in the optional event details.

### Request body

| Field                                  | Values and behavior                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| `time_ranges`                          | Required array containing exactly one JSON-encoded time-range object. Use full days in the account's timezone, with an exclusive end, covering at most 365 days.                                                                                                                                                             |
| `time_granularity`                     | `none` (default) for period totals, or `daily`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `entity_ids`                           | Nonempty list of entity IDs at the selected aggregation level. Required when `group_by_entity` is `true`; omit when `group_by_entity` is `false` to report across the account.                                                                                                                                               |
| `group_by_entity`                      | Defaults to `true`. Set to `false` to combine the selected entities for each date or breakdown, using the ad account ID as `entity_id`.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `breakdown`                            | `country`, `device`, or `null` (default).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `attribution_time_basis`               | `ad_event_time` (default) groups and filters by the attributed ad interaction's date; `conversion_time` uses the conversion date and has limited non-goal event coverage.                                                                                                                                                    |
| `attribution_window_days`              | Click window: `7`, `14`, or `30`. Omitted or `null` defaults to `30`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `view_through_attribution_window_days` | View window: `0` to exclude views, or `1` for one day. Omitted or `null` defaults to `1`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `include`                              | Omit or send `[]` for summary rows only. Send `["attributed_events"]` to add nested event details without changing the reporting clock, windows, or metric values for matching summary rows.                                                                                                                                 |
| `event_names`                          | Optional selector requiring `include: ["attributed_events"]`. Omit for all events, or provide 1–500 names containing at least one non-whitespace character of up to 256 characters each. Names match exactly, and the API removes duplicates. This filters nested details only; goal counts and summary sales are unchanged. |
| `include_zero_rows`                    | Defaults to `true`. With the event expansion and `false`, retain rows with a nonzero goal count, summary sales amount, or selected event count. A sales-bearing row remains present even when its selected event details are empty.                                                                                          |

The click and view defaults apply independently. These options select the report's attribution windows; they do not change campaign conversion goals or optimization settings. If an outcome is eligible for both click-through and view-through attribution, the click takes precedence.

An `event_names` entry must be configured in the account's conversion event settings, including archived settings, or present in its published received-event history. Validation covers the account independently of the requested entities and dates. Newly received events without conversion settings can be selected after their history is published; retained history is not an all-time event registry. A recognized event can have no attributed activity in the requested report.

Unknown names, an empty `event_names` array, `null`, or an event selector without the expansion return HTTP 400. Unsupported reporting windows also return HTTP 400.

### Response

The response contains `object: "list"`, `data`, `count`, and `account_currency`. `count` is the number of summary rows in `data`, not the number of conversions or nested events.

| Summary field                                           | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `entity_id`                                             | Entity ID, or the ad account ID when `group_by_entity` is `false`.                                                                                                                |
| `date`, `country`, `device`                             | Present when applicable to the requested daily granularity or breakdown.                                                                                                          |
| `conversions`                                           | Goal conversions from clicks plus views within the selected windows.                                                                                                              |
| `click_through_conversions`, `view_through_conversions` | Goal counts by attribution type. The view count is zero when the view window is `0`.                                                                                              |
| `order_created_attributed_sales`                        | Attributed purchase value across goal and non-goal `order_created` events, returned as an unrounded decimal string or `null` when unavailable.                                    |
| `order_created_attributed_sales_currency`               | Currency for summary sales.                                                                                                                                                       |
| `attributed_events`                                     | Present only when requested in `include`. Contains event metrics for the summary row's entity, date, and breakdown. An empty array means no matching event details were returned. |

Each nested event includes `entity_id`, `event_name`, `event_kind` (`standard` or `custom`), `attributed_event_count`, `attributed_event_value_amount`, `attributed_event_value_count`, and `attributed_event_value_currency`. Event counts include goal and non-goal activity. Reporting event rows also provide click/view counts and `conversion_event_setting_breakdowns` for matched campaign goals; applicable date and segment fields identify the reporting scope. Unavailable event amounts and currencies are `null`.

Non-goal-only rows can have positive event counts or sales and zero `conversions`. A recognized but inactive event selection can yield `attributed_events: []` on a retained summary row. Empty event details do not confirm that historical data has finished processing.

Responses are limited to 2,000 summary rows and, when expanded, 2,000 event rows in total. Each event's goal-setting breakdown is also limited to 2,000 entries. Exceeding a limit returns HTTP 413 rather than a partial result. This endpoint has no pagination cursor: reduce the entity list, split the report into non-overlapping date ranges, or select fewer event names when event details exceed the limit.

### Campaign example

This request returns campaign goal totals for September 1–7, 2026, in an account using `America/New_York`. It uses the default ad-event time basis and 30-day click / 1-day view windows.

```bash
curl -sS -X POST "https://api.ads.openai.com/v1/conversions/insights" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_ADS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{
    "aggregation_level": "campaign",
    "time_ranges": ["{\"type\":\"unix_range\",\"start\":\"1788235200\",\"end\":\"1788840000\"}"],
    "entity_ids": ["cmpn_123"]
  }'
```

Replace the sample campaign ID with your own. This illustrative response has 7 click-through and 3 view-through goal conversions, for a total of 10:

```json
{
  "object": "list",
  "account_currency": "USD",
  "data": [
    {
      "entity_id": "cmpn_123",
      "conversions": 10,
      "click_through_conversions": 7,
      "view_through_conversions": 3,
      "order_created_attributed_sales": "0",
      "order_created_attributed_sales_currency": "USD"
    }
  ],
  "count": 1
}
```

`fields[]` uses canonical names, but many response fields serialize as flat
wire keys, such as `campaign.id` to `campaign_id`,
`metadata.readable_time` to `readable_time`, and `product.feed_id` to
`product_feed_id`.

### Sorts

| Parameter          | Value shape                                             | Rules                                           | Example                                    |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `sort[]`           | JSON-encoded objects                                    | Repeat `sort[]` with `field` and `direction`.   | `{"field":"ad.clicks","direction":"desc"}` |
| `sort[].field`     | One canonical sort key from [Terminology](#terminology) | Use a sort key valid for the current row shape. | `ad.clicks` or `product.title`             |
| `sort[].direction` | One `sort[].direction` value                            | Use `asc` or `desc`.                            | `desc`                                     |

### Segments

#### Segment rules

| Parameter                        | Rules                                                                                   |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `segments[]`                     | Add one optional breakdown dimension for enabled ad accounts.                           |
| `time_granularity`               | Segmented requests support `none`, `daily`, and `monthly`.                              |
| Segment fields                   | Request fields only for the selected segment.                                           |
| `override_segment_group_order[]` | Include the row's `aggregation_level` and the requested segment exactly once, in order. |

#### Product example

| Goal                 | Request shape                                                                                             |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Product breakdown    | Add `segments[]=product` to an `ad_account`, `campaign`, `ad_group`, or `ad` aggregation level.           |
| Product fields       | Project `product.*` fields from [Terminology](#terminology).                                              |
| Product-first rows   | Set `override_segment_group_order[]=product`, then `override_segment_group_order[]=<aggregation_level>`.  |
| Zero-impression rows | Add `includes[]=zero_impression_products`; see [Includes](#includes) for required order and availability. |

#### Platform breakdown

Add `segments[]=platform` to split delivery metrics by ChatGPT app or web
browser. Include `fields[]=platform` to return the platform value in each row.
Platform is a separate dimension from the `device` breakdown.

| Response value | Platform    |
| -------------- | ----------- |
| `android_app`  | Android app |
| `android_web`  | Android web |
| `desktop_web`  | Desktop web |
| `ios_app`      | iOS app     |
| `ios_web`      | iOS web     |
| `web`          | Web         |

Historical `web` rows keep combined web totals. They aren't split
retroactively into Android web, Desktop web, or iOS web rows.

A `platform` filter with `IN` and `web` includes all web platforms: `web`,
`android_web`, `desktop_web`, and `ios_web`. For example:

```json
{ "field": "platform", "operator": "IN", "value": ["web"] }
```

Use `android_web`, `desktop_web`, or `ios_web` to filter to specific web
platforms. These filters don't include historical `web` rows. Platform segments
support delivery metrics; conversions aren't supported.

To choose where a campaign can deliver, see
[Platform Targeting](https://developers.openai.com/ads/platform-targeting).

### Includes

`includes[]` expands the result set with supported zero-metric rows. It does
not change endpoint scope or `aggregation_level`.

| Include                    | Works when                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Adds                                                                       |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `zero_impression_items`    | Default entity grouping only: do not send `segments[]`.                                                                                                                                                                                            | Entity rows that had zero impressions in the requested window.             |
| `zero_impression_products` | Product reporting only: the ad account has product segments and zero-impression products enabled, `segments[]=product`, `override_segment_group_order[]=product` first, and any `filters[]` use only product fields, entity ID fields, or metrics. | Configured product rows that had zero impressions in the requested window. |

## Examples



This request scopes to one ad account, groups rows by campaign, and returns one
bucket per day. Because `aggregation_level=campaign`, each data row has a
`campaign_id` instead of an `ad_id`.

  "has_more": false
}
```





This uses the same ad-account scope as the previous example, but changes
`aggregation_level` from `campaign` to `ad`. The result now has one row per ad
per day, so campaign totals can fan out into multiple ad rows.

`filters[]` removes rows that do not match `campaign.id`. `sort[]` ranks the
remaining ads by clicks, and `limit=1` keeps only the top row on the page.

For ad accounts with segmented insights and zero-impression product expansion
enabled, use a product segment when you need product rows within the selected
entity level. This request groups products first, then the ad account, so the
response can include one configured product row even when that product had zero
impressions.

Synthetic zero-product rows omit unavailable metric fields from the response.
