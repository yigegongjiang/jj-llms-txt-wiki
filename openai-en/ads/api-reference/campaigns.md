## Create a campaign

Create a campaign for the current ad account. The Ads belonging to a campaign will only show between the defined start and end time, and only in the locations specified in campaign targeting.

For region and DMA targeting, see [Campaign Targeting](https://developers.openai.com/ads/campaign-targeting).

### Defaults

If you omit `start_time`, the campaign will begin delivering immediately. If you omit location targeting, the campaign can target all available locations.

Note that time and currency fields will respect your account-set timezone and currency defaults.

### Create a conversion-optimized campaign

To use oCPC, set `bidding_type` to `conversions` and pass exactly one active
standard conversion event setting from the current ad account. The event
setting must connect to one active conversion source. Custom event settings
cannot be optimization goals.

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.ads.openai.com/v1/campaigns" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_ADS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Acme purchases",
    "status": "paused",
    "budget": {
      "lifetime_spend_limit_micros": 250000000
    },
    "bidding_type": "conversions",
    "conversion_event_setting_ids": ["ces_123"]
  }'
```

Conversion bidding must be enabled for the ad account. Product-feed campaigns
can use oCPC during the open beta. Use the same endpoint, set `mode` to
`product_feed`, and include the linked `product_feed_id`. You cannot change the
campaign objective or selected conversion event after creation. For the complete
setup flow, including the required ad-group bid configuration, see
[Conversion-Optimized Campaigns](https://developers.openai.com/ads/conversion-optimized-campaigns),
[Product Feeds](https://developers.openai.com/ads/product-feeds), and [API Partner
Setup](https://developers.openai.com/ads/api-partner-setup).

## Retrieve a campaign

Fetch one campaign by ID.

`GET /campaigns/{campaign_id}`

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.ads.openai.com/v1/campaigns/cmpn_101" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_ADS_API_KEY"
```

## Update a campaign

Update a campaign with `POST`, not `PATCH` or `PUT`.

`POST /campaigns/{campaign_id}`

All fields are optional on update. If you include `budget`, send the full
budget object. `description`, `start_time`, `end_time`, and `targeting` can be
set to `null` to clear them. `status` accepts `active`, `paused`, or
`archived`. You cannot update `bidding_type`. For a conversion-optimized
campaign, you also cannot update `conversion_event_setting_ids`.

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.ads.openai.com/v1/campaigns/cmpn_101" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_ADS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "description": "Updated launch window and budget.",
    "status": "paused",
    "budget": {
      "lifetime_spend_limit_micros": 30000000
    }
  }'
```

## Change state with dedicated actions

The Ads API also exposes explicit state transitions. Each endpoint returns the
updated campaign object. Paused campaigns won't deliver ads to customers. Only archive objects you have no further use for, as archiving isn't reversible.

- `POST /campaigns/{campaign_id}/activate`
- `POST /campaigns/{campaign_id}/pause`
- `POST /campaigns/{campaign_id}/archive`

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.ads.openai.com/v1/campaigns/cmpn_101/pause" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_ADS_API_KEY"
```

```json
