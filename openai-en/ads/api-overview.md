Use the Advertiser API to create and manage campaigns, ad groups, ads, product feeds, conversion tracking, and reporting in your own application or for automating workflows.




## Getting Started

You will need an [ad account](https://ads.openai.com/) and an Advertiser API key. You can create your Advertiser API key within the [Settings page](https://ads.openai.com/settings) in Ads Manager. Store API keys securely on your server.

Examples throughout this guide will use a placeholder for the Advertiser API key and sample IDs such as `cmpn_123`, `adgrp_123`, and `ad_123` in requests. Replace these placeholders with real values returned by your requests.

API partners can follow [API Partner Setup](https://developers.openai.com/ads/api-partner-setup). For another end-to-end example, see the [Quickstart](https://developers.openai.com/ads/api-quickstart).

### Request conventions

Use the following base URL for API requests. Provide your API key in the Authorization header when making requests.

| Convention     | What to use                  |
| -------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Base URL       | `https://api.ads.openai.com` |
| Authentication | `Authorization: Bearer …`    |

On supported create endpoints, you may send an `Idempotency-Key`. Reuse that key and the same request when retrying the same creation; use a new key for a new resource. This prevents a network retry from creating a duplicate.

### Verify your API key

Retrieve your ad account to verify the key:

```bash
curl -G "https://api.ads.openai.com/v1/ad_account" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${OPENAI_ADS_API_KEY}"
```

Confirm that the response contains information about your account. Inspect the currency, timezone, account status, and reviews before creating a campaign. An account marked `active` may still have an outstanding review.

### Next steps

Read through the [Campaign Structure](#campaign-structure) section and then follow the steps in [Your First Campaign](#your-first-campaign).






## Campaign Structure

An ad account contains campaigns. Each campaign contains ad groups, and each ad group contains ads. Configure each setting at the level that owns it. Use separate campaigns when you need separate budgets, objectives, or targeting. Use ad groups for different bid configurations, context hints, or product selections. Keep related creative variations together where those settings are shared.

```text
Ad account
└── Campaign
    └── Ad group
        └── Ad
```

| Level      | What you configure                                                                                                  | Example                       |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Ad account | Advertiser branding, currency, timezone, account access, spend limits                                               | Acme's US advertising account |
| Campaign   | Objective, budget, schedule, geographic and platform targeting, audience inclusion and exclusion, conversion events | US spring sales               |
| Ad group   | Bid strategy, context hints, audience bid multipliers, product set                                                  | Trail running products        |
| Ad         | Creative, image or product template, destination URL                                                                | A running-shoe ad             |

## Your First Campaign

Let's create a paused campaign, an ad group, and an ad. This example creates a clicks campaign with a fixed bid. The budget and bid are illustrative USD amounts. Use values appropriate to your account's currency and your advertising plan.

### 1. Create the campaign

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.ads.openai.com/v1/campaigns" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${OPENAI_ADS_API_KEY}" \
  -H "Idempotency-Key: first-campaign-001" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Spring launch",
    "status": "paused",
    "bidding_type": "clicks",
    "budget": {
      "daily_spend_limit_micros": 50000000
    },
    "targeting": {
      "locations": {
        "countries": [
          "US"
        ]
      }
    }
  }'
```

Save the returned `id`. Use it in place of `cmpn_123` below. The example daily budget is $50 for a USD account.

### 2. Create the ad group

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.ads.openai.com/v1/ad_groups" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${OPENAI_ADS_API_KEY}" \
  -H "Idempotency-Key: first-ad-group-001" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "campaign_id": "cmpn_123",
    "name": "Trail running",
    "status": "paused",
    "context_hints": [
      "Trail running shoes for rocky terrain"
    ],
    "bidding_config": {
      "billing_event_type": "click",
      "strategy": "fixed_bid",
      "max_bid_micros": 2000000
    }
  }'
```

Save the returned ad-group ID. The example maximum bid is $2 per click for a USD account.

### 3. Upload a creative image

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.ads.openai.com/v1/upload" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${OPENAI_ADS_API_KEY}" \
  -F "file=@/path/to/product-image.png"
```

Use an image at least 640 × 640 pixels. Save the returned `file_id`. You'll use this image in the ad.

### 4. Create the ad

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.ads.openai.com/v1/ads" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${OPENAI_ADS_API_KEY}" \
  -H "Idempotency-Key: first-ad-001" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "ad_group_id": "adgrp_123",
    "name": "Trail shoe launch",
    "status": "paused",
    "creative": {
      "type": "chat_card",
      "title": "Find your next trail shoe",
      "body": "Explore shoes made for your next outdoor run.",
      "target_url": "https://example.com/trail-shoes",
      "file_id": "file_123"
    }
  }'
```

Replace the `target_url` with your real, accessible landing page. Save the returned ad ID. Creating an ad submits its creative for review.

### 5. Preview and inspect

Check the creative, destination, review status, account reviews, targeting, and budget. A preview shows appearance; it does not confirm serving eligibility.

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.ads.openai.com/v1/ads/ad_123/preview" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${OPENAI_ADS_API_KEY}"
```

```bash
curl -G "https://api.ads.openai.com/v1/ads/ad_123" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${OPENAI_ADS_API_KEY}" \
  --data-urlencode 'include[]=serving_issues'
```

### 6. Activate when ready

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.ads.openai.com/v1/ads/ad_123/activate" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${OPENAI_ADS_API_KEY}"
```

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.ads.openai.com/v1/ad_groups/adgrp_123/activate" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${OPENAI_ADS_API_KEY}"
```

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.ads.openai.com/v1/campaigns/cmpn_123/activate" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${OPENAI_ADS_API_KEY}"
```

Activation enables delivery when the remaining requirements are satisfied. Use Insights to monitor results and Serving Issues if delivery does not begin.

## Rate limits

The Advertiser API enforces limits by both ad account and IP address:

| Scope        | Limit                     |
| ------------ | ------------------------- |
| Per endpoint | 600 requests per minute   |
| Overall      | 1,200 requests per minute |

Requests must stay within both the ad-account and IP-address limits.

Bulk job creation has a separate limit of 10 requests per 10 seconds for each
ad account. See [Bulk API limits](https://developers.openai.com/ads/bulk-api#limits-and-retries).
