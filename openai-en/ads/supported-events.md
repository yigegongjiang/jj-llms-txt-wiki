`app_installed` and `app_opened` are available through the Conversions API
only. Send them with `action_source` set to `mobile_app`. They are not
supported by the JavaScript Pixel currently.

Use `page_viewed` for page loads. Use `contents_viewed` when a user views a
specific product or content item, including interactions that happen after the
page has loaded.

## Event data shapes

All event data objects must include a `type` field that matches the event you
send. If you include an `amount`, also include a `currency`. Send monetary
values as integers in the standard ISO 4217 minor unit for the currency code
you provide, for example `12999` for $129.99 with `currency: "USD"`.
