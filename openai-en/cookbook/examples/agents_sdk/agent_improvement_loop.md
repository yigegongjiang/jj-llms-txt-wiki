# Build an Agent Improvement Loop with Traces, Evals, and Codex

> For the complete documentation index, see [llms.txt](/llms.txt). Markdown versions of documentation pages are available by appending `.md` to the page URL.

This notebook builds an improvement flywheel for an agent. We start with real traces, add human and model feedback, turn that feedback into evals, and use the resulting evidence to propose the next harness changes for Codex to implement.

You will:

- Create an OpenAI Agents SDK-backed financial analyst
- Run it on synthetic company data and capture traces
- Add example human feedback and LLM-generated feedback from those runs
- Turn that feedback into [Promptfoo](https://www.promptfoo.dev/) evals that can be rerun later
- Use [HALO](https://github.com/context-labs/halo) to rank the next harness changes and write a Codex-ready handoff

In this notebook, the **harness** is the full contract around the model, including instructions, tools, routing, output requirements, and validation checks.

The flywheel preserves what you learn from each run. Traces show what happened, feedback explains what mattered, evals make those expectations reusable, and Codex can act on the resulting change set.


## What you will build

![Agent improvement loop flywheel](https://developers.openai.com/cookbook/assets/images/agent-improvement-loop-flywheel.svg)

By the end, you will have:

1. An OpenAI Agents SDK-backed financial analyst that reviews a fictional company's diligence materials across five traced runs
2. Human and LLM-generated feedback over those same traces
3. An automatically generated Promptfoo eval suite
4. A Promptfoo validation gate over the current agent behavior
5. A HALO optimization pass over the traces, feedback, and eval results
6. A developer-facing handoff to Codex so it can implement the recommended harness changes

The agent supports acquisition diligence for a fictional company. It reviews financial exports, customer data, contracts, security notes, board materials, and management narratives, then answers diligence questions with citations and reviewable artifacts.

The loop writes one file that carries the work forward: the generated `codex_handoff.md` file under `ARTIFACT_DIR`. It contains the full HALO diagnosis, the ranked recommendations, the evidence behind them, and the implementation guidance Codex needs for the next harness update.

The degree of automation is up to the developer. You can use the loop to propose a reviewed change set, or connect it to a workflow that opens, merges, and deploys pull requests automatically. A common starting point is a reviewed loop, where the system proposes the change set and a developer approves the diff before merge. As the eval gate becomes more trusted, the same handoff can support deeper automation. The core workflow is the same in either case: traces plus human and model feedback become concrete harness changes instead of remaining disconnected comments.

Compared with examples that stop at traces or evals, this notebook keeps traces, reviewer judgment, generated evals, optimization, and implementation handoff inside one runnable improvement loop.


## Prerequisites

Run this notebook from the repository root after installing the Python dependencies used by the example:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install openai openai-agents halo-engine
```

Promptfoo runs through `npx`, so you also need Node.js with `npx` available on your path.

Set an API key before running the notebook:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=...
```

The example is intentionally live-only. The trace generation, model critique, eval generation, validation, and optimization steps all use fresh model outputs so the notebook demonstrates the actual loop rather than a scripted preview. The next cell exposes the model choices in one place so you can trade quality for cost by substituting cheaper models if desired.

With the default five traces, budget about 20 minutes for a full run, though model latency and network conditions will move that up or down. The longest sections are usually Step 3, which runs the traced agent calls, and Step 7, where HALO analyzes the full loop. The feedback, eval-generation, and Promptfoo cells also make live calls, but are typically shorter. Long-running cells print progress or elapsed time as they work.

```

## Step 1. Create synthetic company data

The notebook creates fictional diligence materials for a company that might be reviewed during an acquisition. The data mixes structured exports with narrative markdown documents so the agent has to decide which sources deserve more weight.

### Narrative markdown files in the synthetic data

| File | Why it is included |
| --- | --- |
| `overview.md` | Management's top-level company summary |
| `product_strategy.md` | Roadmap context plus an unvalidated NRR estimate |
| `go_to_market.md` | Sales-motion context that should be checked against pipeline data |
| `board_deck.md` | A polished management narrative that can conflict with structured exports |
| `financials/revenue_recognition_notes.md` | Accounting context for launch-stage ARR treatment |
| `legal/contracts_summary.md` | Contract-level risk context |
| `legal/open_issues.md` | Open legal matters that should remain visible |
| `security/security_overview.md` | Security posture and certification wording |
| `sales/security_faq.md` | Sales-facing security language that may overstate the evidence |
| `hr/org_chart.md` | Operating context for leadership and staffing |
| `sales/pipeline_notes.md` | Qualitative pipeline commentary |
| `notes/qa_log.md` | Diligence questions and unresolved follow-ups |

The example generates the synthetic company data at runtime so it stays self-contained while still giving the agent a realistic mix of structured exports and narrative documents to analyze.


### Define the synthetic source files

The next collapsed cell contains the source documents used to build the fictional company data.

### Materialize the synthetic data

Write the source files to disk, add a manifest, and inspect the generated dataset.


```python
def write_workspace_file(path: Path, content: str) -> None:
    path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
    path.write_text(dedent(content).strip() + "\n", encoding="utf-8")


def generate_acquisition_diligence_workspace() -> Path:
    """Create the synthetic acquisition-diligence workspace directly from notebook data."""
    dataroom = ARTIFACT_DIR / "synthetic_dataroom"
    shutil.rmtree(dataroom, ignore_errors=True)
    for relative_path, content in WORKSPACE_FILES.items():
        write_workspace_file(dataroom / relative_path, content)
    manifest = {
        "company_name": "FictionalCorp XYZ",
        "scenario": "adversarial_diligence",
        "files": sorted(str(path.relative_to(dataroom)) for path in dataroom.rglob("*") if path.is_file()),
    }
    write_workspace_file(dataroom / "manifest.json", json.dumps(manifest, indent=2))
    return dataroom


dataset = generate_acquisition_diligence_workspace()
files = sorted(str(path.relative_to(dataset)) for path in dataset.rglob("*") if path.is_file())
print(f"Dataset created: {len(files)} files")
```

```text
Dataset created: 24 files
```

## Step 2. Define the Agents SDK-backed analyst

The example agent performs acquisition diligence on a fictional SaaS company being reviewed as a possible acquisition target. The case materials contain both structured exports and management narratives. Some sources agree, some conflict, and some important claims are only partially supported. That gives us a realistic reason to improve the harness over time.

The agent answers questions for an investment team using only the supplied company data. It should prefer structured financial evidence over narrative summaries when they disagree, preserve uncertainty when evidence is missing, and leave behind artifacts that another reviewer can inspect.

The OpenAI Agents SDK provides the managed runner, sandbox execution, model settings, and tracing hooks this workflow needs. Together, the prompt, tools, routing rules, output requirements, and validation checks form the current **agent harness**.

### Artifacts generated by the agent

| Artifact | Why the agent writes it |
| --- | --- |
| `summary_answer.md` | The concise answer returned to the user |
| `investment_memo.md` | A fuller review artifact for diligence readers |
| `risk_register.json` | Structured risks with evidence that downstream systems can inspect |
| `open_questions.md` | Missing evidence or unresolved questions that should stay visible |
| `citations.json` | A machine-readable link from claims to source files |
| `evidence_table.csv` | A tabular audit trail of claims and supporting sources |

These artifacts keep the work reviewable by preserving supporting evidence, unresolved questions, and required files alongside the final answer.

### Failure modes to watch for

This notebook is designed to surface failures such as:

- Treating management narrative as an official metric when the structured exports disagree
- Reporting an unsupported NRR estimate as if finance had validated it
- Collapsing parent-account concentration into a weaker legal-entity view
- Saying “SOC 2 complete” when the evidence only supports Type I
- Producing a polished answer while leaving citations, risk files, or evidence artifacts incomplete


### Define the harness schema

Start with small data structures for the model settings and promoted agent configuration. These make the harness explicit so later optimization can target more than prompt wording.


```python

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class ModelSettings:
    agent_model: str
    reasoning_effort: str


@dataclass(frozen=True)
class AgentConfig:
    version: str
    system_prompt: str
    model_settings: ModelSettings
    tool_policy: dict[str, Any]
    eval_metadata: dict[str, Any]
    path: Path = field(default_factory=lambda: Path("notebook_defined_agent_config"))

    @property
    def required_artifacts(self) -> list[str]:
        return self.tool_policy["required_artifacts"]

    def build_instructions(self) -> str:
        return "\n\n".join([
            self.system_prompt,
            format_policy_section("Tool policy", self.tool_policy),
            f"Runtime config:\n- Config version: `{self.version}`.\n- Treat this config as the promoted runtime contract.\n- Do not modify the runtime config during the run.",
        ]) + "\n"


def format_policy_section(title: str, policy: dict[str, Any]) -> str:
    lines = [f"{title}:"]
    for key, value in policy.items():
        lines.extend(format_policy_value(key, value))
    return "\n".join(lines)


def format_policy_value(key: str, value: Any, indent: int = 0) -> list[str]:
    prefix = "  " * indent
    if isinstance(value, dict):
        lines = [f"{prefix}- {key}:"]
        for child_key, child_value in value.items():
            lines.extend(format_policy_value(child_key, child_value, indent + 1))
        return lines
    if isinstance(value, list):
        lines = [f"{prefix}- {key}:"]
        for item in value:
            if isinstance(item, dict):
                lines.append(f"{prefix}  -")
                for child_key, child_value in item.items():
                    lines.extend(format_policy_value(child_key, child_value, indent + 2))
            else:
                lines.append(f"{prefix}  - {item}")
        return lines
    return [f"{prefix}- {key}: {value}"]
```

### Configure instructions and policies

The system prompt states the evidence rules, the tool policy defines what the agent may read and write, and the eval metadata records which version of the harness is currently promoted.


```python
SYSTEM_PROMPT = """
You are a diligence analyst reviewing a synthetic company dataroom.

Evidence scope:
- Use only files under `data/`.
- Do not use outside knowledge or assumptions.
- Prefer structured CSV/JSON exports over narrative files when they conflict.

Runtime tools:
- The sandbox starts in the mounted workspace root. Use workspace-relative paths such as `data/...` and `outputs/...`; when running shell commands, omit `workdir` or use a relative path only. Never pass absolute temporary paths.
- `data/tools/check_evidence_coverage.py`: use this before finalizing answers with material claims. Create a JSON list of claims with `claim`, `claim_type`, and `citations`, then run `python data/tools/check_evidence_coverage.py --claims-json <path> --dataset-root data --output outputs/evidence_coverage.json`.
- `data/tools/validate_output_contract.py`: run this after writing the required artifacts and before final response with `python data/tools/validate_output_contract.py --outputs outputs --dataset-root data --output outputs/output_contract_validation.json`.
- If either tool reports unsupported claims, missing citations, missing files, malformed JSON, or empty artifacts, revise the answer/artifacts before finalizing. If the evidence is unavailable, say the claim is unknown or unsupported.

Citation rules:
- Every material claim must cite one or more source filenames.
- Cite filenames exactly as workspace-relative paths, for example `financials/arr_bridge.csv`.
- Do not cite files that do not support the claim.

Unknown-handling rules:
- If evidence is missing, state that the answer is unknown or unsupported.
- Never fabricate missing numbers.
- If evidence conflicts, state the conflict explicitly instead of reconciling silently.

Output rules:
- Write `outputs/summary_answer.md`.
- Write `outputs/investment_memo.md`.
- Write `outputs/risk_register.json`.
- Write `outputs/open_questions.md`.
- Write `outputs/citations.json`.
- Write `outputs/evidence_table.csv`.

)
runtime_tools_md = "\n".join(

```

### Agent config summary

- **Version:** `v001`
- **Agent model:** `gpt-5.5`
- **Reasoning effort:** `medium`

**Required artifacts**
- `summary_answer.md`
- `investment_memo.md`
- `risk_register.json`
- `open_questions.md`
- `citations.json`
- `evidence_table.csv`

**Runtime tools**
- `data/tools/check_evidence_coverage.py` — Audit drafted material claims against cited dataroom files before final answer.
- `data/tools/validate_output_contract.py` — Validate required output artifacts, JSON shape, and citation/source file references.

### Add validation tools

The next helpers create two local tools inside the workspace: one checks whether drafted claims cite real dataroom files, and the other verifies that the required output artifacts exist and have the expected shape. The code is hidden by default to save space, but you can expand it if you want to inspect the implementation.

### Export traces for later optimization

The local exporter converts Agents SDK events into the OpenTelemetry-style JSONL that HALO can read later. It is implementation-heavy, so the code stays collapsed by default.

Set up the exporter object that receives Agents SDK spans and writes one JSONL line per span.

## Step 3. Generate traced runs

The questions are intentionally varied so the eval suite covers several ways the agent can go wrong. The notebook runs five traces by default to keep the live path practical while still covering several distinct behaviors. A larger question bank remains available if you want broader coverage later.

Each run uses the async Agents SDK path and writes a real trace plus the required artifacts.


```python
QUESTION_BANK = [
    "What do runway and burn tell us about near-term financing risk?",
    "How strong is revenue quality, and which ARR figure should we rely on?",
    "What is the real customer concentration risk after parent-account rollups?",
    "What legal exposure should an acquirer investigate first?",
    "How ready is the company for enterprise security review?",
    "Which contradictions appear across the board deck, finance exports, and management narratives?",
    "What unsupported metrics should we refuse to infer from the dataroom?",
    "What follow-up questions should management answer before an investment committee review?",
    "What are the top three diligence risks, ranked by severity?",
    "Which claims in the materials look directionally useful but still need stronger evidence?",
]

# Using 5 questions as the default, with more available if you want broader coverage later.

DEFAULT_TRACE_INDICES = [0, 1, 2, 4, 6]
TRACE_LIMIT = len(DEFAULT_TRACE_INDICES)
QUESTIONS = [QUESTION_BANK[index] for index in DEFAULT_TRACE_INDICES]

trace-01: What do runway and burn tell us about near-term financing risk?
Near-term financing risk is elevated. Finance reports `$2.9M` monthly cash burn and `11 months` runway, and the board packet corroborates both figures....

trace-02: How strong is revenue quality, and which ARR figure should we rely on?
**Answer** - Revenue quality is **moderate, not clean**: real scale and 69% gross margin, but ARR definition drift, unvalidated retention, concentration, and renewal risk weaken...

trace-03: What is the real customer concentration risk after parent-account rollups?
**Answer** - Real concentration risk is **high**: Northstar Bank + Northstar Capital Markets roll up to **Northstar Holdings at $12.4M**, or **33.6% of controlled FY2025 ARR**....

trace-04: How ready is the company for enterprise security review?
**Answer** - The company is **partially ready, but not ready for frictionless enterprise security review**: SOC 2 Type I is complete, but SOC 2 Type II fieldwork is still in...

### Inspect the agent artifacts

Each traced run writes the full artifact set required by the harness. The first run below shows the files the agent produced so you can inspect the answer, evidence, and open questions together.


````python
def show_trace_artifacts(trace: TraceRecord) -> None:
    output_dir = PROJECT_ROOT / trace.output_dir
    for artifact in agent_config.required_artifacts:
        path = output_dir / artifact
        language = {
            ".md": "markdown",
            ".json": "json",
            ".csv": "csv",
        }.get(path.suffix, "text")

# Summary Answer

Runway and burn indicate elevated near-term financing risk. Finance reports FY2025 cash burn of $2.9M per month and 11 months of runway, and the December board packet repeats the same burn and runway figures. (`financials/p_and_l.csv`, `board_deck.md`)

An 11-month runway is a sub-12-month financing window: unless burn is reduced, revenue conversion accelerates, or additional capital is secured, the company likely needs a financing plan in the near term. (`financials/p_and_l.csv`)

The financing story is somewhat weakened by ARR quality and source conflicts. The controlled FY2025 ARR bridge shows $36.9M ending ARR, while the board deck reports $43.0M because it includes $2.8M of launch-stage commitments and $1.1M of usage true-ups that finance does not classify as recurring ARR. (`financials/arr_bridge.csv`, `financials/revenue_recognition_notes.md`, `board_deck.md`)

The dataroom does not provide a cash balance, debt schedule, undrawn facility, covenant package, or financing plan, so the exact liquidity cushion and financing path are unknown from the provided evidence. (`financials/p_and_l.csv`, `manifest.json`)

# Investment Memo: Runway and Burn

## Bottom Line
- Near-term financing risk is elevated because finance reports $2.9M of monthly cash burn and only 11 months of runway. (`financials/p_and_l.csv`)
- The board packet corroborates the same $2.9M monthly burn and 11-month runway. (`board_deck.md`)
- The exact liquidity cushion is unknown because the dataroom provides runway and burn but not cash balance, debt availability, covenant terms, or a financing plan. (`financials/p_and_l.csv`, `manifest.json`)

## Evidence
- FY2025 P&L reports $30.26M revenue, 69% gross margin, $47.71M opex, $2.9M cash burn per month, and 11 months of runway. (`financials/p_and_l.csv`)
- Finance-controlled ARR is $36.9M at FY2025 year-end. (`financials/arr_bridge.csv`)
- The board deck reports $43.0M FY2025 ending ARR, 71% ARR growth, 69% gross margin, $2.9M monthly burn, and 11 months of runway. (`board_deck.md`)
- Finance states the board ARR includes $2.8M signed launch-stage commitments not live by 2025-12-31 and $1.1M usage true-ups that finance does not classify as recurring ARR. (`financials/revenue_recognition_notes.md`)

## Interpretation
- A company burning $2.9M per month with 11 months of runway has less than one year to reduce burn, convert growth into cash-efficient revenue, or raise capital. (`financials/p_and_l.csv`)
- The growth narrative should be underwritten against finance-controlled ARR rather than board headline ARR because finance identifies specific non-recurring or not-yet-live components in the board figure. (`financials/arr_bridge.csv`, `financials/revenue_recognition_notes.md`, `board_deck.md`)
- Current evidence supports a financing-risk concern, but it does not support quantifying exact cash balance, facility availability, covenant headroom, or planned raise timing. (`financials/p_and_l.csv`, `manifest.json`)

## Diligence View
- Financing risk: High / elevated.
- Key dependency: management must show a credible plan to extend runway beyond the reported 11 months.
- Critical missing evidence: cash balance, monthly cash forecast, debt/facility details, covenant headroom, and financing plan.

## Step 4. Generate example human feedback and model insights

This section simulates a human expert reviewing the traces after the agent runs. In a real diligence workflow, that might be the finance lead or another case expert who knows which details matter for the decision. In this example, the reviewer calls out that a parent-account rollup matters more than legal-entity concentration, that an unvalidated management NRR estimate should not become an official metric, and that “SOC 2 complete” is too vague when the evidence only supports Type I.

The model-generated insights stay separate. In a fully automated path, an LLM reviews the same traces and proposes recurring issues or missing behaviors. That extra pass improves coverage, while subject-matter expert review adds domain judgment grounded in the work itself.

## Step 5. Generate Promptfoo evals from traces and feedback

The eval suite is generated dynamically by an LLM from the evidence collected so far: traced behavior, human feedback, and model-generated observations. This turns comments into tests that the next harness revision can run again later.

Promptfoo is an open-source CLI and library for evaluating and red-teaming LLM applications. In this notebook, the generated behaviors become Promptfoo test cases: each one can combine literal assertions with an LLM rubric judge, so the same gate can check both exact requirements and semantic reviewer intent.

Evals are a good place to invest manual effort from subject-matter experts and developers. A fully automated pass can propose useful evals quickly, but people should still check whether the evals are accurate, representative, and measuring the behavior that actually matters before they become part of the long-term test suite.


```python
def generate_feedback_derived_evals(
    traces: list[TraceRecord],
    human_feedback: list[dict[str, Any]],
    llm_feedback: list[dict[str, Any]],
) -> list[dict[str, Any]]:
    min_eval_count = min(5, max(2, len(traces)))
    max_eval_count = min(7, max(min_eval_count, len(traces) + 2))
    response = client.responses.create(
        model=EVAL_GENERATION_MODEL,
        input=f"""
You are designing an eval suite for an OpenAI Agents SDK-backed financial diligence analyst.
Use the traces, human feedback, and LLM insights below to generate {min_eval_count} to {max_eval_count} durable eval definitions.
Return JSON only: a list of objects with keys `eval_id`, `title`, `scoring_method`, `expected_behavior`, `source_trace_id`, `rubric`, `deterministic_assertions`, `suggested_pass_example`, and `suggested_fail_example`.
`scoring_method` must be one of `deterministic`, `llm_judge`, or `hybrid`.
`source_trace_id` must exactly match the provided `trace_id` field for the trace whose answer should be scored. Do not use `sdk_trace_id` or `trace_label` for this field; those are only for SDK transport and human-readable references.
`rubric` must be a concise pass/fail grading rubric suitable for Promptfoo `llm-rubric`.
`deterministic_assertions` must be a list of Promptfoo-style assertion objects and may use only `contains`, `icontains`, or `not-contains` when a literal check is clearly useful; otherwise return an empty list.
Prefer reusable behaviors over one-off trace restatements.

| title | scoring_method | expected_behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Runway and burn must be translated into near-term financing risk | hybrid | The answer should explicitly state that financing risk is elevated because runway is 11 months and monthly cash burn is material/rising, tying burn to pressure to reduce spend, improve cash conversion, or raise capital before the sub-12-month runway closes. It should not imply the company has more than 12 months of runway. |
| Revenue quality assessment must prefer finance-controlled ARR and preserve ARR contradictions | hybrid | The answer should characterize revenue quality as mixed or moderate rather than clean, rely on finance-controlled FY2025 ending ARR of about $36.9M for underwriting, and explicitly reject or qualify the $43.0M board/headline ARR and $40.8M bookings-adjusted ARR as not equivalent to recurring ARR. It should preserve the contradiction instead of silently reconciling the gap. |
| Customer concentration must be assessed after parent-account rollups | hybrid | The answer should roll legal entities up to parent accounts before assessing concentration, specifically recognizing Northstar Holdings as the true parent exposure. It should use finance-controlled ARR as the denominator, cite or reference account hierarchy evidence, and avoid stopping at legal-entity concentration. |
| Enterprise security readiness must distinguish SOC 2 Type I from Type II | hybrid | The answer should state that the company is only partially ready for enterprise security review because SOC 2 Type I is complete but SOC 2 Type II is still in progress and no Type II report has been issued. It should treat sales FAQ language like 'SOC 2 complete' as weaker or potentially misleading evidence and connect missing Type II evidence to enterprise procurement or customer friction. |
| Unsupported metrics must be refused rather than inferred | hybrid | The answer should refuse to infer metrics that are missing, conflicted, partial, or management-estimated. In particular, it must mark CAC payback as unsupported/not provided and official NRR as unsupported because the 122% NRR is only an unvalidated management estimate. It should not promote partial or unofficial metrics into definitive diligence metrics. |

Runway and burn must be translated into near-term financing risk
 pass: Near-term financing risk is elevated: the company has only 11 months of runway and meaningful monthly burn, creating pressure to reduce burn, improve cash conversion, or raise capital within a sub-12-month window.
 fail: Financing risk appears manageable because the company has enough runway for the next year and should be able to continue operating without near-term funding pressure.

Revenue quality assessment must prefer finance-controlled ARR and preserve ARR contradictions
 pass: Revenue quality is moderate, not clean. For underwriting, use the finance-controlled ARR bridge at $36.9M, while treating the $43.0M board ARR and $40.8M bookings-adjusted view as non-comparable or planning figures because they include items not classified as recurring ARR.
 fail: Revenue quality is strong and the company has $43.0M of ARR; the board number can be used because it reconciles to the finance ARR bridge after normal adjustments.

Customer concentration must be assessed after parent-account rollups
 pass: Concentration risk is high after parent rollups: Northstar Bank and Northstar Capital Markets roll up to Northstar Holdings at about $12.4M, roughly one-third of finance-controlled ARR. Looking only at legal entities understates the dependency.
 fail: Customer concentration is acceptable because no single legal entity exceeds the threshold after reviewing the top-customer list.

Enterprise security readiness must distinguish SOC 2 Type I from Type II
 pass: The company is partially ready, not frictionless: SOC 2 Type I is complete, but Type II fieldwork is still in progress and no Type II report is available. Sales materials saying 'SOC 2 complete' should be treated cautiously because enterprise buyers are waiting on Type II evidence.
 fail: The company is ready for enterprise security review because SOC 2 is complete and the sales FAQ confirms there should be no security blocker.

Unsupported metrics must be refused rather than inferred
 pass: Refuse to infer CAC payback because it is not provided. Also refuse to treat 122% NRR as official; it is an unvalidated management estimate and should not be used as a definitive retention metric.
 fail: The company has 122% official NRR and CAC payback appears attractive based on its revenue growth, so both can be used in underwriting.
```

## Step 6. Validate the current harness with Promptfoo

Promptfoo runs the generated tests against the current trace outputs. That gives the loop a snapshot of where the harness already behaves well and which expectations still fail. Promptfoo fits this role because it can combine deterministic checks for literal requirements with `llm-rubric` judges for semantic quality.

In this notebook, the Promptfoo gate scores existing trace outputs. To validate a future harness revision, replace the trace-output provider with a provider that runs the candidate agent. Those Promptfoo results become part of the optimization input passed into HALO below. Even when eval generation is automated, humans can still tighten weak evals before letting them steer repeated optimization.


### Build the Promptfoo test harness

The provider serves existing trace outputs back to Promptfoo, and the test builder turns generated eval definitions into runnable Promptfoo cases.

## Step 7. Run HALO and write the handoff

HALO, short for Hierarchical Agent Loop Optimization, is a methodology and Python package for improving agent harnesses from execution traces. The [HALO repository](https://github.com/context-labs/halo) describes a loop that collects traces, analyzes recurring harness-level failures, hands the resulting report to a coding agent, and repeats after the harness changes.

This is the point where the loop turns the accumulated evidence into proposed harness changes. HALO reviews the current harness together with the agent traces, human feedback, model feedback, generated evals, and Promptfoo results. It then produces a ranked set of changes for the next implementation pass.

The value of HALO here is that it reasons over the whole loop at once. It can use human judgment alongside runtime behavior and eval outcomes, then package the result as a handoff Codex can use to implement the code changes that improve the harness.


### Collect the HALO inputs

Build one context object that keeps the current harness, traces, feedback, evals, and gate results together.


```python
from datetime import datetime, timezone


def serialize_agent_config(config: AgentConfig) -> dict[str, Any]:
    return {
        "version": config.version,
        "system_prompt": config.system_prompt,
        "model_settings": asdict(config.model_settings),
        "tool_policy": config.tool_policy,
        "eval_metadata": config.eval_metadata,
    }


def build_halo_context(
    traces: list[TraceRecord],
    human_feedback: list[dict[str, Any]],
    llm_feedback: list[dict[str, Any]],
    eval_suite: list[dict[str, Any]],
    gate_result: dict[str, Any],
    agent_config: AgentConfig,
) -> dict[str, Any]:
    return {
        "traces": [asdict(trace) for trace in traces],
        "human_feedback": human_feedback,
        "llm_feedback": llm_feedback,
        "eval_suite": eval_suite,
        "gate_result": gate_result,
        "agent_config": serialize_agent_config(agent_config),
    }


def synthetic_trace_id(value: str) -> str:
    return hashlib.sha256(f"halo-context-{value}".encode("utf-8")).hexdigest()[:32]


def synthetic_span_id(value: str) -> str:
    return hashlib.sha256(value.encode("utf-8")).hexdigest()[:16]


def synthetic_span(*, trace_id: str, span_id: str, name: str, observation_kind: str, attributes: dict[str, Any]) -> dict[str, Any]:
    now = datetime.now(timezone.utc).strftime("%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%f000Z")
    return {
        "trace_id": trace_id,
        "span_id": span_id,
        "parent_span_id": "",
        "trace_state": "",
        "name": name,
        "kind": "SPAN_KIND_INTERNAL",
        "start_time": now,
        "end_time": now,
        "status": {"code": "STATUS_CODE_OK", "message": ""},
        "resource": {"attributes": {"service.name": "financial-diligence-analyst"}},
        "scope": {"name": "halo-optimization-context", "version": "1"},
        "attributes": {
            "openinference.span.kind": observation_kind,
            "inference.export.schema_version": 1,
            "inference.project_id": "financial_diligence_analyst_optimization_context",
            "inference.observation_kind": observation_kind,
            **attributes,
        },
    }


def halo_input_summary(context: dict[str, Any]) -> str:
    rows = [
        ("Current harness config", 1, "global config span", "system prompt, model settings, tool policy, eval metadata"),
        ("SDK execution traces", len(context["traces"]), "original runtime traces", "agent steps, tool calls, outputs"),
        ("Human feedback", len(context["human_feedback"]), "appended to the source trace", "reviewer summary, required observations, prohibited claims"),
        ("LLM feedback", len(context["llm_feedback"]), "appended to the source trace", "model-generated observations"),
        ("Generated eval definitions", len(context["eval_suite"]), "appended to the source trace", "expected behavior, rubric, pass/fail examples"),
        ("Promptfoo row results", len(context["gate_result"]["rows"]), "appended to the source trace", "pass/fail outcome and explanation"),
        ("Promptfoo gate summary", 1, "global summary span", "suite totals across all evals"),
    ]
    lines = [
        "### HALO input summary",
        "",
        "| Input signal | Count | Where it lives | What is included |",
        "| --- | ---: | --- | --- |",
    ]
    lines.extend(f"| {name} | {count} | {location} | {included} |" for name, count, location, included in rows)
    return "\n".join(lines)
```

### Attach feedback, generated evals, and eval results to the traces

Write the combined trace file that HALO will inspect. Human feedback, LLM feedback, generated eval definitions, and row-level Promptfoo results are attached to the matching runtime trace. The overall gate summary stays global because it describes the suite as a whole.

### Define the HALO output prompt

This prompt tells HALO what kind of report to produce, including the sections Codex should receive in the final handoff file. You can customize it to match your company's workflow, review process, or use case.


```python
def render_halo_prompt() -> str:
    return """
Analyze the financial diligence analyst optimization context as the central source of truth.
The JSONL contains the current harness configuration, agent execution traces, human feedback, LLM insights, generated eval definitions, and eval-gate results.
Treat human feedback as first-class evidence.
Before recommending a change, compare the evidence against the current harness config and distinguish:
- a requirement that is missing from the harness,
- a requirement already present but not reliably followed in execution, and
- an implementation or observability defect.

Write an implementation-first Codex handoff in this exact top-level order:
1. `## Executive summary`
2. `## Top 3 changes to implement first`
3. `## Ranked recommendation table`
4. `## Supporting diagnosis and evidence`
5. `## Detailed recommendations`
6. `## Insights by feedback source`
7. `## Machine-readable summary`

Section requirements:
- `## Executive summary`: briefly state what the current harness already does well, what the highest-value remaining gaps are, and whether the current eval gate passed.
- `## Top 3 changes to implement first`: list the three most valuable implementation moves with concise rationale.
- `## Ranked recommendation table`: include rank, recommendation, impact, confidence, implementation effort, evidence, and validation.
- `## Supporting diagnosis and evidence`: include recurring harness-level failure modes, classify each against the current harness as missing requirement vs already-present-but-not-reliably-followed vs implementation/observability defect, and state the evidence source for each.
- `## Detailed recommendations`: use these exact subsection headings in this order and do not use the word "owner" in them:
  - `### Behavior contract`
    - `#### Prompt`
    - `#### Skills`
  - `### Runtime implementation`
    - `#### Tools`
    - `#### Control flow`
    - `#### Routing`
  - `### Output contract`
    - `#### Artifact schema`
  - `### Observability and evals`
    - `#### Observability`
    - `#### Evals`
- `## Insights by feedback source`: summarize what came from traces, human feedback, LLM feedback, generated evals, eval-gate results, and harness config.
- `## Machine-readable summary`: include one fenced JSON block with `top_priorities`.

Do not add extra top-level sections outside that order.
""".strip()
```

### Run HALO and format the report

HALO receives the five SDK execution traces plus two synthetic global traces: one records the current harness config, and one records the Promptfoo gate summary. That is why its trace count is higher than the five agent runs created earlier.

Generate the full optimization report, save the handoff artifact, and display the highest-priority recommendations in the notebook.

| LLM feedback | 5 | appended to the source trace | model-generated observations |
| Generated eval definitions | 5 | appended to the source trace | expected behavior, rubric, pass/fail examples |
| Promptfoo row results | 5 | appended to the source trace | pass/fail outcome and explanation |
| Promptfoo gate summary | 1 | global summary span | suite totals across all evals |

## Step 8. Hand the full report to Codex

HALO diagnoses and prioritizes. A coding agent or human still changes the harness.

Below is a snapshot of the full report Codex can act on: the top three recommendations plus a compact summary of what came from each feedback source. The complete `codex_handoff.md` file also includes the ranked changes, supporting evidence, and validation guidance for implementation.


```python
handoff_file = ARTIFACT_DIR / "codex_handoff.md"

if handoff_file.exists():
    print(f"Full Codex handoff written to: {handoff_file.relative_to(PROJECT_ROOT)}")
    print("Snapshot below; open the generated codex_handoff.md file to review the full handoff.")
    display(Markdown(render_notebook_halo_summary(handoff_file.read_text(encoding="utf-8"))))
else:
    print(f"Codex handoff not found yet: {handoff_file.relative_to(PROJECT_ROOT)}")
    print("Run the HALO optimization cell above to generate it.")
```

```text

```

## Top 3 changes to implement first

1. **Add a deterministic diligence fact ledger and domain checklist layer.**  
   Encode canonical facts and source-of-truth rules for ARR, runway/burn, parent-account concentration, unsupported metrics, and SOC 2 status so the agent cannot rely only on generic citation instructions.

2. **Upgrade validators to audit the actual output artifacts, not just claimed evidence coverage.**  
   Current validation can pass while artifact-level citation or claim-audit issues still require later repair. Parse generated markdown/JSON/CSV artifacts, extract material claims, verify source support, and fail on unsupported or unaudited claims.

3. **Persist the five generated evals into the checked-in regression suite.**  
   The generated evals all passed, but they should become durable regression tests so future prompt/runtime changes cannot regress on the specific human-feedback issues.

## Insights by feedback source

| Feedback source | Key insights |
|---|---|
| Traces | The agent generally follows the artifact-generation workflow and validation loop, but execution is generic and sometimes monolithic. Some repairs happen after validators pass, showing validation is not strict enough. Parent concentration trace demonstrated a good deterministic-calculation pattern worth generalizing. |
| Human feedback | Human feedback is the strongest evidence for domain gaps: runway must be 11 months with financing pressure; ARR must use finance-controlled source of truth; concentration must roll up to parent accounts; SOC 2 Type I and Type II must not be conflated; official NRR and CAC payback must be refused when unsupported. |
| LLM feedback | LLM insights reinforce the human themes: ARR headline numbers need caveats, unsupported metrics should not be promoted, retention and pipeline claims require source caveats, and SOC 2 Type II completion must not be overstated. |
| Generated evals | Five targeted evals were generated from the feedback themes: runway/burn, ARR source of truth, customer concentration parent rollup, SOC 2 precision, and unsupported metrics refusal. These encode the right regression surface and should be checked in. |
| Eval-gate results | The current eval gate passed: 5 total, 5 passed, 0 failed. This indicates the latest generated eval suite is satisfied, but the suite should be persisted and expanded to cover validators, artifact parsing, and calculation correctness. |
| Harness config | The harness already has strong generic evidence, citation, artifact, and validation requirements. Its main weakness is that it lacks explicit financial-diligence invariants and deterministic runtime checks for the exact mistakes surfaced by feedback. |

## Step 9. Close the loop

Now that the full workflow is in place, we can revisit the optimization flywheel from the top of the notebook. The same architecture supports two operating modes.

![Agent improvement loop flywheel](https://developers.openai.com/cookbook/assets/images/agent-improvement-loop-flywheel.svg)

![Human review gates in the loop](https://developers.openai.com/cookbook/assets/images/agent-improvement-loop-human-gates.svg)

It can run as a closed loop, where new traces, human and model feedback, generated Promptfoo evals, HALO diagnosis, Codex implementation, validation, and deployment all feed the next cycle. In that mode, the handoff artifact can be written to shared storage, and a Codex automation with a heartbeat can keep checking for new handoffs, wake up when one appears, and trigger the next implementation pass automatically.

The developer can also add human gates wherever they want them, including trace review, eval refinement, pull request approval, merge, and deployment.

The design choice is how much humans participate after they give feedback. Human judgment can steer a loop where agents do the execution, or humans can remain approval gates throughout the process. In both versions, human feedback stays central because it shapes what the system learns and what it changes next.


## Conclusion

An agent improvement loop offers a path toward continual improvement without reducing the problem to prompt tuning alone. The full loop matters: traces capture behavior, human feedback adds judgment, evals preserve what the system should do, HALO turns the evidence into ranked harness changes, and Codex can implement the next pass.

This area is still evolving, and some of the individual components will likely change over time. The larger idea of loop engineering is the durable part: agents can improve from real behavior when feedback, testing, and implementation are connected in one loop.


## Next steps

- Choose the model for each stage of the loop by editing `AGENT_MODEL`, `ANALYSIS_MODEL`, `EVAL_GENERATION_MODEL`, `JUDGE_MODEL`, and `HALO_MODEL` near the top of the notebook.
- Create your own traces to test the agent.
- Decide how much of the final path should remain reviewed versus automated: you can stop at a developer-reviewed PR, or wire the handoff into a system that opens, merges, and deploys changes automatically.
- Pass the generated `codex_handoff.md` file under `ARTIFACT_DIR` to Codex, inspect the harness changes it proposes, and rerun the same eval suite against the updated harness.
