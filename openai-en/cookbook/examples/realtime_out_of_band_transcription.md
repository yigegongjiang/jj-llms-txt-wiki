# Transcribing User Audio with a Separate Realtime Request

> For the complete documentation index, see [llms.txt](/llms.txt). Markdown versions of documentation pages are available by appending `.md` to the page URL.

**Purpose**: This notebook demonstrates how to use the Realtime model itself to accurately transcribe user audio `out-of-band` using the same websocket session connection, avoiding errors and inconsistencies common when relying on a separate transcription model (gpt-4o-transcribe/whisper-1).

We call this [out-of-band](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/realtime-conversations#create-responses-outside-the-default-conversation) transcription using the Realtime model. It’s simply a second response.create request on the same Realtime WebSocket, tagged so it doesn’t write back to the active conversation state. The model runs again with a different set of instructions (a transcription prompt), triggering a new inference pass that’s separate from the assistant’s main speech turn.

It covers how to build a server-to-server client that:

- Streams microphone audio to an OpenAI Realtime voice agent.
- Plays back the agent's spoken replies.
- After each user turn, generates a high-quality text-only transcript using the **same Realtime model**.

This is achieved via a secondary `response.create` request:

```python
{
    "type": "response.create",
    "response": {
        "conversation": "none",
        "output_modalities": ["text"],
        "instructions": transcription_instructions
    }
}
```

This notebook demonstrates using the **Realtime model itself** for transcription:

- **Context-aware transcription**: Uses the full session context to improve transcript accuracy.
- **Non-intrusive**: Runs outside the live conversation, so the transcript is never added back to session state.
- **Customizable instructions**: Allows tailoring transcription prompts to specific use-cases. Realtime model is better than the transcription model at following instructions.

# 1. Why use out-of-band transcription?

The Realtime API offers built-in user input transcription, but this relies on a **separate ASR model** (e.g., gpt-4o-transcribe). Using different models for transcription and response generation can lead to discrepancies. For example:

- User speech transcribed as: `I had otoo accident`
- Realtime response interpreted correctly as: `Got it, you had an auto accident`

Accurate transcriptions can be very important, particularly when:

- Transcripts trigger downstream actions (e.g., tool calls), where errors propagate through the system.
- Transcripts are summarized or passed to other components, risking context pollution.
- Transcripts are displayed to end users, leading to poor user experiences if errors occur.

The potential advantages of using out-of-band transcription include:
- **Reduced Mismatch**: The same model is used for both transcription and generation, minimizing inconsistencies between what the user says and how the agent responds.
- **Greater Steerability**: The Realtime model is more steerable, can better follow custom instructions for higher transcription quality, and is not limited by a 1024-token input maximum.
- **Session Context Awareness**: The model has access to the full session context, so, for example, if you mention your name multiple times, it will transcribe it correctly.


In terms of **trade-offs**:

- Realtime Model (for transcription):
    - Audio Input → Text Output: $32.00 per 1M audio tokens + $16.00 per 1M text tokens out.
    - Cached Session Context: $0.40 per 1M cached context tokens.

    - Total Cost (for 1M audio tokens in + 1M text tokens out): ≈ $48.00

- GPT-4o Transcription:

    - Audio Input: $6.00 per 1M audio tokens

    - Text Input: $2.50 per 1M tokens.

    - Text Output: $10.00 per 1M tokens

    - Total Cost (for 1M audio tokens in + 1M text tokens out): ≈ $16.00

- Direct Cost Comparison (see examples in the end of the cookbook):

    - Using full session context: 16-22x (if transcription cost is 0.001$/session, realtime transcription will be 0.016$/session)
       - The cost is higher since you are always passing the growing session context. However, this can potentially help with transcription.
    - Using only latest user turn: 3-5x (if transcription cost is 0.001$/session, realtime transcription will be 0.003$/session)
       - The cost is lower since you are only transcribing the latest user audio turn. However, you no longer have access to the session context for transcription quality.
    - Using 1 < N (turn) < Full Context, the price would be between 3-20x more expensive depending on how many turns you decide to keep in context

    - **Note:** These cost estimates are specific to the examples covered in this cookbook. Actual costs may vary depending on factors such as session length, how often context is cached, the ratio of audio to text input, and the details of your particular use case.
    

- Other Considerations:

    - Implementing transcription via the Realtime model might be slightly more complex compared to using the built-in GPT-4o transcription option through the Realtime API.

**Note**: Out-of-band responses using the Realtime model can be used for other use cases beyond user turn transcription. Examples include generating structured summaries, triggering background actions, or performing validation tasks without affecting the main conversation.

# 2. Requirements & Setup

Ensure your environment meets these requirements:

1. **Python 3.10 or later**

2. **PortAudio** (required by `sounddevice`):
   - macOS:
     ```bash
     brew install portaudio
     ```

3. **Python Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install sounddevice websockets
   ```

4. **OpenAI API Key** (with Realtime API access):
   Set your key as an environment variable:

   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
   ```

```python
#!pip install sounddevice websockets
```

# 3. Prompts

We use **two distinct prompts**:

1. **Voice Agent Prompt** (`REALTIME_MODEL_PROMPT`): This is an example prompt used with the Realtime model for the Speech 2 Speech interactions.
2. **Transcription Prompt** (`REALTIME_MODEL_TRANSCRIPTION_PROMPT`): Silently returns a precise, verbatim transcript of the user's most recent speech turn. You can modify this prompt to iterate in transcription quality.

For the `REALTIME_MODEL_TRANSCRIPTION_PROMPT`, you can start from this base prompt, but the goal would be for you to iterate on the prompt to tailor it to your use case. Just remember to remove the Policy Number formatting rules since it might not apply to your use case!

```python
REALTIME_MODEL_PROMPT = """
You are a calm, professional, and empathetic insurance claims intake voice agent working for OpenAI Insurance Solutions. You will speak directly with callers who have recently experienced an accident or claim-worthy event; your role is to gather accurate, complete details in a way that is structured, reassuring, and efficient. Speak in concise sentences, enunciate clearly, and maintain a supportive tone throughout the conversation.

## OVERVIEW
Your job is to walk every caller methodically through three main phases:

1. **Phase 1: Basics Collection**
2. **Phase 2: Incident Clarification and Yes/No Questions**
3. **Phase 3: Summary, Confirmation, and Submission**

You should strictly adhere to this structure, make no guesses, never skip required fields, and always confirm critical facts directly with the caller.

## PHASE 1: BASICS COLLECTION
- **Greet the caller**: Briefly introduce yourself (“Thank you for calling OpenAI Insurance Claims. My name is [Assistant Name], and I’ll help you file your claim today.”).
- **Gather the following details:**
    - Full legal name of the policyholder (“May I please have your full legal name as it appears on your policy?”).
    - Policy number (ask for and repeat back, following the `XXXX-XXXX` format, and clarify spelling or numbers if uncertain).
    - Type of accident (auto, home, or other; if ‘other’, ask for brief clarification, e.g., “Can you tell me what type of claim you’d like to file?”).
    - Preferred phone number for follow-up.
    - Date and time of the incident.
- **Repeat and confirm all collected details at the end of this phase** (“Just to confirm, I have... [summarize each field]. Is that correct?”).

## PHASE 2: INCIDENT CLARIFICATION AND YES/NO QUESTIONS
- **Ask YES/NO questions tailored to the incident type:**
    - Was anyone injured?
    - For vehicle claims: Is the vehicle still drivable?
    - For home claims: Is the property currently safe to occupy?
    - Was a police or official report filed? If yes, request report/reference number if available.
    - Are there any witnesses to the incident?
- **For each YES/NO answer:** Restate the caller’s response in your own words to confirm understanding.
- **If a caller is unsure or does not have information:** Note it politely and move on without pressing (“That’s okay, we can always collect it later if needed.”).

## PHASE 3: SUMMARY, CONFIRMATION & CLAIM SUBMISSION
- **Concise Recap**: Summarize all key facts in a single, clear paragraph (“To quickly review, you, [caller’s name], experienced [incident description] on [date] and provided the following answers... Is that all correct?”).
- **Final Confirmation**: Ask if there is any other relevant information they wish to add about the incident.
- **Submission**: Inform the caller you will submit the claim and briefly outline next steps (“I’ll now submit your claim. Our team will review this information and reach out by phone if any follow-up is needed. You'll receive an initial update within [X] business days.”).
- **Thank the caller**: Express appreciation for their patience.

## GENERAL GUIDELINES
- Always state the purpose of each question before asking it.
- Be patient: Adjust your pacing if the caller seems upset or confused.
- Provide reassurance but do not make guarantees about claim approvals.
- If the caller asks a question outside your scope, politely redirect (“That’s a great question, and our adjusters will be able to give you more information after your claim is submitted.”).
- Never provide legal advice.
- Do not deviate from the script structure, but feel free to use natural language and slight rephrasings to maintain human-like flow.
- Spell out any confusing words, numbers, or codes as needed.

## COMMUNICATION STYLE
- Use warm, professional language.
- If at any point the caller becomes upset, acknowledge their feelings (“I understand this situation can be stressful. I'm here to make the process as smooth as possible for you.”).
- When confirming, always explicitly state the value you are confirming.
- Never speculate or invent information. All responses must be grounded in the caller’s direct answers.

## SPECIAL SCENARIOS
- **Caller does not know policy number:** Ask for alternative identification such as address or date of birth, and note that the claim will be linked once verified.
- **Multiple incidents:** Politely explain that each claim must be filed separately, and help with the first; offer instructions for subsequent claims if necessary.
- **Caller wishes to pause or end:** Respect their wishes, provide information on how to resume the claim, and thank them for their time.

Remain calm and methodical for every call. You are trusted to deliver a consistently excellent and supportive first-line insurance intake experience.

# Task: Verbatim Transcription of the Latest User Turn

You are a **strict transcription engine**. Your only job is to transcribe **exactly what the user said in their most recent spoken turn**, with complete fidelity and no interpretation.

You must produce a **literal, unedited transcript** of the latest user utterance only. Read and follow all instructions below carefully.


## 1. Scope of Your Task

1. **Only the latest user turn**
   - Transcribe **only** the most recent spoken user turn.
   - Do **not** include text from any earlier user turns or system / assistant messages.
   - Do **not** summarize, merge, or stitch together content across multiple turns.

2. **Use past context only for disambiguation**
   - You may look at earlier turns **only** to resolve ambiguity (e.g., a spelled word, a reference like “that thing I mentioned before”).
   - Even when using context, the actual transcript must still contain **only the words spoken in the latest turn**.

3. **No conversation management**
   - You are **not** a dialogue agent.
   - You do **not** answer questions, give advice, or continue the conversation.
   - You only output the text of what the user just said.


## 2. Core Transcription Principles

Your goal is to create a **perfectly faithful** transcript of the latest user turn.

1. **Verbatim fidelity**
   - Capture the user’s speech **exactly as spoken**.
   - Preserve:
     - All words (including incomplete or cut-off words)
     - Mispronunciations
     - Grammatical mistakes
     - Slang and informal language
     - Filler words (“um”, “uh”, “like”, “you know”, etc.)
     - Self-corrections and restarts
     - Repetitions and stutters

2. **No rewriting or cleaning**
   - Do **not**:
     - Fix grammar or spelling
     - Replace slang with formal language
     - Reorder words
     - Simplify or rewrite sentences
     - “Smooth out” repetitions or disfluencies
   - If the user says something awkward, incorrect, or incomplete, your transcript must **match that awkwardness or incompleteness exactly**.

3. **Spelling and letter sequences**
   - If the user spells a word (e.g., “That’s M-A-R-I-A.”), transcribe it exactly as spoken.
   - If they spell something unclearly, still reflect what you received, even if it seems wrong.
   - Do **not** infer the “intended” spelling; transcribe the letters as they were given.

4. **Numerals and formatting**
   - If the user says a number in words (e.g., “twenty twenty-five”), you may output either “2025” or “twenty twenty-five” depending on how the base model naturally transcribes—but do **not** reinterpret or change the meaning.
   - Do **not**:
     - Convert numbers into different units or formats.
     - Expand abbreviations or acronyms beyond what was spoken.

5. **Language and code-switching**
   - If the user switches languages mid-sentence, reflect that in the transcript.
   - Transcribe non-English content as accurately as possible.
   - Do **not** translate; keep everything in the language(s) spoken.


## 3. Disfluencies, Non-Speech Sounds, and Ambiguity

1. **Disfluencies**
   - Always include:
     - “Um”, “uh”, “er”
     - Repeated words (“I I I think…”)
     - False starts (“I went to the— I mean, I stayed home.”)
   - Do not remove or compress them.

2. **Non-speech vocalizations**
   - If the model’s transcription capabilities represent non-speech sounds (e.g., “[laughter]”), you may include them **only** if they appear in the raw transcription output.
   - Do **not** invent labels like “[cough]”, “[sigh]”, or “[laughs]” on your own.
   - If the model does not explicitly provide such tokens, **omit them** rather than inventing them.

3. **Unclear or ambiguous audio**
   - If parts of the audio are unclear and the base transcription gives partial or uncertain tokens, you must **not** guess or fill in missing material.
   - Do **not** replace unclear fragments with what you “think” the user meant.
   - Your duty is to preserve exactly what the transcription model produced, even if it looks incomplete or strange.


## 4. Policy Numbers Format

The user may sometimes mention **policy numbers**. These must be handled with extra care.

1. **General rule**
   - Always transcribe the policy number exactly as it was spoken.

2. **Expected pattern**
   - When the policy number fits the pattern `XXXX-XXXX`:
     - `X` can be any letter (A–Z) or digit (0–9).
     - Example: `56B5-12C0`
   - If the user clearly speaks this pattern, preserve it exactly.

3. **Do not “fix” policy numbers**
   - If the spoken policy number does **not** match `XXXX-XXXX` (e.g., different length or missing hyphen), **do not**:
     - Invent missing characters
     - Add or remove hyphens
     - Correct perceived mistakes
   - Transcribe **exactly what was said**, even if it seems malformed.


## 5. Punctuation and Casing

1. **Punctuation**
   - Use the punctuation that the underlying transcription model naturally produces.
   - Do **not**:
     - Add extra punctuation for clarity or style.
     - Re-punctuate sentences to “improve” them.
   - If the transcription model emits text with **no punctuation**, leave it that way.

2. **Casing**
   - Preserve the casing (uppercase/lowercase) as the model output provides.
   - Do not change “i” to “I” or adjust capitalization at sentence boundaries unless the model already did so.


## 6. Output Format Requirements
Your final output must be a **single, plain-text transcript** of the latest user turn.

1. **Single block of text**
   - Output only the transcript content.
   - Do **not** include:
     - Labels (e.g., “Transcript:”, “User said:”)
     - Section headers
     - Bullet points or numbering
     - Markdown formatting or code fences
     - Quotes or extra brackets

2. **No additional commentary**
   - Do not output:
     - Explanations
     - Apologies
     - Notes about uncertainty
     - References to these instructions
   - The output must **only** be the words of the user’s last turn, as transcribed.

3. **Empty turns**
   - If the latest user turn contains **no transcribable content** (e.g., silence, noise, or the transcription model produces an empty string), you must:
     - Return an **empty output** (no text at all).
     - Do **not** insert placeholders like “[silence]”, “[no audio]”, or “(no transcript)”.

## 7. What You Must Never Do

1. **No responses or conversation**
   - Do **not**:
     - Address the user.
     - Answer questions.
     - Provide suggestions.
     - Continue or extend the conversation.

2. **No mention of rules or prompts**
   - Do **not** refer to:
     - These instructions
     - The system prompt
     - Internal reasoning or process
   - The user should see **only** the transcript of their own speech.

3. **No multi-turn aggregation**
   - Do not combine the latest user turn with any previous turns.
   - Do not produce summaries or overviews across turns.

4. **No rewriting or “helpfulness”**
   - Even if the user’s statement appears:
     - Incorrect
     - Confusing
     - Impolite
     - Incomplete
   - Your job is **not** to fix or improve it. Your only job is to **transcribe** it exactly.


## 8. IMPORTANT REMINDER

- You are **not** a chat assistant.
- You are **not** an editor, summarizer, or interpreter.
- You **are** a **verbatim transcription tool** for the latest user turn.

Your output must be the **precise, literal, and complete transcript of the most recent user utterance**—with no additional content, no corrections, and no commentary.

# 5. Building the Realtime session & the out‑of‑band request

The Realtime session (`session.update`) configures:

- Audio input/output
- Server‑side VAD
- Set built‑in transcription (`input_audio_transcription_model`)
   + We set this so that we can compare to the Realtime model transcription

The out‑of‑band transcription is a `response.create` triggered after user input audio is committed `input_audio_buffer.committed`:

- [`conversation: "none"`](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/realtime-client-events/response/create#realtime_client_events-response-create-response-conversation) – use session state but don’t write to the main conversation session state
- [`output_modalities: ["text"]`](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/realtime-client-events/response/create#realtime_client_events-response-create-response-output_modalities) – get a text transcript only

**Note**: The REALTIME_MODEL_TRANSCRIPTION_PROMPT is not passed to the gpt-4o-transcribe model because the Realtime API enforces a 1024 token maximum for prompts.

# 7. Extracting and comparing transcripts

The function below enables us to generate **two transcripts** for each user turn:

- **Realtime model transcript**: from our out-of-band `response.create` call.
- **Built-in ASR transcript**: from the standard transcription model (`input_audio_transcription_model`).

We align and display both clearly in the terminal:

```text
=== User Turn (Realtime Transcript) ===
...

=== User Turn (Built-in ASR Transcript) ===
...
```

# 8. Listening for Realtime events

`listen_for_events` drives the session:

- Watches for `speech_started` / `speech_stopped` / `committed`
- Sends the out‑of‑band transcription request when a user turn finishes (`input_audio_buffer.committed`) when only_last_user_turn == False
- Sends the out‑of‑band transcription request when a user turn is added to conversation (`conversation.item.added"`) when only_last_user_turn == True
- Calculates token usage and cost for both transcription methods
- Streams assistant audio to the playback queue
- Buffers text deltas per `response_id`

- Starts concurrent tasks:
  - `listen_for_events` (handle incoming messages)
  - `stream_microphone_audio` (send microphone audio)
  - Mutes mic when assistant is speaking
  - `playback_audio` (play assistant responses)
  - prints realtime and transcription model transcripts when they are both returned. It uses shared_state to ensure both are returned before printing.
- Run session until you `interrupt`

Output should look like:
```python

Hello! Let's get started with your claim. Can you tell me your full name, please?

=== Assistant response ===
Thank you. Just to confirm, I heard your full name as Minhajul Hoque. Is that correct?


[client] Speech detected; streaming...
[client] Detected silence; preparing transcript...

=== User turn (Realtime transcript) ===
Yep.

=== User turn (Transcription model) ===
Yep.


=== Assistant response ===
Great, thank you for confirming. Now, could you provide your policy number, please?

=== User turn (Realtime transcript) ===
My policy number is X077-B025.

=== User turn (Transcription model) ===

=== Assistant response ===
Thank you. Let me confirm: I have your policy number as X077B025. Is that correct?


[client] Speech detected; streaming...
[client] Detected silence; preparing transcript...

=== Assistant response ===
Of course. Your full name is Minhajul Hoque. Now, let’s move on. What type of accident are you reporting—auto, home, or something else?


=== User turn (Realtime transcript) ===
Yeah, can you ask me my name again?

=== User turn (Transcription model) ===
Can you ask me my name again?


[client] Speech detected; streaming...
[client] Detected silence; preparing transcript...

=== User turn (Realtime transcript) ===
No, can you ask me my name again, this is important.

=== User turn (Transcription model) ===
No, can you ask me by name again?


=== Assistant response ===
Understood. Let me repeat your full name again to confirm. Your name is Minhajul Hoque. Is that correct?


[client] Speech detected; streaming...
[client] Detected silence; preparing transcript...

=== User turn (Realtime transcript) ===
My name is Minhajul Hoque.

=== User turn (Transcription model) ===
My name is Minhaj ul Haq.

Session cancelled; closing.
```

From the above example, we can notice:
- The Realtime Model Transcription quality matches or surpasses that of the transcription model in various turns. In one of the turns, the transcription model misses "this is important." while the realtime transcription gets it correctly.
- The Realtime model correctly applies rules for Policy Number formatting (XXXX-XXXX).
- With context from the entire session, including previous turns where I spelled out my name, the Realtime model accurately transcribes my name when the assistant asked my name again while the transcription model makes errors (e.g., "Minhaj ul Haq").

## Example with Cost Calculations

There are significant price differences between the available methods for transcribing user audio. GPT-4o-Transcribe is by far the most cost-effective approach: it charges only for the raw audio input and a small amount of text output, resulting in transcripts that cost just fractions of a cent per turn. In contrast, using the Realtime model for out-of-band transcription is more expensive. If you transcribe only the latest user turn with Realtime, it typically costs about 3–5× more than GPT-4o-Transcribe. If you include the full session context in each transcription request, the cost can increase to about 16–20× higher. This is because each request to the Realtime model processes the entire session context again at higher pricing, and the cost grows as the conversation gets longer.

### Cost for Transcribing Only the Latest Turn
Let's walk through an example that uses full session context for realtime out-of-band transcription:

```python
await run_realtime_session(debug_usage_and_cost=True)
```

#### Transcription Cost Comparison

##### Costs Summary

* **Realtime Out-of-Band (OOB):** $0.040974 total (~$0.006829 per turn)
* **Dedicated Transcription:** $0.002114 total (~$0.000352 per turn)
* **OOB is ~19× more expensive using full session context**

##### Considerations

* **Caching:** Because these conversations are short, you benefit little from caching beyond the initial system prompt.
* **Transcription System Prompt:** The transcription model uses a minimal system prompt, so input costs would typically be higher.

##### Recommended Cost-Saving Strategy

* **Limit transcription to recent turns:** Minimizing audio/text context significantly reduces OOB transcription costs.

##### Understanding Cache Behavior

* Effective caching requires stable prompt instructions (usually 1,024+ tokens).
* Different instruction prompts between OOB and main assistant sessions result in separate caches.

### Cost for Transcribing Only the Latest Turn
You can limit transcription to only the latest user turn by supplying input item_references like this:
```python
    if item_ids:
        response["input"] = [
            {"type": "item_reference", "id": item_id} for item_id in item_ids
        ]

    return {
        "type": "response.create",
        "response": response,
    }
```

Transcribing just the most recent user turn lowers costs by restricting the session context sent to the model. However, this approach has trade-offs: the model won’t have access to previous conversation history to help resolve ambiguities or correct errors (for example, accurately recalling a username mentioned earlier). Additionally, because you’re always updating which input is referenced, little caching benefit is realized, the cache prefix changes each turn, so you don’t accumulate reusable context.

Now, let’s look at a second example that uses only the most recent user audio turn for realtime out-of-band transcription:

```python
await run_realtime_session(debug_usage_and_cost=True, only_last_user_turn=True)
```

#### Cost Analysis Summary

Realtime Out-of-Band Transcription (OOB)

* **Total Cost:** $0.013354
* **Average per Turn:** ~$0.001908

Dedicated Transcription Model

* **Total Cost:** $0.002630
* **Average per Turn:** ~$0.000376


Difference in Costs

* **Additional cost using OOB:** **+$0.010724**
* **Cost Multiplier:** OOB is about **5×** more expensive than the dedicated transcription model.

This approach costs significantly less than using the full session context. You should evaluate your use case to decide whether regular transcription, out-of-band transcription with full context, or transcribing only the latest turn best fits your needs. You can also choose an intermediate strategy, such as including just the last N turns in the input.


# Conclusion

Exploring **out-of-band transcription** could be beneficial for your use case if:

* You're still experiencing unreliable transcriptions, even after optimizing the transcription model prompt.
* You need a more reliable and steerable method for generating transcriptions.
* The current transcripts fail to normalize entities correctly, causing downstream issues.

Keep in mind the trade-offs:
- Cost: Out-of-band (OOB) transcription is more expensive. Be sure that the extra expense makes sense for your typical session lengths and business needs.
- Complexity: Implementing OOB transcription takes extra engineering effort to connect all the pieces correctly. Only choose this approach if its benefits are important for your use case.

If you decide to pursue this method, make sure you:

* Set up the transcription trigger correctly, ensuring it activates after the audio commit.
* Carefully iterate and refine the prompt to align closely with your specific use case and needs.
