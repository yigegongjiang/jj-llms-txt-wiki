# **Exploring Model Graders for Reinforcement Fine-Tuning**

> For the complete documentation index, see [llms.txt](/llms.txt). Markdown versions of documentation pages are available by appending `.md` to the page URL.

*This guide is for developers and ML practitioners who already know their way around OpenAIʼs APIs, have a basic understanding of reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), and wish to use their fine-tuned models for research or other appropriate uses. OpenAI’s services are not intended for the personalized treatment or diagnosis of any medical condition and are subject to our [applicable terms](https://openai.com/policies/).*

[Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT)](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/reinforcement-fine-tuning) of reasoning models consists of running reinforcement learning on top of the models to improve their reasoning performance by exploring the solution space and reinforcing strategies that result in a higher reward. RFT helps the model make sharper decisions and interpret context more effectively. 


In this guide, weʼll walk through how to apply RFT to the OpenAI `o4-mini` reasoning model, using a task from the life sciences research domain: predicting outcomes from doctor-patient transcripts and descriptions, which is a necessary assessment in many health research studies. We'll use a subset of the medical-o1-verifiable-problem [dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/FreedomIntelligence/medical-o1-verifiable-problem/viewer/default/train?row=0). You will learn key steps to take in order to successfully run RFT jobs for your use cases.

Here’s what we’ll cover:

- **[2. Gathering the dataset](#2-gathering-the-dataset)**
- **[3. Benchmarking the base model](#3-benchmarking-the-base-model)**
- **[4. Defining your grader](#4-defining-your-grader)**
- **[5. Training](#5-training)**
- **[6. Using your fine-tuned model](#6-using-your-fine-tuned-model)**

## **1. Setup**

Even strong reasoning models can miss the mark when it comes to expert-level behavior-especially in domains like medicine, where nuance and exactness matter. Imagine a model trying to extract [ICD-10](https://www.cms.gov/medicare/coding-billing/icd-10-codes) codes from a transcript: even if it understands the gist, it may not use the precise terminology expected by medical professionals. 

Other great candidates for RFT include topics like ledger normalization or tiering fraud risk- settings in which you want precise, reliable, and repeatable reasoning. Checkout our [RFT use-cases guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/rft-use-cases) for great examples. 

In our case, weʼll focus on teaching `o4-mini` to become better at predicting the outcomes of clinical conversations and descriptions. Specifically, we want to see if RFT can boost the accuracy of the prediction. 

Along the way, weʼll talk about how to write effective graders, how they guide the modelʼs learning, and how to watch out for classic reward-hacking pitfalls.

## **2. Gathering the Dataset**

Letʼs start off by loading the dataset from Hugging Face. Weʼre interested in samples framed as a description of a patient case with an associated question, followed by the correct answer. These represent real world transcripts where a physician is summarizing a case and assigning an outcome. For any use-case, verifying the accuracy of the gold level answers is critical and requires careful consideration. Here, we will trust the dataset quality.

```python
import re
from datasets import load_dataset
ds = load_dataset("FreedomIntelligence/medical-o1-verifiable-problem")

def is_age_question(sample):
    question = sample.get('Open-ended Verifiable Question', '')
    # Match "A 88-year-old", "An 8-year-old", "A 23-year-old", etc. at the start
    return re.match(r"^(A|An) \d{1,2}-year-old", question) is not None

filtered_samples = [s for s in ds["train"] if is_age_question(s)]
print(f"Filtered samples: {len(filtered_samples)}")
```

  from .autonotebook import tqdm as notebook_tqdm
```

```text
Filtered samples: 9169
```

One of the advantages of RFT is that it doesnʼt need thousands of samples to start making a difference. Thanks to trajectory sampling and the feedback loop during training, the model learns not just correct behaviors, but also patterns to avoid. This means we can see solid gains even with small datasets.

For this run, weʼll randomly sample 100 training and 100 test examples and slightly normalize them.

```python
import random

# Set a random seed for reproducibility
random.seed(42)

# Randomly select 100 training samples from filtered_samples
train_samples = random.sample(filtered_samples, min(100, len(filtered_samples)))

# Remove training samples from filtered_samples to avoid overlap
remaining_samples = [s for s in filtered_samples if s not in train_samples]

# Randomly select 100 test samples from the remaining samples (no overlap)
test_samples = random.sample(remaining_samples, min(100, len(remaining_samples)))

print(f"Number of training samples: {len(train_samples)}")
print(f"Number of test samples: {len(test_samples)}")
```

```text
Number of training samples: 100
Number of test samples: 100
```

```python
# Standardize the 'Ground-True Answer' fields to all lowercase in train and test samples
for sample in train_samples:
    if 'Ground-True Answer' in sample and isinstance(sample['Ground-True Answer'], str):
        sample['Ground-True Answer'] = sample['Ground-True Answer'].lower()

for sample in test_samples:
    if 'Ground-True Answer' in sample and isinstance(sample['Ground-True Answer'], str):
        sample['Ground-True Answer'] = sample['Ground-True Answer'].lower()
```

We'll convert these samples to `jsonl` format, as expected by the [reinforcement finetuning API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/fine-tuning/reinforcement-input).

```python
import json

def convert_to_jsonl_format(samples, filename):
    with open(filename, "w") as f:
        for sample in samples:
            user_content = sample.get("Open-ended Verifiable Question", "")
            reference_answer = sample.get("Ground-True Answer", "")
            json_obj = {
                "messages": [
                    {"role": "user", "content": user_content}
                ],
                "reference_answer": reference_answer
            }
            f.write(json.dumps(json_obj) + "\n")

def load_jsonl(filename):
    samples = []
    with open(filename, "r") as f:
        for line in f:
            samples.append(json.loads(line))
    return samples

# Save the datasets to jsonl files
convert_to_jsonl_format(train_samples, "data/medical_01_verifiable_problem_train.jsonl")
convert_to_jsonl_format(test_samples, "data/medical_01_verifiable_problem_val.jsonl")

# Load the datasets back from jsonl files
train_samples_loaded = load_jsonl("data/medical_01_verifiable_problem_train.jsonl")
test_samples_loaded = load_jsonl("data/medical_01_verifiable_problem_val.jsonl")
```


Next up: we’ll see how the base model performs out of the box-and where there’s room to grow.

## **3. Benchmarking the Base Model**

Before we fine-tune anything, we need to know where we’re starting from. Benchmarking gives us a clear picture of the model’s initial strengths and weaknesses-so we can later measure how far it’s come.

We’ll first lean on two simple yet powerful evaluators:

1. `clinical_phrase_binary_grader` - an exact-match checker.
2. `clinical_phrase_grader` - a softer, token-based similarity grader.

```python
from rapidfuzz import fuzz, utils

def clinical_phrase_grader(sample: dict, item: dict) -> float:
    from rapidfuzz import fuzz, utils
    score = fuzz.token_set_ratio(sample["output_text"], item["reference_answer"], processor=utils.default_process)
    return score / 100.0

def clinical_phrase_binary_grader(sample: dict, item: dict) -> float:
    return 1.0 if sample["output_text"] == item["reference_answer"] else 0.0

def combined_grader(sample: dict, item: dict, weights: list[float] = [0.85, 0.15]) -> float:
    clinical_phrase_score = clinical_phrase_grader(sample, item)
    binary_score = clinical_phrase_binary_grader(sample, item)
    return weights[0] * clinical_phrase_score + weights[1] * binary_score
```

This combination lets us track both strict correctness and partial lexical overlap. The binary grader gives a crisp 0 or 1: did the model produce an exact match? The softer one gives more nuance—how close did the output come to the gold answer? We use both because outcomes are often phrased in multiple valid ways. For instance, a model might respond with “gouty arthritis” instead of “gout.” While a human evaluator could consider this partially acceptable, a strict string match would not. Combining exact and fuzzy scoring ensures a more accurate and fair assessment of model outputs. 

We build a helper function to prepend the examples with a system prompt.

```python
def prepend_system_prompt_to_first_user_message(samples, system_prompt, path=None):
    new_samples = []
    for sample in samples:
        # Deep copy to avoid mutating the original
        sample_copy = json.loads(json.dumps(sample))
        messages = sample_copy.get("messages", [])
        if messages and messages[0].get("role") == "user" and isinstance(messages[0].get("content"), str):
            if not messages[0]["content"].startswith(system_prompt):
                messages[0]["content"] = f"{system_prompt}\n\n{messages[0]['content']}"
        new_samples.append(sample_copy)
    if path is not None:
        with open(path, "w", encoding="utf-8") as f:
            for item in new_samples:
                f.write(json.dumps(item, ensure_ascii=False) + "\n")
    return new_samples
```

```python
simple_prompt = """You are an expert clinician. For each clinical vignette, respond with exactly one phrase: the single most likely outcome or phenomenon, all in lowercase. 
- Do not add punctuation, articles, explanations, or commentary - output only the term itself.
- Sometimes, the expected answer can be a synonym of what you think.
- Use the standard clinical name (e.g. “thought withdrawal”, “Toxoplasma encephalitis”)."""
train_samples_loaded_simple_sys_prompt = prepend_system_prompt_to_first_user_message(
    train_samples_loaded, simple_prompt, path="data/medical_01_verifiable_problem_train_simple_prompt.jsonl"
)
test_samples_loaded_simple_sys_prompt = prepend_system_prompt_to_first_user_message(
    test_samples_loaded, simple_prompt, path="data/medical_01_verifiable_problem_val_simple_prompt.jsonl"
)
```

Then build a helper function to generate and store the model's predictions.

```python
from openai import OpenAI
import concurrent.futures
from tqdm import tqdm
import os

client = OpenAI()

def generate_model_predictions(
    subset,
    prompt_type,
    model_name="o4-mini-2025-04-16",
    reasoning_effort="medium",
    n_runs=1,
    verbose=False,
):
    if isinstance(subset, str):
        samples_path = f"data/medical_01_verifiable_problem_{subset}_{prompt_type}_prompt.jsonl"
        with open(samples_path, "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
            test_samples = [json.loads(line) for line in f if line.strip()]
    else:
        test_samples = [subset]

    def run_inference(item):
        resp = client.responses.create(
            model=model_name,
            input=item["messages"],
            reasoning={"effort": reasoning_effort, "summary": "detailed"},
        )
        model_prediction = {'output_text': resp.output_text}
        reasoning_tokens_used = resp.usage.output_tokens_details.reasoning_tokens
        summaries = [seg.text for item in resp.output if item.type == "reasoning" for seg in item.summary]
        summaries_string = "\n".join(summaries)
        if verbose:
            print("Prompt: {}".format(item["messages"][0]["content"]))
            print(f"Model Sample: {model_prediction}\nSolution: {item['reference_answer']}\n")
        return {
            "model_prediction": model_prediction["output_text"],
            "input": item,
            "reasoning_tokens_used": reasoning_tokens_used,
            "reference_answer": item["reference_answer"],
            "summaries": summaries_string
        }

    # Ensure the predictions directory exists before any file operations
    predictions_dir = os.path.join("data", "rft", "predictions")
    os.makedirs(predictions_dir, exist_ok=True)

    # Check if results already exist for all runs
    results_per_run = []
    for run_idx in range(n_runs):
        run_save_path = os.path.join(
            predictions_dir,
            f"{subset}_{prompt_type}_{model_name}_{reasoning_effort}_predictions_run{run_idx+1}.json"
        )
        if os.path.exists(run_save_path):
            print(f"Results for run {run_idx+1} already exist at {run_save_path}. Loading results.")
            with open(run_save_path, "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
                run_results = json.load(f)
            results_per_run.append(run_results)
        else:
            if len(test_samples) == 1:
                run_results = [run_inference(test_samples[0])]
            else:
                run_results = []
                with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:
                    futures = [executor.submit(run_inference, item) for item in test_samples]
                    for future in tqdm(futures, total=len(futures), desc=f"Generating predictions (run {run_idx+1})"):
                        result = future.result()
                        run_results.append(result)
                with open(run_save_path, "w", encoding="utf-8") as f:
                    json.dump(run_results, f, ensure_ascii=False, indent=2)
            results_per_run.append(run_results)

    # Return a flat list for backward compatibility
    if n_runs == 1:
        return results_per_run[0]
    else:
        return results_per_run
```

To generate the predictions, first make sure your API key is set:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=...
```

```python
# OpenAI o4-mini model
results_simple_o4mini = generate_model_predictions(
    subset="train",
    prompt_type="simple",
    model_name="o4-mini",
    reasoning_effort="medium",
    n_runs=3
)
```

```python
# OpenAI o3 model
results_simple_o3 = generate_model_predictions(
    subset="train",
    prompt_type="simple",
    model_name="o3",
    reasoning_effort="medium",
    n_runs=3
)
```

We now have predictions that are ready to be evaluated.<br>
We'll build a helper function that allows us to easily swap in different scoring methods,

```python
import functools

def evaluate_predictions_with_grader(
    predictions,
    grader_func=combined_grader,
):
    results = []

    if isinstance(predictions, dict):
        predictions = [predictions]

    def run_grading(pred):
        model_prediction = {"output_text": pred["model_prediction"]}
        item = pred["input"]
        score = grader_func(model_prediction, item)
        result = pred.copy()
        result["score"] = score
        return result

    if len(predictions) == 1:
        result = run_grading(predictions[0])
        results.append(result)
    else:
        with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:
            futures = [executor.submit(run_grading, pred) for pred in predictions]
            for future in tqdm(concurrent.futures.as_completed(futures), total=len(futures), desc="Grading predictions"):
                results.append(future.result())

    total = len(results)
    correct = sum(r["score"] for r in results)
    accuracy = correct / total if total else 0.0

    metrics = {
        "total_samples": total,
        "accuracy": accuracy,
    }
    print(metrics)
    return metrics, results

def run_prediction_evaluation(

        mg = grader_func.keywords["model_grader"]
        mg_name = mg["name"]
        name = f"{name}_{mg_name}"
    else:
        name = getattr(grader_func, "__name__", getattr(grader_func, "__class__", type(grader_func)).__name__)
    grader_func_name = name.replace(" ", "_").replace(":", "_").replace("/", "_").replace(",", "_")

    for i in range(num_runs):
        preds_path = f"data/rft/predictions/{subset}_{prompt_type}_{model_name}_{reasoning_effort}_predictions_run{i+1}.json"
        with open(preds_path, "r") as f:
            preds = json.load(f)
        metrics, results_with_scores = evaluate_predictions_with_grader(preds, grader_func=grader_func)
        # Save the scored results

def load_predictions(

    num_runs=3
):
    all_predictions = []

```

and then run the evaluations.

```python

Visualizing the results allows us to spot trends and failure modes.

```python
# Print mistakes where the model did not get the correct answer (score < 1.0)
mistakes = [
    {"index": i, **res}
    for i, res in enumerate(predictions_o4mini_medium_simple_prompt[0])
    if res["score"] < 1.0
]

print(f"\nTotal mistakes: {len(mistakes)}")
for m in mistakes[15:20]:
    print(f"\n[Sample {m['index']}]")
    print(f"  Model prediction: {m['model_prediction']}")
    print(f"  Reference answer: {m['reference_answer']}")
    print(f"  Score: {m['score']}")
```

```text

Total mistakes: 86

[Sample 18]
  Model prediction: acute anterior uveitis
  Reference answer: recurring eye redness and pain
  Score: 0.3596153846153846

[Sample 19]
  Model prediction: 390 meq
  Reference answer: 150 meq
  Score: 0.6071428571428571

  Score: 0.16190476190476194

[Sample 23]
  Model prediction: hypokalemia
  Reference answer: hypomagnesemia
  Score: 0.612
```

As observed above, typical failure modes fall into three categories:
1. Small differences and formatting issues, score >=0.8.
2. Partial lexical match, 0.3 < score < 0.8.
3. Lexically off-base, score < 0.3.

We can visualize the full score distribution on the training set.

> Note: In practice, analyzing model errors at scale often involves a mix of manual review and automated methods, such as tagging failure types or clustering predictions by score and content. That workflow is beyond the scope of this guide, but it's a valuable next step once you've identified broad patterns.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
scores_distribution = [m['score'] for m in predictions_o4mini_medium_simple_prompt[0]]
plt.hist(scores_distribution, alpha=0.6, label='o4-mini medium simple prompt')
plt.legend()
```

Let's compare with other models and prompts, and visualize scores.

```python

We can see that the modelʼs performance has clear limits. In practice, iterating on the prompt often helps boost baseline results and get more out of the base model. However, in this case, our prompt engineering didnʼt lead to meaningful improvements-so we excluded those runs from the analysis.


A key requirement for RFT to work is that the base model demonstrates it can successfully complete the task for at least some examples right out of the gate. The initial accuracy of ~0.6 is a strong signal that RFT can boost performance. If the model never succeeds on your tasks, there is no training signal to hill climb on.


This evaluation process prepares us for the next step: guiding the model with structured, high-quality feedback from a grader.

---


## **4. Defining Your Grader**

The grader defines the reward function that shapes model behavior during RFT. It provides examples of desired outputs-and penalizes undesirable ones. Designing an effective grader requires both principled structure and thoughtful domain insight, and is perhaps the most important task for successful RFT. 

In this section, we will present 3 graders, show how they should be set up to fit the API, and discuss the results they yielded. We will then show how to actually launch an RFT task. 

### String based grader
We began with a dual grader using our earlier evaluation functions since it provides a distribution of scores that will be aligned with the lexical proximity of the prediction to the reference answer. It provided a starting point, but the signal wasnʼt rich enough for `o4-mini` to truly learn and improve, and a first experiment showed stagnant reward during the RFT run. For the API calls, you should build the python grading function as shown below. 

```python
import inspect

# --- Utility functions ---
def build_python_grader_payload(grader_fn) :
    """Build a payload for a python grader."""
    grader_source = inspect.getsource(grader_fn)
    # Enforce function name to be `grade`
    grader_source = grader_source.replace(grader_fn.__name__, "grade", 1)
    return {
        "type": "python",
        "source": grader_source,
    }

multi_python_grader_tool_call = {
    "type": "multi",
    "graders": {
        "clinical_phrase": {
            "name": "clinical_phrase_grader",
            "image_tag": "2025-05-08",
            **build_python_grader_payload(clinical_phrase_grader),
        },
        "clinical_phrase_binary": {
            "name": "clinical_phrase_binary_grader",
            "image_tag": "2025-05-08",
            **build_python_grader_payload(clinical_phrase_binary_grader),
        },
    },
    "calculate_output": "0.85 * clinical_phrase + 0.15 * clinical_phrase_binary",
}
```

Here is a snapshot of its training curves, where the green curve is the training set reward and the blue curve is the test set reward:

![RFT String Grader](https://developers.openai.com/cookbook/assets/images/rft_string_grader.png)

### Model Grader 1
To address this limitation, we introduced a more advanced approach: the **model grader**. A model-based grader lets us embed semantic understanding and nuance into the feedback. Thatʼs especially powerful when domain-specific synonyms or fuzzy reasoning are in play. 

We used gpt-4.1 as our grader model, guided by a rubric that emphasized semantic fidelity: clinical synonymy, correct disease categorization, and conceptual alignment. Rather than focusing on superficial phrasing-e.g., "Is this the same string?"-the grader aimed to answer, "Does this reflect the correct outcome or phenomenon?" 

To ensure the grader aligned with expert expectations, we evaluated it on a subset of base model predictions. For any production use-case, domain expert reviewers should verify that model assigned scores reflect preferred answer orderings and align with domain judgment. This typically involves confirming that the model grader correctly ranks predictions according to their validity. In the scope of this cookbook, we approximated this evaluation by using OpenAI `o3` to check whether higher-quality predictions were consistently rewarded relative to their alternatives.

From these discussions of `o3` , we iteratively update the model grader until the results are aligned. 

```python
GRADER_PROMPT_1 = """
System:
  You are an expert medical grader. Compare the **Reference Answer** to the **Model's Answer** and produce **only** a JSON object with:
    • **result**: a float between 0.0 and 1.0  
    • **steps**: a list of reasoning steps (each with a `"description"` and a `"conclusion"`)

  Scoring rubric (start at 0.0, then add or subtract):
    1. Exact lexical match: **+0.15**  
    2. Clinical synonym (e.g. “withdrawal of thought” ↔ “thought withdrawal”): **+0.35**  
    3. Same disease family (e.g. two viral encephalitides): **+0.35**  
    4. Partial term overlap (e.g. “ulcer” in both phrases): **+0.15**  
    5. Completely unrelated: **-0.10**

  • If multiple criteria apply, sum their weights (max 1.0).  
  • Cap the final score to the [0.0, 1.0] range.  
  • In your **steps**, show which rule you applied and the running subtotal.
"""
```

To be submitted through the API, this is how the dictionary is built.

```python
model_grader_1 = {
   "type": "score_model",
   "name": "gpt41_score_model_1",
   "input": [
        {
            "role": "system",
            "content": GRADER_PROMPT_1
        },
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Reference Answer: {{item.reference_answer}}. Model's Answer: {{sample.output_text}}"
        }

   "range": [0, 1],
   "sampling_params": {
       "seed": 42,
       "temperature": 0,
   },
}
```

Accordingly, we set up the model grader locally to check the results of the models we will fine-tune next. 

```python

  "strict": True,

    "type": "object",
    "properties": {

            }
          },
          "required": ["description", "conclusion"],
          "additionalProperties": False
        }
      },

  }
}

response_format = {
    "type": "json_schema",
    "json_schema": response_format
}

# Adapted python_model_grader to match the other graders' interface
def python_model_grader(sample, item, model_grader=model_grader_1):

    """
    # Prepare the prompt as the grader expects
    system_prompt = model_grader["input"][0]["content"]
    user_prompt = model_grader["input"][1]["content"]
    user_prompt_filled = user_prompt.replace("{{item.reference_answer}}", item["reference_answer"]).replace("{{sample.output_text}}", sample["output_text"])
    messages = [
        {"role": "system", "content": system_prompt},
        {"role": "user", "content": user_prompt_filled}
    ]
    # Call the OpenAI API with the grader's model
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model=model_grader["model"],
        messages=messages,
        seed=model_grader.get("sampling_params", {}).get("seed", None),
        temperature=model_grader.get("sampling_params", {}).get("temperature", 0),
        response_format=response_format,
    )
    # Parse the float score from the model's JSON response
    parsed = json.loads(response.choices[0].message.content)
    
    return float(parsed["result"])
```

While the rubric initially delivered sensible feedback, the model soon uncovered a loophole and began **reward-hacking**. Scores shot up-sometimes by 20-30 percentage points-not because clinical accuracy improved but because the model padded its “one phrase” answers with synonyms, doses, and full management plans. You might see `begin warfarin therapy **and** continue unfractionated heparin for ≥5 days, overlapping until the INR is in the therapeutic range (2–3)` or `chewable aspirin 325 mg stat plus nitroglycerin…` instead of the required `continue unfractionated heparin` or `aspirin` respectively. Although the system prompt is explicit-*“respond with exactly one phrase: the single most likely outcome or phenomenon”*-these verbose outputs inflate *lexical_similarity* scores without precisely adding prediction value. This experience highlights the need to continuously inspect model outputs and remain vigilant for reward-hacking behaviours that can quietly distort evaluation metrics.

Here is a snapshot of its training curves (green is training reward, blue is test reward):

![RFT Model Hacking](https://developers.openai.com/cookbook/assets/images/rft_hacking.png)

### Model Grader 2
To mitigate this reward-hack, we refined the grader prompt by clarifying expectations, enforcing stricter output constraints, and supplying contrastive examples of correct versus incorrect behavior. Once again, we've iterated with `o3`, leveraging predictions from the base `o4-mini` and the previous fine-tuned model hacking examples, to design and validate our grader. Another important point of this updated grader is the reduction of the weight of the *lexical_similarity*, to ensure that *clinical_similarity* prevails.

```python

The final result was a high-signal, domain-sensitive grader that guided the model toward more appropriate and concise predictions.

**Note on cost:** LLM graders incur token usage charges in addition to training compute. To manage costs effectively, we recommend:
1. Testing your grader locally on base model completions (and optionally synthetic ones) to ensure it aligns with your rubric or human preferences. When available, use [flex processing](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/flex-processing) for more efficient evaluation.
2. Starting with a small-scale RFT run to validate grader alignment and detect potential reward-hacking before scaling up.

Let's look at how to launch the training in the next step!

---


## **5. Training**

Once your prompt and grader are finalized, you can proceed to training. This section shows how to launch RFT using your final grader-but naturally, you would have already run similar commands when experimenting with earlier grader versions to evaluate their performance.

We make sure the grader passed API test,

```python
import requests

API_KEY = os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"]
HEADERS = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {API_KEY}"}

# Validate a grader configuration for fine-tuning
payload = {"grader": model_grader_2}
try:
    response = requests.post(
        "https://api.openai.com/v1/fine_tuning/alpha/graders/validate",
        json=payload,
        headers=HEADERS,
    )
    response.raise_for_status()
    print("Grader validated")
except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
    print(f"Error validating grader: {e}")
    if 'response' in locals():
        print(f"Response: {response.text}")
```

```text
Grader validated
```

and upload the training and test sets to the OpenAI file system.

```python
# Set your training and test file paths
train_file = "data/medical_01_verifiable_problem_train_simple_prompt.jsonl"
test_file = "data/medical_01_verifiable_problem_val_simple_prompt.jsonl"

def upload_file(file_path: str) -> str:
    """Upload a file to the OpenAI platform for fine-tuning."""
    print(f"Uploading file: {file_path}")
    with open(file_path, 'rb') as f:
        response = requests.post(
            "https://api.openai.com/v1/files",
            headers=HEADERS,
            files={"file": f},
            data={"purpose": "fine-tune"}
        )
        response.raise_for_status()
        file_id = response.json()["id"]
        print(f"File uploaded successfully. File ID: {file_id}")
        return file_id

train_file_id = train_file
if train_file.endswith("jsonl"):
    print(f"Training file detected: {train_file}")
    train_file_id = upload_file(train_file)
test_file_id = test_file
if test_file and test_file.endswith("jsonl"):
    print(f"test file detected: {test_file}")
    test_file_id = upload_file(test_file)
```

```text

```

Let's now define the hyper-parameters for our run. We will be fine-tuning `o4-mini`, with the `medium` reasoning effort. This parameter will impact the duration by limiting the number of tokens the model uses to reason. We tune with a moderate compute multiplier and reasonable number of epochs, prioritizing efficiency and fast iteration. Additionally, we set the `eval_samples` parameter to 3 to make the validation curves more robust given the stochasticity of `o4-mini`’s outputs. Averaging across multiple samples reduces noise and helps reveal consistent patterns of learning.

You’ll want to tailor these depending on your budget, desired generalization, and dataset difficulty.

```python
# Set the model and other parameters
model = "o4-mini-2025-04-16"
suffix = "medical_01_verifiable_problem_gpt41_grader"
reasoning_effort = "medium"
n_epochs = 5
seed = 42
grader = model_grader_2

We are now ready to launch the run!

On the [dashboard](https://platform.openai.com/finetune/) you can observe the reward plots - they let you watch overall performance improve across steps, while the per-grader charts break down specific components in the case of a *multi_grader*. Reasoning token usage trends (often decreasing as the model gets more confident) and step duration metrics give insight into efficiency. Grader latency and error count plots help ensure your grader stays performant and bug-free during the run.

Here is a snapshot of our training curves, where the green and orange curves are for the training set, while the blue and red curves are for the test subset:

![RFT Dashboard Example](https://developers.openai.com/cookbook/assets/images/rft_dashboard_modelgrader2.png)

During training, evaluation runs on the test set are logged directly to the [Evaluation API](https://platform.openai.com/evaluations?tab=runs). You can head there to track how your samples perform and get a sense of how predictions evolve over time.

## **6. Using Your Fine-Tuned Model**

When training completes, you can call your new model by its `model_id` and benchmark its improvements. Expect sharper predictions! 


```python
# To retrieve information about a fine-tuning job (including the fine-tuned model id), use the job_id:
response = requests.get(
    f"https://api.openai.com/v1/fine_tuning/jobs/{job_id}",
    headers=HEADERS,
)
if response.ok:
    data = response.json()
    if data.get("status") == "succeeded":
        fine_tuned_model_id = data.get("fine_tuned_model")
    else:
        fine_tuned_model_id = None
else:
    raise Exception(f"Request failed: {response.status_code} - {response.text}")
print("Fine-tuned model id:", fine_tuned_model_id)
```

    print(f"\n[Sample {m['index']}]")

    print(f"  Score: {m['score']}")
```

```text

  Score: 0.428

```

We see about a 5-point boost in accuracy after fine-tuning. Looking at the first few errors, the model tends to harshly penalize answers that are close but not clinically identical-like *unfractionated heparin* vs. *enoxaparin*. It also dings longer answers, even when they’re correct, like *contrast enhanced computed tomography of the abdomen*.

```python
scores_o4 = [p['score'] for p in predictions_o4mini_medium_simple_prompt_model_grader_2[0]]
scores_ft = [p['score'] for p in predictions_ftmodel_medium_simple_prompt_model_grader_2[0]]

# Determine common bins for both histograms
all_scores = scores_o4 + scores_ft
bins = plt.hist(all_scores, bins=5, alpha=0)[1]

# Plot histograms and capture the counts
counts_o4, _, _ = plt.hist(
    scores_o4,
    bins=bins,
    alpha=0.6,
    label='o4-mini-medium-simple-prompt'
)
counts_ft, _, _ = plt.hist(
    scores_ft,
    bins=bins,
    alpha=0.6,
    label='ftmodel-medium-simple-prompt'
)

plt.title("Model Grader 2 Score Distribution by Model")
plt.xlabel("Score")

plt.ylim(top=75)
plt.legend()

# Print the bin counts
print("o4-mini-medium-simple-prompt bin counts:", counts_o4)
print("ftmodel-medium-simple-prompt bin counts:", counts_ft)
print("Max bin count (y-axis):", max(max(counts_o4), max(counts_ft)))
```

```text

ftmodel-medium-simple-prompt bin counts: [ 3. 12.  9.  6. 70.]
Max bin count (y-axis): 70.0
```

![](https://developers.openai.com/cookbook/assets/notebook-outputs/examples/reinforcement_fine_tuning/cell-70-output-1.png)

The score distribution shows that RFT shifted the model’s predictions out of the mid-to-low range (0.2-0.6) and into the high range (0.8-1.0). Because the grader emphasizes clinical similarity over lexical match, our *expert* grader attributes this shift to stronger medical reasoning rather than better phrasing. A handful of already weak predictions fell into the 0.0-0.1 range, suggesting a residual knowledge gap.

Note that, because the earlier `combined_grader` was designed to reward lexical correctness, its accuracy didnʼt improve much-which is expected. That gap reinforces why validating your model grader is critical, and why you should monitor for reward-hacking. In our case, we used `o3` to spot-check grading behavior, but domain expert review is essential. 

### Model's reasoning

Another important point in the analysis of the fine-tuned model are the reasoning summaries. The model may provide key information throughout these summaries, and exploring them to understand where the model fails can drive updates in the model's and the grader's system prompts. Below, we show examples of such chain of thought summaries that the model produced to show its way of answering the question:

```python
# Flatten the list of lists into a single list of dicts
predictions = {
    "o4-mini": predictions_o4mini_medium_simple_prompt_model_grader_2,
    "o3": predictions_o3_medium_simple_prompt_model_grader_2,
    "ftmodel": predictions_ftmodel_medium_simple_prompt_model_grader_2,
}

for model_name, predictions in predictions.items():
    all_preds = [item for sublist in predictions for item in sublist]
    reasoning_tokens = [p['reasoning_tokens_used'] for p in all_preds if 'reasoning_tokens_used' in p]
    mean_reasoning_tokens = np.mean(reasoning_tokens)
    print(f"Mean reasoning_tokens_used {model_name}: {mean_reasoning_tokens:.0f}")
```

```text
Mean reasoning_tokens_used o4-mini: 404
Mean reasoning_tokens_used o3: 384
Mean reasoning_tokens_used ftmodel: 925
```

The fine-tuned model spends more reasoning tokens to think through the question. Let's visualize an example thanks to the reasoning summaries.

```python
from IPython.display import Markdown, display
markdown_text = results_o4mini_model_grader_2[0][30]["summaries"]
display(Markdown(markdown_text))
```

```text
**Choosing imaging study**

The user is looking for a single phrase regarding the imaging study for a 49-year-old male with chronic alcohol consumption and related symptoms. I'm considering whether to suggest a CT scan or MRI; however, a CT scan is often the initial choice for chronic pancreatitis. I’ll go with "abdominal ct scan" since it's standardized. I need to ensure I format it in lowercase without punctuation, following the user’s request. So the output is "abdominal ct scan."
```

```python
markdown_text = results_ft_model_grader_2[0][30]["summaries"]
display(Markdown(markdown_text))
```

```text
**Considering imaging options**

I'm analyzing the user's question about a 49-year-old male with symptoms suggesting steatorrhea, possibly indicating exocrine pancreatic insufficiency from chronic alcohol use. It raises concerns about chronic pancreatitis or pancreatic cancer. I think the best imaging choice is a contrast-enhanced CT scan of the abdomen because it effectively examines structural abnormalities. Alternatively, an endoscopic ultrasound could be more sensitive, but CT is generally preferred. So, my recommendation is to start with a contrast-enhanced CT scan.
**Determining the appropriate imaging study**

I'm analyzing the question about the most suitable imaging study for a patient with symptoms suggesting chronic pancreatitis. The standard approach for suspected chronic pancreatitis is a contrast-enhanced CT scan of the abdomen, as it effectively identifies pancreatic calcifications and structural changes. While MRCP and endoscopic ultrasound provide additional details, CT is often preferred as the initial test. Therefore, my answer should focus on recommending a "contrast-enhanced abdominal CT" as the next step in evaluation.
```

Base `o4‑mini`’s reasoning zooms straight to “abdominal CT scan,” mostly worrying about lowercase formatting and giving only a cursory “often the initial choice” justification. The `finetuned model`, meanwhile, first links the patient’s steatorrhea and alcohol history to chronic pancreatitis or cancer, weighs CT against MRCP and EUS, and explains why a contrast‑enhanced abdominal CT best reveals calcifications and structural change. The latter seems more careful, and seems to have learnt to break down the case description even more.

### To push the scores further
Both the baseline `o3` and our fine-tuned `o4-mini` sometimes scored zero on the same samples-a red flag that the reference labels may be wrong. Before adding more compute, invest in data quality: have a domain expert relabel the noisy slice, analyze the model's reasoning, then tighten the grader prompt. Clean, trusted data and methodical updates almost always buys more accuracy than extra epochs.


---


## **Conclusion**

Weʼve looked at how to design graders that give `o4-mini` the kind of detailed feedback it needs during RFT. That signal is what helps the model actually learn and improve beyond the baseline. Model graders can be incredibly powerful for this-but only if theyʼre designed carefully. A sloppy grader or sloppy data can send the wrong signals and steer the model in the wrong direction. 

You're now ready to apply reinforcement fine-tuning on your own models using the OpenAI API. Weʼre excited to see how you push the boundaries of reasoning and tool use with custom graders and smarter model behavior!
