# Build a prior authorization review assistant with the OpenAI Agents SDK and Amazon Bedrock AgentCore

> For the complete documentation index, see [llms.txt](/llms.txt). Markdown versions of documentation pages are available by appending `.md` to the page URL.

This notebook shows how to turn a sample prior authorization submission and public Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) policy documents into a cited assessment for a human payer reviewer. The application assesses each policy criterion and selects a review queue. It does not issue a coverage decision.

You will use the OpenAI Agents SDK with OpenAI models on Amazon Bedrock, retrieve policy text from a Bedrock Managed Knowledge Base, validate the result in application code, and deploy the same Python application to Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Runtime. The notebook and its adjacent [`prior_authorization_agentcore`](https://developers.openai.com/cookbook/examples/partners/aws/prior_authorization_agentcore/) support folder do not require the companion workshop or its user interface.

The member, submission, and clinical evidence are synthetic. The CMS pages are public sources, but their mapping to the sample payer policy is specific to this example and should not be used as coverage guidance. Only a qualified reviewer can record the final disposition.


## What you will build

A successful run returns `review_ready` with the selected CMS sources, an assessment of each policy criterion, and a queue for human review. The request follows these steps:

1. Extract text from the sample provider PDF and verify expected report fields.
2. Resolve the request's policy ID and version to criteria stored in application configuration.
3. Retrieve matching CMS policy text with managed hybrid search and reranking, then validate its identity, source, and score.
4. Use Luna to inventory the submitted evidence, Terra to map that evidence to the policy criteria, and Sol to produce the final assessment.
5. Validate citations and review routing in Python before returning the result.

The generated application creates three separate OpenAI Agents SDK `Agent` objects inside one AgentCore Runtime. It invokes them sequentially—not in parallel—and each agent uses its matching OpenAI GPT-5.6 model through Amazon Bedrock:

| Agent | Invocation in this notebook | Responsibility |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GPT-5.6 Luna | Required for the mixed note and PDF evidence | Inventory and normalize submitted evidence |
| GPT-5.6 Terra | Required after Luna | Map evidence to every policy criterion |
| GPT-5.6 Sol | Required after Terra | Recheck citations and produce the human-review queue |

Application code fixes the order and validates every handoff; no agent selects the next stage. If you adapt this pattern for structured-only submissions, make the Luna bypass an application-owned rule rather than a model decision.

The application has no local retrieval fallback. If the Knowledge Base returns no eligible policy, the application returns `policy_mapping_required` before it configures or calls a model. The local HTTP test and the managed AgentCore Runtime use the same generated application.


## 1. Configure the environment

You need Python 3.12, Node.js 20 or later, `npm`, `npx`, and short-lived AWS credentials. Clone the repository and run the notebook from the repository root or `examples/partners/AWS` so it can import the adjacent [`prior_authorization_agentcore`](https://developers.openai.com/cookbook/examples/partners/aws/prior_authorization_agentcore/) folder. The AWS identity must be able to use the services enabled in the cells you choose to run: CloudFormation, Amazon S3, Bedrock Managed Knowledge Bases, OpenAI models on Amazon Bedrock, and AgentCore Runtime. The setup cell installs the pinned Python dependencies, including `pypdf` for the sample attachment. Managed Knowledge Bases are not available in every AWS Region; this notebook defaults to `us-east-1`.

Set `AWS_REGION` and, when needed, `AWS_PROFILE`. Then choose one Knowledge Base setup:

1. Set `BEDROCK_KNOWLEDGE_BASE_ID` to an existing Bedrock Managed Knowledge Base that already contains the CMS source set and metadata used by this notebook.
2. Set `PROVISION_KB = True` in the configuration cell to create and populate a Bedrock Managed Knowledge Base.

Using an existing Knowledge Base requires `bedrock:GetKnowledgeBase` so the notebook can verify its type and `bedrock:Retrieve` for the retrieval checks.

Managed deployment also requires `AGENTCORE_EXECUTION_ROLE_ARN`. To invoke an existing Runtime instead, set `AGENTCORE_RUNTIME_ARN`. Optional role controls include `BEDROCK_KB_ROLE_ARN`, `BEDROCK_KB_ROLE_PATH`, and `BEDROCK_KB_PERMISSIONS_BOUNDARY_ARN`. You can also override `BEDROCK_KB_MIN_SCORE`, `BEDROCK_KB_RESULT_COUNT`, `BEDROCK_MODEL_STAGE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`, `BEDROCK_KB_STACK_NAME`, `BEDROCK_KB_RESOURCE_PREFIX`, `AGENTCORE_RUNTIME_NAME`, and `AGENTCORE_ARTIFACT_BUCKET`.

`POLICY_REVIEW_DATA_CLASSIFICATION` defaults to `synthetic`. Set it to `customer-governed` only after the target environment and data handling controls have been approved.

The creation, paid-call, deployment, and cleanup flags default to `False`. Enable only the cells that the target AWS account owner has authorized.

## 2. Define the sample case and policy mapping

The Knowledge Base contains two public CMS Medicare Coverage Database pages for home oxygen. Metadata maps both pages to the sample policy `NSH-DME-022` while retaining the CMS document ID, URL, checksum, authority, and retrieval score for each result. This mapping is part of the example; it does not establish coverage for a real payer or Medicare Administrative Contractor jurisdiction.

The prior authorization case uses a sample payer named Northstar Health and a synthetic member. The request contains the policy ID and version but not the policy criteria. The generated application loads those criteria from its own configuration so that a caller cannot replace them.

The repository includes a [sample room-air oximetry and arterial blood gas report](https://developers.openai.com/cookbook/assets/examples/partners/aws/data/policy_to_review/pa-oxy-2088-room-air-oximetry-abg.pdf). The notebook extracts the text, checks expected report fields, records the file checksum, and adds the text to the case as `OXY-TEST-1`. The PDF is clinical evidence and is not uploaded to the policy Knowledge Base.

## 3. Create or select the Bedrock Managed Knowledge Base

When `PROVISION_KB = True`, the CloudFormation template creates a private encrypted S3 source bucket and a Bedrock Managed Knowledge Base with a service-managed embedding model, managed storage, and an S3 connector. Retrieval combines keyword and semantic matching and applies the service-managed reranker after the application supplies exact policy-applicability filters. When the flag is `False`, the notebook uses `BEDROCK_KNOWLEDGE_BASE_ID` and creates nothing.

Set `BEDROCK_KB_ROLE_ARN` to reuse an existing service role. Otherwise, the stack creates a least-privilege role trusted by `bedrock.amazonaws.com`. Use `BEDROCK_KB_ROLE_PATH` and `BEDROCK_KB_PERMISSIONS_BOUNDARY_ARN` when your organization requires them. The managed stack name and source-bucket suffix differ from the earlier S3 Vectors version, so this notebook does not replace that architecture in place. If the managed stack already exists, the notebook may update it but will not treat it as eligible for cleanup.

Hybrid retrieval improves recall for exact identifiers and related clinical language, but ranked passages do not prove that every dependency, exclusion, or cross-reference across a policy corpus has been found. A production adjudication system that must evaluate those relationships exhaustively should add a governed policy graph or formal rules layer and validate it separately.

from prior_authorization_agentcore.knowledge_base import (

## 4. Ingest the CMS documents

For a stack created during the current run, this cell downloads the CMS pages, checks expected page markers, calculates SHA-256 checksums, and uploads each HTML document with a `.metadata.json` sidecar. It then starts one ingestion job and waits for completion.

The cell does not modify an existing Knowledge Base. A later retrieval check confirms whether that Knowledge Base contains the required source documents.

## 5. Generate the AgentCore application

The next cells load the application files from the adjacent [`prior_authorization_agentcore/runtime_source`](https://developers.openai.com/cookbook/examples/partners/aws/prior_authorization_agentcore/runtime_source/) folder and create a standalone Python project. The project contains Pydantic request and response models, an application-owned policy registry, Bedrock Managed Knowledge Base retrieval, the three-agent OpenAI Agents SDK workflow, and an AgentCore Runtime entry point.

The request supplies only a policy ID and version. The application loads the corresponding criteria, retrieves CMS text with payer, plan, service-code, status, and effective-date filters, and checks the returned policy ID, version, authority, URL, and score before it configures a model. The models do not select the Knowledge Base, policy, source documents, agent order, or coverage disposition.

The policy registry keeps this example self-contained. A production implementation should load the same normalized criteria from a governed policy-management system.


```python
from prior_authorization_agentcore.runtime_project import (
    load_runtime_source,
    render_policy_registry_source,
)

MODELS_SOURCE = load_runtime_source("models.py")

    TRUSTED_POLICY_DEFINITIONS
)
print(
    "Loaded typed contracts and the application-owned policy registry."
)

## 6. Validate the application and retrieval order

The local checks compile the generated Python files and run the pinned AgentCore CLI with `npx` (which may download that CLI version on first use). They also confirm that the request cannot supply policy criteria, unknown policy references are rejected, each agent returns the expected case and evidence IDs, citations quote their sources, criterion statuses agree with the selected review queue, and missing-information fields agree with unknown criteria.

A controlled test replaces the Knowledge Base client with an empty result and confirms that the entry point uses managed search and managed reranking, then returns `policy_mapping_required` without configuring a model and with zero token usage. The live retrieval check makes one read-only `Retrieve` request and prints the selected policy, CMS source URLs, retrieval score, filters, and document IDs.

No matching policy is a supported result. Missing configuration, AWS connection errors, multiple policy identities, non-CMS sources, and scores below `BEDROCK_KB_MIN_SCORE` raise errors.


```python
if shutil.which("node") is None or shutil.which("npx") is None:
    raise RuntimeError("Node.js 20+ and npx are required for AgentCore CLI.")
node_version = subprocess.check_output(

## 8. Validate the review result

The models return typed objects, and the application checks those objects before returning them. Clinical citations must quote the submitted evidence. Policy citations must name a selected CMS document and URL and quote text from one of its retrieved chunks. Paraphrased or unsupported policy citations are rejected.

The final validator checks the Knowledge Base, case, policy, criteria, and citations. It derives the required status and review queue from the criterion statuses and checks whether missing information is required. It also rejects approval or denial labels and requires `expertReviewRequired` to be `true`.

## 9. Run the prompt regression cases

The optional regression set covers four versions of the sample case: complete evidence, a missing qualifying test, conflicting test results, and an instruction embedded in a clinical note. The graders check the expected criterion status and queue, citation support, Knowledge Base identity, model order, token usage, and the absence of a coverage disposition.

Set `RUN_PROMPT_EVALS = True` only for an authorized, billable run. One pass makes four Knowledge Base `Retrieve` requests and 12 model calls but creates no AWS resources. The expected outcomes are regression labels for this example, not clinically validated decisions. Have a payer utilization-management expert review the cases and graders before adapting them for production.

## 10. Deploy to AgentCore Runtime

Set `DEPLOY_AGENTCORE = True` only after you review the generated project and receive authorization for the target account. The deployment cell packages the Python 3.12 application and pinned dependencies for the AgentCore CodeZip runtime on ARM64 and Amazon Linux 2023, uploads the archive to a private S3 bucket, and calls the AgentCore control-plane API. AWS CDK bootstrap is not required for this path.

Set `AGENTCORE_EXECUTION_ROLE_ARN` to a pre-created role in the current AWS account. The role must:

- Trust `bedrock-agentcore.amazonaws.com`.
- Allow the logging, metrics, and tracing actions required by AgentCore Runtime.
- Read the CodeZip object from S3.
- Invoke the configured OpenAI models on Amazon Bedrock.
- Call `bedrock:Retrieve` on the configured Knowledge Base.

Apply any role path or permissions boundary required by your organization. Restrict the trust policy with `aws:SourceAccount` and `aws:SourceArn` when those values are known. The notebook does not create an execution role or long-lived model credentials.

## 11. Inspect the Runtime and optionally clean up

After a managed invocation, the inspection cell reads the Runtime version and status and checks for recent CloudWatch log streams. These checks confirm that the managed Runtime executed; the response validators are what confirm the selected policy, criteria, and citations.

Cleanup uses separate opt-in flags. Delete the Runtime before deleting its Knowledge Base. `CLEAN_UP_AGENTCORE` can delete only a Runtime created during the current notebook run, and `CLEAN_UP_KB` can delete only a stack created during the current run. Updating an existing resource does not make it eligible for cleanup.

The notebook records ownership as soon as AWS accepts a create request and retains it across cell retries in the same kernel. Restarting the kernel clears that state; the notebook will not infer ownership of an existing resource.


```python
if runtime_arn:
    inspected_runtime_id = runtime_id or runtime_arn.rsplit("/", 1)[-1]

## Expected results

Use these checkpoints to verify a run:

- The Knowledge Base setup reports `knowledge_base_type="MANAGED"` and `retrieval="hybrid search with managed reranking"`.
- The retrieval check prints policy `NSH-DME-022`, version `2026.1`, CMS source URLs, document IDs, and a score at or above `BEDROCK_KB_MIN_SCORE`.
- A successful local or managed invocation returns `outcome="review_ready"`, four criterion assessments, a review queue, and `coverageDisposition="NOT_PERFORMED"`.
- An empty Knowledge Base result returns `outcome="policy_mapping_required"` with no requested models and zero token usage.
- The optional regression run reports whether each of its four cases passed every application-owned grader.
- The managed invocation returns the same response contract as the local HTTP endpoint.
