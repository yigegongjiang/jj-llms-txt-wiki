If your feed uses a Google-compatible product data format, OpenAI will use that
formatting; see the [Google product data
specification](https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/7052112?hl=en#basic_product_data)
for field definitions.



<h2 id="feed-reference">Feed Reference</h2>

      This reference defines the shared flat-file schema that OpenAI ingests and
      indexes. For a non-Ads product feed, follow the Required and Optional
      labels on this page. Ads product feeds follow the [Ads product feeds
      guide](https://developers.openai.com/ads/product-feeds#use-the-correct-feed-schema) and use the same
      base schema plus its additional eligibility requirement.

      Each table below groups fields by schema object and indicates whether a
      field is Required or Optional for a non-Ads feed, along with validation
      rules to help your engineering team build and maintain a compliant upload
      file.

      Supplying all required fields ensures your products can be displayed
      correctly. For Ads processing, also set `is_ads_eligible` to `true` on
      each product that Ads should process.




### Google-compatible product data feeds

If OpenAI confirms that your registered feed supports this format, you can
upload a compatible delimited product data feed without renaming its columns to
OpenAI field names. Otherwise, continue to use the OpenAI specification. OpenAI
maps the supported input fields into the stable product schema.

This compatibility path covers the core profile described in this section. It
does not support every program, market, attribute, or feed representation. For
field definitions, see the [product data specification](https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/7052112?hl=en#basic_product_data).

#### Meet the core requirements

- Upload a UTF-8, tab-delimited `.txt` or `.tsv` file, or a comma-delimited
  `.csv` file. Gzip-compressed `.txt.gz`, `.txt.gzip`, `.tsv.gz`, and `.csv.gz`
  files are also supported.
- Include one header row with canonical lowercase, underscore-separated field
  names. For example, use `image_link`. `.txt` uploads also accept common
  space-separated display labels such as `image link`. `g:`-prefixed XML names
  are not supported.
- Include one product or variant per row.
- Include `id`, `title`, `description`, `link`, `image_link`, `availability`,
  `price`, and `brand` on every row.
- Use plain `title` and `description` values. Structured title and description
  alternatives are not mapped.
- Use valid HTTP or HTTPS URLs for `link` and `image_link`.
- Write `price` as an amount followed by a three-letter currency code. If OpenAI
  confirms market-specific processing for your registered feed, use a currency
  configured for that feed. Most products require a positive amount. A zero
  price passes validation only for supported mobile-device categories with a
  valid `subscription_cost`. If present, `sale_price` must be positive, use the
  same currency, and be less than `price`.
- Provide a valid `gtin` or `mpn` when you omit `identifier_exists` or set it to
  `yes`. Set `identifier_exists` to `no` only when the product genuinely has no
  identifier.
- Include `availability_date` when `availability` is `preorder` or `backorder`.

Register a merchant display name that contains at least one non-whitespace
character and is not a placeholder such as `unknown`, `null`, or `n/a`. OpenAI
trims and uses that registered name as the seller identity on every row. An
uploaded `seller_name` cannot override it.

If OpenAI confirms market-specific processing for the registered feed, OpenAI
applies its configured currencies and target countries. In that case, OpenAI
rejects products whose price currency is not configured for the feed.

JSON, spreadsheet, XML, RSS, and Atom sources are not part of this compatibility
path. Export a supported delimited product data feed before uploading it.

#### How OpenAI selects the parser

OpenAI automatically selects one parser for each upload:

1. OpenAI samples records from every eligible file and checks the OpenAI product
   schema first. Empty files do not contribute a sample.
2. If the OpenAI parser does not accept at least one sampled record from every
   file that yielded records, OpenAI checks the Google-compatible profile.
3. OpenAI selects the Google-compatible profile only if it accepts at least one
   sampled record from each file that yielded records.
4. OpenAI uses the selected parser for every eligible file and row. It does not
   switch parsers from row to row.

A feed that matches the OpenAI schema keeps OpenAI field semantics. Selecting a
parser does not guarantee that every row is valid: each row is still validated
during processing. If neither sampled profile matches, OpenAI keeps the OpenAI
parser and reports its validation errors.

| `product_type`, `google_product_category`          | `product_category`                             | Uses the first nonempty comma-separated `product_type`; otherwise uses `google_product_category`.                                                          |

| `item_group_title`                                 | `item_group_title`                             | Copied when provided.                                                                                                                                      |
| `color`, `size`, `material`, `age_group`, `gender` | Same field names and `variant_dict`            | Normalizes the matching OpenAI field. For grouped variants, adds the trimmed input value to `variant_dict`.                                                |
| `pattern`, `size_type`                             | `variant_dict`                                 | Adds the value to `variant_dict` for grouped variants.                                                                                                     |

For accepted products, OpenAI enables search and disables checkout. For an Ads
feed, Ads eligibility comes from the registered feed configuration. Uploaded
eligibility fields do not override these settings.

For Ads feeds, OpenAI retains selected Google-compatible fields for product
filtering in Ads campaigns. This dynamically configured set currently includes
`custom_label_0` through `custom_label_4` and a few other key columns. The
available fields may change over time.

#### Zero-price validation

For the zero-price exception, `google_product_category` must identify a
supported mobile-device category and `subscription_cost` must use
`month|year:positive integer:positive amount CURRENCY`. Its currency must match
`price`.

Uploaded `url`, `seller_url`, eligibility, checkout, return-policy, and Ads
control fields do not control the normalized product. An uploaded `url` or
`seller_url` that contains a username or password rejects the row. OpenAI
redacts the credential from the validation details.

Upload History reports missing required columns and values in supported fields
that fail validation. OpenAI can reject one malformed product while other valid
rows in the upload continue processing.


### OpenAI Flags

Use these flags to control whether a product is discoverable or purchasable
inside ChatGPT. These fields do not affect how the product is displayed on your
own site. They simply enable or disable the ChatGPT integrations.

The `Requirement` column and `Required fields only` filter describe non-Ads
feeds unless a row says otherwise. For Ads product feeds, see the [Ads product
feeds guide](https://developers.openai.com/ads/product-feeds#use-the-correct-feed-schema).

| is_eligible_checkout | Boolean   | `true`, `false`  | Allows direct purchase inside ChatGPT. `is_eligible_search` must be `true` for `is_eligible_checkout` to be enabled for the product. | `true`  | Required                                                | Requires `is_eligible_search=true` | Lower-case string |
| is_ads_eligible      | Boolean   | `true`, `false`  | Controls whether the product can be processed for ChatGPT ads. Use `is_eligible_ads` only as a legacy alias.                         | `true`  | Required for Ads processing; optional for non-Ads feeds | —                                  | Lower-case string |

### Basic Product Data

Provide the core identifiers and descriptive text needed to uniquely reference
each product. These fields establish the canonical record that ChatGPT Search
uses to display and link to your product.

### Merchant Info

`marketplace_seller` in your feed. The `marketplace_seller` would be the point
of checkout in this scenario, and the `seller_name` would be the shipment
fulfiller.
