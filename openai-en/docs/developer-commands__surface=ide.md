Use these commands to control Codex from the VS Code Command Palette. You can also bind them to keyboard shortcuts.

## Assign a key binding

To assign or change a key binding for a Codex command:

1. Open the Command Palette (**Cmd+Shift+P** on macOS or **Ctrl+Shift+P** on Windows/Linux).
2. Run **Preferences: Open Keyboard Shortcuts**.
3. Search for `Codex` or the command ID (for example, `chatgpt.newChat`).
4. Select the pencil icon, then enter the shortcut you want.

Slash commands let you control Codex without leaving the composer. Use them to check status, switch between local and cloud mode, or send feedback.

## Use a slash command

1. In the Codex composer, type `/`.
2. Select a command from the list, or keep typing to filter (for example, `/status`).
3. Press **Enter**.
