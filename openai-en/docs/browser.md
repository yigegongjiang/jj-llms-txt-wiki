Browser isn't available in Codex CLI or the Codex IDE extension. Open the
  ChatGPT desktop app to use the built-in browser.

</ContentModeSwitch>

Browser lets ChatGPT open websites, gather current information, and take action
while you stay in control. Use it to compare options, complete a multi-step task
on a website, or review a page you're building.

Browser is available in ChatGPT on the web and in the ChatGPT desktop app.

Treat page content as untrusted context. Review the site and proposed action
before sharing sensitive information or allowing ChatGPT to act.

<ContentModeSwitch group="codex-surface" ids="app,cli,ide">

The built-in browser in the ChatGPT desktop app gives you and ChatGPT a shared
view of websites and local web apps inside a chat. Use it to preview a page,
leave visual feedback, or let ChatGPT interact with a site on your behalf.

The built-in browser uses a browser profile that is separate from your regular
browser. It doesn't automatically share your existing tabs or browser session.
You can sign in directly when a task requires an account. Open **Settings >
Browser** to manage browser data and any profile-import features available on
your device.

Browser downloads go to your system Downloads folder by default. In **Settings >
Browser**, you can choose another download location, reset it to the system
default, or turn on **Ask where to save downloads**.

Use the [Chrome extension](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/chrome-extension) instead when ChatGPT needs
to work in an existing Chrome tab or use your regular Chrome profile.

Open the built-in browser from the toolbar, by clicking a URL, by navigating
manually, or by pressing <kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>B</kbd>
(<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>B</kbd> on Windows).

## Search from the address bar

Start typing in the built-in browser's address bar to find pages from its
browsing history. Select a matching page to reopen it, or enter a search term
to search Google when no history result matches.

The built-in browser keeps its own profile and browsing history. Results don't
automatically include pages from your regular Chrome profile or other browsers.

## Manage browsing history

Open **Settings > Browser** to search the built-in browser's history, reopen a
visited page, or remove history entries when your organization permits it. Use
**Clear browsing data** to choose a time range and the types of browsing data
you want to remove.

When available, ChatGPT can ask to search your browsing history to find a page
that matters to the current task. Review the request before allowing access.
Browsing history can include internal URLs, search terms, and other sensitive
information, so allow it only when the task requires that context.

## Computer Use in the browser

In the desktop app, Computer Use lets ChatGPT Work or Codex operate the
built-in browser directly. The selected experience can open pages, click, type,
inspect rendered state, take screenshots, and verify the result of its work in
the page.

Open the **Plugins** tab and install **Browser**. Then ask ChatGPT or Codex to
use the browser in your task, or reference it directly with `@Browser`.

For example:

```text
Use the browser to open http://localhost:3000/settings, reproduce the layout
bug, and fix only the overflowing controls.
```

ChatGPT asks before it uses a website unless you have already allowed that
site. Manage allowed and blocked sites in **Settings > Browser**. ChatGPT also
asks for confirmation before sensitive actions such as submitting information,
making a purchase, changing permissions, or deleting data. ChatGPT can't
automate file uploads in the built-in browser.

Instructions on a page can be misleading or malicious. A website permission
  lets ChatGPT interact with that site; it doesn't make the site's content
  trustworthy or approve every action.

## Preview a page

1. Start your app's development server in the [integrated terminal](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/integrated-terminal) or with a [local environment action](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/environments/local-environment#actions).
2. Open the local route, file-backed page, or public page by clicking a URL or
   navigating manually in the browser.
3. Review the rendered state alongside the code diff.
4. Leave browser comments on the elements or areas that need changes.
5. Ask ChatGPT to address the comments and keep the scope narrow.

For example:

```text
I left comments on the pricing page in the built-in browser. Address the mobile
layout issues and keep the card structure unchanged.
```

## Comment on the page

When a bug is visible only in the rendered page, use browser comments to give
ChatGPT precise feedback.

1. Turn on **Annotation mode**.
2. Click an element, or drag to select an area.
3. Write and save your comment.
4. Send a message in the chat asking ChatGPT to address the comments.

Comments work best when you name the problem and the result you want:

```text
This button overflows on mobile. Keep the label on one line if it fits,
otherwise wrap it without changing the card height.
```

```text
This tooltip covers the data point under the cursor. Reposition the tooltip so
it stays inside the chart bounds.
```

<section class="feature-grid">




### Styling feedback

When you add an annotation to a section on the page, select **Adjust** next to
the text input to give ChatGPT more granular style feedback. You can change
values such as font, text, spacing, and color, preview the result on the page,
and then send the annotation with a clearer target.

## Keep browser tasks scoped

Keep each browser task small enough to review in one pass.

- Name the page, route, or URL.
- Name the state you care about, such as loading, empty, error, or success.
- Leave comments on the exact elements or areas that need changes.
- Review the page again after ChatGPT finishes.
- Ask ChatGPT to start or check the development server before it opens a local
  page.

For repository changes, use the [review pane](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/code-review?surface=app) to
inspect the changes and leave comments.

<section class="feature-grid">




## Developer mode

Developer mode works with Computer Use in Chrome and the built-in browser. It
gives ChatGPT controlled access to the Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP). Use it to
profile JavaScript, inspect console output and network traffic, examine the DOM
and applied styles, or diagnose an issue in the live browser.

To enable it, open [**Settings > Browser**](codex://settings/browser-use) and,
under **Developer mode**, turn on **Enable full CDP access**. If your
organization has disabled this setting, you can't enable it locally. Admins can
set `browser_use_full_cdp_access = false` under `[features]` in
[`requirements.toml`](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/enterprise/managed-configuration#pin-feature-flags)
to disable full CDP access and prevent users from enabling the corresponding
setting in the ChatGPT desktop app.

Full CDP access can expose sensitive browser internals. ChatGPT asks for
explicit approval before it uses full CDP to inspect a website. Review the
site, task, and requested access before approving it.

Use `@Browser` for the built-in browser. To use Developer mode in Chrome,
[set up the Chrome extension](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/chrome-extension) and invoke `@Chrome`.

For example:

```text
This app is slow. Use @Browser to capture a performance trace and inspect
network traffic, then identify the bottleneck.
```

<ContentModeSwitch group="codex-surface" id="web">

With ChatGPT Work on the web, ChatGPT can use a cloud-operated browser to
research and interact with public websites. It runs separately from the
browser on your device, so you can delegate web tasks without giving ChatGPT
access to your open tabs or personal browser history.

<a id="start-a-browser-task"></a>

## Start browser work

1. Select **ChatGPT**, switch to **Work** in the switcher, and describe the result you want. Include relevant
   websites or constraints when they matter.
2. If ChatGPT needs a website, review the site-access request before allowing
   it.
3. Follow the browser's progress in the chat. Open **Cloud browser** to inspect
   the page screenshots and replay.
4. Review the result and any sources before using the information.

For example:

```text
Compare the publicly listed prices and cancellation terms for these three
venues. Return a table with links to each source and flag anything that needs a
phone call to confirm.
```

Other useful browser tasks include checking public inventory or appointment
times, gathering details from an interactive site, and comparing options whose
information is spread across several pages.

## Website permissions and confirmations

ChatGPT asks before accessing a new website by default. The permission applies
to the site shown in the request, so check the hostname before allowing it.

In ChatGPT settings, open **Cloud browser** to manage website permissions. You
can choose **Always ask**, **Auto approve**, or **Always allow**, and you can
allow or block individual sites. **Auto approve** lets ChatGPT approve requests
after its risk checks; **Always allow** removes that review step for website
access. Use the least-permissive setting that works for your task.

A website permission doesn't approve every action. ChatGPT may ask separately
for permission before performing consequential actions.

## Browser data

The cloud-operated browser keeps its cookies and browser data separate from the
browser on your device. Clearing cloud browser data doesn't clear cookies from
your device. To remove its cookies, open **Cloud browser** in ChatGPT settings,
select **Browser data**, and choose **Clear all**.

Don't rely on open pages or browser history being available in a later chat.
Include the important sites and context when you start new work.

## Limitations

- The browser supports public, signed-out websites. It can't sign in to an
  account, ask for credentials, or use the signed-in session from your browser.
- Some sites block automated browsers or require a CAPTCHA. ChatGPT may not be
  able to complete a task on those sites.
- The browser is separate from the browser on your device. It can't use your
  open tabs, extensions, saved passwords, or local browser history.
- Availability can depend on your plan, workspace settings, and rollout. It is
  available in all regions on paid plans other than Free and Go. Enterprise
  admins must enable it for their workspace.

During rollout, the browser might not appear immediately even when your plan
supports it.
