Model ID: `gpt-6-sol`

GPT-6 Sol is built for complex coding and agentic workflows.

`reasoning.effort` supports `none`, `low`, `medium` (default), `high`, `xhigh`, and `max`.
Use the Responses API for built-in tools and function calling. Chat Completions supports function calling only with `reasoning_effort` set to `none`.

EU data residency is available only with Standard processing.
See [data residency eligibility](/api/docs/guides/your-data#which-models-and-features-are-eligible-for-data-residency).

## Pricing

Pricing is based on the number of tokens used, or other metrics based on the model type. For tool-specific models, like search and computer use, there’s a fee per tool call. See details in the [pricing page](/api/docs/pricing).

### Text tokens

| Metric | Price | Unit |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Input | $2 | 1M tokens |
| Cached input | $0.2 | 1M tokens |
| Cache writes | $2.5 | 1M tokens |
| Output | $10 | 1M tokens |

- Cached input tokens are priced at 10% of the uncached input token rate.
- Cache writes are billed at 1.25x the uncached input token rate.
- Prompts with more than 272K input tokens are priced at 2x input and cache rates and 1.5x output for the full request.
- Regional processing adds a 10% premium where available. EU data residency is available only with Standard processing.
- Batch and Flex are priced at 50% of Standard rates. Fast mode is priced at 2x the applicable rates.

## Rate limits

Rate limits ensure fair and reliable access to the API by placing specific caps on requests, tokens, audio duration, or other usage within a given time period. Your usage tier determines how high these limits are set and automatically increases as you send more requests and spend more on the API.
