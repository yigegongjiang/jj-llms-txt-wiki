> Fast, high-quality everyday image generation

Model ID: `gpt-image-2.5-flare`

GPT Image 2.5 Flare is our fastest model for high-quality, everyday image generation. It accepts text and image inputs and produces image outputs. It supports `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, `max`, and `auto` quality settings. Select it directly in the Image API or as the model of the Responses API image generation tool. Learn more in the [image generation guide](/api/docs/guides/image-generation).

## Model details

- Default snapshot: `gpt-image-2.5-flare-2026-09-08`
- Input modalities: text, image
- Output modalities: image

## Pricing

Pricing is based on the number of tokens used, or other metrics based on the model type. For tool-specific models, like search and computer use, there’s a fee per tool call. See details in the [pricing page](/api/docs/pricing).

### Text tokens

| Metric | Price | Unit |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Input | $5 | 1M tokens |
| Cached input | $1.25 | 1M tokens |

### Image tokens

| Metric | Price | Unit |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Input | $8 | 1M tokens |
| Cached input | $2 | 1M tokens |
| Output | $30 | 1M tokens |

- Image output costs $30 per million tokens. Text output is not billed because this model outputs images, not text.
- Token rates match GPT Image 2. The GPT Image 2 calculator does not estimate GPT Image 2.5 token consumption.

## Rate limits

Rate limits ensure fair and reliable access to the API by placing specific caps on requests, tokens, audio duration, or other usage within a given time period. Your usage tier determines how high these limits are set and automatically increases as you send more requests and spend more on the API.

### default

| Tier | TPM | IPM |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Tier 1 | 100,000 | 5 |
| Tier 2 | 250,000 | 20 |
| Tier 3 | 800,000 | 50 |
| Tier 4 | 3,000,000 | 150 |
