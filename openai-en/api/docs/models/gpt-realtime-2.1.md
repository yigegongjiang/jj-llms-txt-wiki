Model ID: `gpt-realtime-2.1`

GPT-Realtime-2.1 updates GPT-Realtime-2 with improved alphanumeric recognition, silence and noise handling, and interruption behavior. It supports speech-to-speech interactions with configurable reasoning effort, instruction following, and tool use for complex voice-agent workflows.

## Model details

- Default snapshot: `gpt-realtime-2.1`
- Input modalities: text, audio, image
- Output modalities: text, audio
- 128,000 context window
- 32,000 max output tokens
- Sep 30, 2024 knowledge cutoff
- Reasoning token support

## Pricing

Pricing is based on the number of tokens used, or other metrics based on the model type. For tool-specific models, like search and computer use, there’s a fee per tool call. See details in the [pricing page](/api/docs/pricing).

### Text tokens

| Metric | Price | Unit |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Input | $4 | 1M tokens |
| Cached input | $0.4 | 1M tokens |
| Output | $24 | 1M tokens |

### Audio tokens

| Metric | Price | Unit |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Input | $32 | 1M tokens |
| Cached input | $0.4 | 1M tokens |
| Output | $64 | 1M tokens |

### Image tokens

| Metric | Price | Unit |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Input | $5 | 1M tokens |
| Cached input | $0.5 | 1M tokens |

- GPT-Realtime-2.1 supports configurable reasoning effort. Higher reasoning effort can increase latency and output token usage.

## Rate limits

Rate limits ensure fair and reliable access to the API by placing specific caps on requests, tokens, audio duration, or other usage within a given time period. Your usage tier determines how high these limits are set and automatically increases as you send more requests and spend more on the API.

### default

| Tier | RPM | RPD | TPM |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Tier 1 | 200 | 1,000 | 40,000 |
| Tier 2 | 400 | - | 200,000 |
| Tier 3 | 5,000 | - | 800,000 |
| Tier 4 | 10,000 | - | 4,000,000 |
| Tier 5 | 20,000 | - | 15,000,000 |
