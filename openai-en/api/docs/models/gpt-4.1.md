Model ID: `gpt-4.1`

GPT-4.1 excels at instruction following and tool calling, with broad 
knowledge across domains. It features a 1M token context window, and
low latency without a reasoning step.

Note that we recommend starting with [GPT-5](/api/docs/models/gpt-5) for complex tasks.

## Model details

## Pricing

Pricing is based on the number of tokens used, or other metrics based on the model type. For tool-specific models, like search and computer use, there’s a fee per tool call. See details in the [pricing page](/api/docs/pricing).

## Rate limits

Rate limits ensure fair and reliable access to the API by placing specific caps on requests, tokens, audio duration, or other usage within a given time period. Your usage tier determines how high these limits are set and automatically increases as you send more requests and spend more on the API.

| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Tier 1 | 500 | 30,000 | 90,000 |
