Model ID: `gpt-5.6-sol`

GPT-5.6 Sol is the frontier model in the GPT-5.6 family. It roughly
corresponds to the unsuffixed model tier used in earlier GPT-5 families.
The `gpt-5.6` alias routes requests to GPT-5.6 Sol.
Reasoning.effort supports: none, low, medium (default), high, xhigh, and max.

## Model details

- Input modalities: text, image
- Output modalities: text
- 1,050,000 context window
- Maximum input tokens: 922,000
- 128,000 max output tokens
- Feb 16, 2026 knowledge cutoff

## Pricing

Pricing is based on the number of tokens used, or other metrics based on the model type. For tool-specific models, like search and computer use, there’s a fee per tool call. See details in the [pricing page](/api/docs/pricing).

### Text tokens

| Metric | Price | Unit |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Input | $5 | 1M tokens |
| Cached input | $0.5 | 1M tokens |
| Output | $30 | 1M tokens |

- Prompts with >272K input tokens are priced at 2x input and 1.5x output for the full request.
- Cache writes are billed at 1.25x the uncached input token rate.

## Rate limits

Rate limits ensure fair and reliable access to the API by placing specific caps on requests, tokens, audio duration, or other usage within a given time period. Your usage tier determines how high these limits are set and automatically increases as you send more requests and spend more on the API.

### Standard

| Tier | RPM | TPM | Batch queue limit |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Tier 1 | 500 | 500,000 | 1,500,000 |
| Tier 2 | 5,000 | 1,000,000 | 3,000,000 |
| Tier 3 | 5,000 | 2,000,000 | 100,000,000 |
| Tier 4 | 10,000 | 4,000,000 | 200,000,000 |
| Tier 5 | 15,000 | 40,000,000 | 15,000,000,000 |
