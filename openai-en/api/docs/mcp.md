# Building MCP servers for plugins and API integrations

[Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) (MCP) is an open protocol that's becoming the industry standard for extending AI models with additional tools and knowledge. Remote MCP servers can be used to connect models over the Internet to new data sources and capabilities.

In this guide, we'll cover how to build a remote MCP server that reads data from a private data source (a [vector store](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/retrieval)) and makes it available through a plugin in ChatGPT and Codex, through ChatGPT deep research and company knowledge, and [through the API](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/deep-research).

**Note**: To build a plugin with an MCP server, start with the plugin docs: [Quickstart](https://developers.openai.com/plugins/quickstart), [Build your MCP server](https://developers.openai.com/plugins/build/mcp-server), [Connect and test your plugin](https://developers.openai.com/plugins/deploy/connect-chatgpt), and [Authentication](https://developers.openai.com/plugins/build/auth). If your MCP server doesn't need UI, you can expose tools without UI resources.

## Configure a data source

You can use data from any source to power a remote MCP server, but for simplicity, we will use [vector stores](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/retrieval) in the OpenAI API. Begin by uploading a PDF document to a new vector store - [you can use this public domain 19th century book about cats](https://cdn.openai.com/API/docs/cats.pdf) for an example.

You can upload files and create a vector store [in the dashboard here](https://platform.openai.com/storage/vector_stores), or you can create vector stores and upload files via API. [Follow the vector store guide](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/retrieval) to set up a vector store and upload a file to it.

Make a note of the vector store's unique ID to use in the example to follow.

![vector store configuration](https://cdn.openai.com/API/docs/images/vector_store.png)

## Create an MCP server

Next, let's create a remote MCP server that will do search queries against our vector store, and be able to return document content for files with a given ID.

In this example, we are going to build our MCP server using Python and [FastMCP](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp). A full implementation of the server appears at the end of this section, along with instructions for running it in a [browser-based development environment](https://replit.com/).

Note that there are a number of other MCP server frameworks you can use in a variety of programming languages. Whichever framework you use though, the tool definitions in your server will need to conform to the shape described here.

To work with ChatGPT deep research and company knowledge (and deep research via API), your MCP server should implement two read-only tools: `search` and `fetch`, using the compatibility schema in [Company knowledge compatibility](https://developers.openai.com/plugins/build/mcp-server#company-knowledge-compatibility).

Declare an output schema for each tool so clients can validate the result shape.
In FastMCP, typed return models can generate this schema automatically; the
example below passes `output_schema` explicitly from the same models.

### `search` tool

The `search` tool is responsible for returning a list of relevant search results from your MCP server's data source, given a user's query.

_Arguments:_

A single query string.

_Returns:_

An object with a single key, `results`, whose value is an array of result objects. Each result object should include:

- `id` - a unique ID for the document or search result item
- `title` - human-readable title.
- `url` - canonical URL for citation.

In MCP, return this object as `structuredContent` and include the same value as
a JSON-encoded string in the [content array](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/learn/architecture#understanding-the-tool-execution-response)
for compatibility.

The final tool response should look like:

```json
{
  "structuredContent": {
    "results": [{ "id": "doc-1", "title": "...", "url": "..." }]
  },
  "content": [
    {
      "type": "text",
      "text": "{\"results\":[{\"id\":\"doc-1\",\"title\":\"...\",\"url\":\"...\"}]}"
    }
  ]
}
```

### `fetch` tool

The fetch tool is used to retrieve the full contents of a search result document or item.

_Arguments:_

A string which is a unique identifier for the search document.

_Returns:_

A single object with the following properties:

- `id` - a unique ID for the document or search result item
- `title` - a string title for the search result item
- `text` - The full text of the document or item
- `url` - a URL to the document or search result item. Useful for citing
  specific resources in research.
- `metadata` - an optional key/value pairing of data about the result

In MCP, return this object as `structuredContent` and include the same value as
a JSON-encoded string in the content array for compatibility.

The final tool response should look like:

```json
{
  "structuredContent": {
    "id": "doc-1",
    "title": "...",
    "text": "full text...",
    "url": "https://example.com/doc",
    "metadata": { "source": "vector_store" }
  },
  "content": [
    {
      "type": "text",
      "text": "{\"id\":\"doc-1\",\"title\":\"...\",\"text\":\"full text...\",\"url\":\"https://example.com/doc\",\"metadata\":{\"source\":\"vector_store\"}}"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Citation behavior

For both `search` results and `fetch` responses, ChatGPT creates citation
metadata only when `url` is a non-empty string. A result with a `title` but no
usable `url` remains ordinary tool output instead of becoming an empty
citation. To make a result citable, return its canonical `url`.

For example, ChatGPT might call `search` with:

```json
{ "query": "What is the quarterly plan?" }
```

The MCP server can respond with a URL-backed result:

```json
{
  "structuredContent": {
    "results": [
      {
        "id": "quarterly-plan",
        "title": "Quarterly plan",
        "url": "https://example.com/quarterly-plan"
      }
    ]
  },
  "content": [
    {
      "type": "text",
      "text": "{\"results\":[{\"id\":\"quarterly-plan\",\"title\":\"Quarterly plan\",\"url\":\"https://example.com/quarterly-plan\"}]}"
    }
  ]
}
```

In this response, the `url` field has a value, which makes the result eligible
for citation metadata. The query itself does not trigger citation handling. If
the result omits `url`, or provides an empty or non-string value, ChatGPT
preserves the result as ordinary tool output.

### Server example

You can try this example MCP server in a [browser-based development environment](https://replit.com/). Configure the sample with your own API credentials and vector store information.

Replit setup

On Replit, you will need to configure two environment variables in the "Secrets" UI:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - Your standard OpenAI API key
- `VECTOR_STORE_ID` - The unique identifier of a vector store that can be used for search - the one you created earlier.

On free Replit accounts, server URLs are active for as long as the editor is active, so while you are testing, you'll need to keep the browser tab open. You can get a URL for your MCP server by clicking on the chainlink icon:

![replit configuration](https://cdn.openai.com/API/docs/images/replit.png)

In the long dev URL, ensure it ends with `/sse/`, which is the server-sent events (streaming) interface to the MCP server. This is the URL you will use to connect your app in ChatGPT and call it via API. An example Replit URL looks like:

```
https://777xxx.janeway.replit.dev/sse/
```

## Test and connect your MCP server

You can test your MCP server with a deep research model [in the prompts dashboard](https://platform.openai.com/chat). Create a new prompt, or edit an existing one, and add a new MCP tool to the prompt configuration. Remember that MCP servers used via API for deep research have to be configured with no approval required.

If you are testing this server as part of a plugin, follow [Connect and test your plugin](https://developers.openai.com/plugins/deploy/connect-chatgpt).

![prompts configuration](https://cdn.openai.com/API/docs/images/prompts_mcp.png)

Once you have configured your MCP server, you can chat with a model using it via the Prompts UI.

![prompts chat](https://cdn.openai.com/API/docs/images/chat_prompts_mcp.png)

You can test the MCP server using the Responses API directly with a request like this one:

```bash
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/responses \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
  "model": "o4-mini-deep-research",
  "input": [
    {

          "text": "You are a research assistant that searches MCP servers to find answers to your questions."
        }
      ]
    },

        "fetch"
      ],
      "require_approval": "never"
    }
  ]
}'
```


### Handle authentication

As someone building a custom remote MCP server, authorization and authentication help you protect your data. We recommend using OAuth with [Client ID Metadata Documents](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-11-25/basic/authorization#client-id-metadata-documents) for client registration when your authorization server supports CIMD and the plugin creator chooses it. ChatGPT supports CIMD with public-client token exchange (`none`) or signed client assertion token exchange (`private_key_jwt`). Dynamic client registration remains supported when configured. For plugin authentication requirements, see [Authentication](https://developers.openai.com/plugins/build/auth). For protocol details, read the [MCP user guide](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/transports#authentication-and-authorization) or the [authorization specification](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-11-25/basic/authorization).

If you connect your custom remote MCP server through a plugin, users in your workspace will get an OAuth flow to your service.

### Connect in ChatGPT

1. In [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com), open **Settings → Security and login** and turn on **Developer mode**.
1. Open **Settings → Plugins** or the [Plugins directory](https://chatgpt.com/plugins), select the plus button, and connect your server URL in developer mode.
1. Test your plugin by running prompts in chat and deep research.

For detailed setup steps, see [Connect and test your plugin](https://developers.openai.com/plugins/deploy/connect-chatgpt).

## Risks and safety

Custom MCP servers enable you to connect your ChatGPT workspace to external applications, which allows ChatGPT to access, send and receive data in these applications. Please note that custom MCP servers are not developed or verified by OpenAI, and are third-party services that are subject to their own terms and conditions.

If you come across a malicious MCP server, please report it to security@openai.com.

### Prompt injection-related risks

Prompt injections are a form of attack where an attacker embeds malicious instructions in content that one of our models is likely to encounter–such as a webpage–with the intention that the instructions override ChatGPT’s intended behavior. If the model obeys the injected instructions it may take actions the user and developer never intended—including sending private data to an external destination.

For example, you might ask ChatGPT to find a restaurant for a group dinner by checking your calendar and recent emails. While researching, it might encounter a malicious comment—essentially a harmful piece of content designed to trick the agent into performing unintended actions—directing it to retrieve a password reset code from Gmail and send it to a malicious website.

Below is a table of specific scenarios to consider. We recommend reviewing this table carefully to inform your decision about whether to use custom MCPs.

| Scenario / Risk                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Is it safe if I trust the MCP’s developer?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | What can I do to reduce risk?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| A malicious MCP may request excessive parameters to a read or write action. <br /><br />_Example:_<br />• An employee flight booking MCP could expose a read action to get a flight schedule, but request parameters including `summaryOfConversation`, `userAnnualIncome`, `userHomeAddress`.                                                                                                                                        | Trusting a MCP’s developer does not necessarily make this safe.<br /><br />A MCP’s developer may consider it reasonable to be requesting certain data that you do not consider acceptable to share.                                                                                              | • When installing MCP servers manually, review the parameters requested for each action and ensure there is no privacy overreach.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| An attacker may use a prompt injection attack to trick ChatGPT into fetching sensitive data from a custom MCP, to then be sent to the attacker. <br /><br />_Example:_<br />• An attacker may deliver a prompt injection attack to one of the enterprise users via a different MCP (for example, email), where the attack attempts to trick ChatGPT into reading sensitive data from an internal tool and sending it to the attacker. | Trusting a MCP’s developer does not make this safe.<br /><br />Everything within the new MCP could be safe and trusted since the risk is this data being stolen by attacks coming from a different malicious source.                                                                             | • _ChatGPT is designed to protect users_, but attackers may attempt to steal your data, so be aware of the risk and consider whether taking it makes sense.<br />• Configure access to minimize how many people have access to MCPs with particularly sensitive data.                                                          |
| An attacker may use a prompt injection attack to leak sensitive information through a write action to a custom MCP. <br /><br />_Example:_<br />• An attacker uses a prompt injection attack through a different MCP to trick ChatGPT into fetching sensitive data, then using an MCP for a customer support system to send it to the attacker.                                                                                       | Trusting a MCP’s developer does not make this safe.<br /><br />Even if you fully trust the MCP, if write actions have any consequences that can be observed by an attacker, they could attempt to take advantage of it.                                                                          | • Users should review write actions carefully when they happen (to ensure they were intended and do not contain any data that shouldn’t be shared).                                                                                                                                                                            |
| An attacker may use a prompt injection attack to leak sensitive information through a read action to a malicious custom MCP because the MCP can log these actions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | This attack only works if the MCP is malicious, or if the MCP incorrectly marks write actions as read actions.<br /><br />If you trust a MCP’s developer to correctly only mark read actions as _read_, and trust that developer to not attempt to steal data, then this risk is likely minimal. | • Only use MCPs from developers that you trust (though note this isn’t sufficient to make it safe).                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| An attacker may use a prompt injection attack to trick ChatGPT into taking a harmful or destructive write action via a custom MCP that users did not intend.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Trusting a MCP’s developer does not make this safe.<br /><br />Everything within the new MCP could be safe and trusted, and this risk still exists since the attack comes from a different malicious source.                                                                                     | • Users should carefully review write actions to ensure they are intended and correct.<br />• ChatGPT is designed to protect users, but attackers may attempt to trick ChatGPT into taking unintended write actions.<br />• Configure access to minimize how many people have access to MCPs with particularly sensitive data. |

### Non-prompt injection related risks

Custom MCPs introduce other risks unrelated to prompt injection attacks:

- **Write actions can increase both the usefulness and the risks of MCP servers**, because they make it possible for the server to take potentially destructive actions rather than only providing information back to ChatGPT. ChatGPT currently requires manual confirmation in any conversation before write actions can be taken. The confirmation will flag potentially sensitive data but you should only use write actions in situations where you have carefully considered, and are comfortable with, the possibility that ChatGPT might make a mistake involving such an action. It is possible for write actions to occur even if the MCP server has tagged the action as read only, making it even more important that you trust the custom MCP server before deploying to ChatGPT.
- **Any MCP server may receive sensitive data as part of querying**. Even when the server is not malicious, it will have access to whatever data ChatGPT supplies during the interaction, potentially including sensitive data the user may earlier have provided to ChatGPT. For instance, such data could be included in queries ChatGPT sends to the MCP server when using deep research or chat app tools.

### Connecting to trusted servers

We recommend that you do not connect to a custom MCP server unless you know and trust the underlying application.

For example, choose official servers hosted by the service providers themselves. Connect to the Stripe server hosted by Stripe at `mcp.stripe.com` instead of an unofficial Stripe MCP server hosted by a third party. Because few official MCP servers are available today, you may consider a server hosted by an organization that proxies requests to another service through an API. Only connect after you have reviewed how the organization uses your data and verified that you can trust the server. When building and connecting to your own MCP server, double-check that it's the correct server. Be careful about the data you provide in response to requests and how you treat data sent to you when OpenAI calls your MCP server.

Your remote MCP server permits others to connect OpenAI to your services and allows OpenAI to access, send and receive data, and take action in these services. Avoid putting any sensitive information in the JSON for your tools, and avoid storing any sensitive information from ChatGPT users accessing your remote MCP server.

As someone building an MCP server, don't put anything malicious in your tool definitions.
