See the [application-managed](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/tree/main/examples/agents_api/sandboxes/blaxel/application_managed) and [webhook-managed](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/tree/main/examples/agents_api/sandboxes/blaxel/webhook_managed) examples in the OpenAI Cookbook.

See [Self-hosted sandboxes](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/agents-api/environments/self-hosted) for executor setup and connection requirements.

Choose a provisioning mode:

- **[Application-managed](#before-you-begin):** Follow this guide to start and stop sandboxes from your application.
- **[Webhook-managed](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/agents-api/environments/lifecycle#set-up-webhook-managed-sandboxes):** Deploy a handler that starts or reconnects sandboxes from OpenAI webhooks.

See [Sandbox lifecycle](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/agents-api/environments/lifecycle) to compare the two modes.

## Before you begin

You need an OpenAI project API key, a Blaxel API key and workspace, and the Codex CLI package.

Set `BL_API_KEY` and `BL_WORKSPACE`, and use `OPENAI_API_KEY` for application requests. Set `OPENAI_EXECUTOR_API_KEY` to an [environment key](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/agents-api/environments/self-hosted#authentication), and pass only that key into the sandbox as `CODEX_API_KEY`.

Choose the sandbox region in your provisioning code. Use `us-was-1` if you need the Agent Drive persistence option below.

## 1. Set up the Blaxel environment

Create a [self-hosted session](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/agents-api/environments/self-hosted#create-or-reuse-a-session) and save its environment ID. Use the Blaxel SDK or API to create an isolated sandbox with the configured working directory. Install the Codex CLI in the sandbox, then [start its executor](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/agents-api/environments/self-hosted#start-the-executor) with that environment ID and the environment key.

The Blaxel Node image uses Alpine Linux, so install `ripgrep` with `apk`. Pass the environment key as `CODEX_API_KEY` only to the executor process. Set `keep_alive=True` to prevent the sandbox from scaling to zero while the executor runs. Bounded setup, executor, and sandbox timeouts prevent abandoned resources from running indefinitely.

For regular use, build a Blaxel image with Codex and `ripgrep` already installed so the sandbox can connect sooner.

## 2. Run the session

Use the HTTP examples in [Run and continue sessions](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/agents-api/sessions) to send input and stream the result after the Blaxel executor connects. When finished, [delete the session](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/agents-api/sessions/manage#delete-a-session) and stop the provider sandbox separately.

Start the sandbox before submitting input. The turn waits for the environment to connect, and the session reports the connection through `agent.session.environment.connected` on the event stream.

Use `agent.session.turn.completed` to identify a successful turn. A failed or cancelled turn can also be followed by `agent.session.idle`, so do not treat an idle session as proof that the turn succeeded.

## Optional: Persist files between sessions

Use [Blaxel Agent Drive](https://docs.blaxel.ai/Agent-drive/Overview) to preserve files across sandboxes and sessions. Mount the same drive in each sandbox to share files; Agent Drive requires the `us-was-1` region and does not transfer conversation history or session state.
