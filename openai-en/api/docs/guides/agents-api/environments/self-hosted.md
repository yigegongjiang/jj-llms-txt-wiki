# Self-hosted sandboxes

Connect your own environment when you want more control over the agent's environment or want to use compute you trust. The environment can be a laptop, a container, or a remote sandbox. To have OpenAI provision the environment, use an [OpenAI-hosted sandbox](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/agents-api/environments/openai-hosted).




## How the connection works

OpenAI runs the [agent harness](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/agents-api/architecture#the-pieces). You run `codex exec-server`, the executor, inside your environment. It runs shell commands, reads and writes files, and uses local MCP servers at the harness's request.

The executor registers with the API using an environment ID and a restricted API key. It then connects over WebSocket to receive commands and return results. All connections are outbound. The executor reconnects if the connection drops.

## Prepare your environment

Prepare the files and dependencies your agent needs. Isolate environments by user or workload. Agents that share an environment can access the same files, credentials, and other resources.

Create the working directory and install the Codex CLI inside the environment. This example uses `/workspace`:

```bash
mkdir -p /workspace
npm install -g @openai/codex@alpha
```




### Network access

Allow outbound connections to these hosts:

- `https://api.openai.com` for environment registration.
- `wss://codex-cloud-environments.chatgpt.com` for commands and results.

### Authentication

Use `OPENAI_API_KEY` for application requests. Grant it `api.agents.read` and `api.agents.write` for session operations, plus `api.responses.write` for model inference. Add `api.vaults.read` and `api.vaults.write` if your application manages vaults.

Create a separate environment key on the [Agents tab](https://platform.openai.com/agents?tab=environments&environment_view=keys) in the platform dashboard. It must belong to the same organization, project, and user or service account that owns the session. Set every other permission to **None**.

Set `OPENAI_EXECUTOR_API_KEY` to this environment key in your application or provisioning service. Pass its value into the sandbox as `CODEX_API_KEY`, which `codex exec-server` reads. Keep your application's `OPENAI_API_KEY` outside the sandbox.

Agent-generated code can read the environment key, but the key only permits connecting environments. It cannot authorize any other API action. Keep it out of source code, container images, and logs. Rotate or revoke it when needed.




## Create a session

Run this example in your application, outside the environment. If you already have a self-hosted session, reuse it.

Create a session with your own environment

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";
const client = new OpenAI();

const session = await client.beta.agents.sessions.create({
  agent: {
    model: "gpt-6-astra",
    instructions:
      "You are a helpful coding assistant. Write clean code and verify that it works.",
  },
  environment: {
    type: "self_hosted",
    workspace_directory: "/workspace",
  },
});

console.log(session);
```

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

session = client.beta.agents.sessions.create(
    agent={
        "model": "gpt-6-astra",
        "instructions": "You are a helpful coding assistant. Write clean code and verify that it works.",
    },
    environment={"type": "self_hosted", "workspace_directory": "/workspace"},
)
print(session.to_json())
```

```go
import (
	"context"
	"fmt"

	"github.com/openai/openai-go/v3"
)

ctx := context.Background()
client := openai.NewClient()
result, err := client.Beta.Agents.Sessions.New(ctx,
	openai.BetaAgentSessionNewParams{
		Agent: openai.BetaAgentSessionNewParamsAgent{
			Model:        openai.String("gpt-6-astra"),
			Instructions: openai.String("You are a helpful coding assistant. Write clean code and verify that it works."),
		},
		Environment: openai.EnvironmentParamUnion{
			OfParamSelfHosted: &openai.EnvironmentParamSelfHosted{WorkspaceDirectory: "/workspace"},
		},
	})
if err != nil {
	panic(err)
}
fmt.Println(result)
```

```java
import com.openai.client.OpenAIClient;
import com.openai.client.okhttp.OpenAIOkHttpClient;
import com.openai.models.beta.agents.EnvironmentParam;
import com.openai.models.beta.agents.sessions.SessionCreateParams;

OpenAIClient client = OpenAIOkHttpClient.fromEnv();
var result =
    client
        .beta()
        .agents()
        .sessions()
        .create(
            SessionCreateParams.builder()
                .agent(
                    SessionCreateParams.Agent.builder()
                        .model("gpt-6-astra")
                        .instructions(
                            "You are a helpful coding assistant. Write clean code and verify"
                                + " that it works.")
                        .build())
                .environment(
                    EnvironmentParam.SelfHosted.builder()
                        .workspaceDirectory("/workspace")
                        .build())
                .build());
System.out.println(result);
```

```ruby
require "openai"

client = OpenAI::Client.new
result = client.beta.agents.sessions.create(
  agent: {
    model: "gpt-6-astra",
    instructions: "You are a helpful coding assistant. Write clean code and verify that it works."
  },
  environment: {
    type: "self_hosted",
    workspace_directory: "/workspace"
  }
)
puts result
```


Store `session.id` with your application's conversation state. Pass `session.environment.id` and `session.environment.remote_url` to the executor. Use the remote URL unchanged, including when reconnecting. See [Configuring Agents](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/agents-api/configuration#reuse-an-agent-across-sessions) to use a stored agent.




You can reuse your environment image, `workspace_directory`, and `capability_directories` across sessions. Each session has its own environment ID and needs its own executor. API [environment templates](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/agents-api/tools/plugins#reuse-a-hosted-plugin-setup) apply only to OpenAI-hosted environments.

## Start the executor

Open the [session event stream](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/agents-api/sessions/events#consume-a-stream) from your application to receive connection events. Then run this command inside the environment with the environment key configured as `CODEX_API_KEY` above. Replace the placeholders with the environment values returned by the API:

```bash
codex exec-server \
  --remote "<session.environment.remote_url>" \
  --environment-id "<session.environment.id>"
```

Leave the executor running while the agent works.




## Send work and monitor the connection

[Send input](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/agents-api/sessions#send-input) from your application while the event stream stays open. The agent needs both a connected environment and user input to start work.

The stream reports these connection states:

- `agent.session.environment.pending`: The session is waiting for the executor to connect.
- `agent.session.environment.connected`: The environment is ready.
- `agent.session.environment.failed`: The connection failed. Check the environment error and executor logs.

Continue following the stream for the turn's outcome and output. See [Environment lifecycle](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/agents-api/environments/lifecycle) to manage startup, reconnection, and shutdown from your application or through webhooks.

## Sandbox providers

Choose a sandbox provider to run code and work with files. See [Sandbox lifecycle](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/agents-api/environments/lifecycle) to compare application-managed and webhook-managed provisioning.

For webhook-managed provisioning, implement a handler using [Sandbox lifecycle](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/agents-api/environments/lifecycle#start-compute-from-webhooks) and your provider's SDK or API. Keep provisioning ownership and cleanup policies explicit.
