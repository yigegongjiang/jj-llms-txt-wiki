# Prompt generation

> For the complete documentation index, see [llms.txt](/llms.txt). Markdown versions of documentation pages are available by appending `.md` to the page URL.

The **Generate** button in the [Playground](https://platform.openai.com/chat/edit) lets you generate prompts, [functions](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/function-calling), and [schemas](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/structured-outputs#supported-schemas) from just a description of your task. This guide will walk through exactly how it works.

## Overview

Creating prompts and schemas from scratch can be time-consuming, so generating them can help you get started quickly. The Generate button uses two main approaches:

1. **Prompts:** We use **meta-prompts** that incorporate best practices to generate or improve prompts.
1. **Schemas:** We use **meta-schemas** that produce valid JSON and function syntax.

While we currently use meta prompts and schemas, we may integrate more advanced techniques in the future like [DSPy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03714) and ["Gradient Descent"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03495).

## Prompts

A **meta-prompt** instructs the model to create a good prompt based on your task description or improve an existing one. The meta-prompts in the Playground draw from our [prompt engineering](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/prompt-engineering) best practices and real-world experience with users.

We use specific meta-prompts for different output types, like audio, to ensure the generated prompts meet the expected format.

# Guidelines

- Understand the Task: Grasp the main objective, goals, requirements, constraints, and expected output.
- Minimal Changes: If an existing prompt is provided, improve it only if it's simple. For complex prompts, enhance clarity and add missing elements without altering the original structure.
- Reasoning Before Conclusions**: Encourage reasoning steps before any conclusions are reached. ATTENTION! If the user provides examples where the reasoning happens afterward, REVERSE the order! NEVER START EXAMPLES WITH CONCLUSIONS!
    - Reasoning Order: Call out reasoning portions of the prompt and conclusion parts (specific fields by name). For each, determine the ORDER in which this is done, and whether it needs to be reversed.
    - Conclusion, classifications, or results should ALWAYS appear last.
- Examples: Include high-quality examples if helpful, using placeholders [in brackets] for complex elements.
   - What kinds of examples may need to be included, how many, and whether they are complex enough to benefit from placeholders.
- Clarity and Conciseness: Use clear, specific language. Avoid unnecessary instructions or bland statements.
- Formatting: Use markdown features for readability. DO NOT USE ``` CODE BLOCKS UNLESS SPECIFICALLY REQUESTED.
- Preserve User Content: If the input task or prompt includes extensive guidelines or examples, preserve them entirely, or as closely as possible. If they are vague, consider breaking down into sub-steps. Keep any details, guidelines, examples, variables, or placeholders provided by the user.
- Constants: DO include constants in the prompt, as they are not susceptible to prompt injection. Such as guides, rubrics, and examples.
- Output Format: Explicitly the most appropriate output format, in detail. This should include length and syntax (e.g. short sentence, paragraph, JSON, etc.)
    - For tasks outputting well-defined or structured data (classification, JSON, etc.) bias toward outputting a JSON.
    - JSON should never be wrapped in code blocks (```) unless explicitly requested.

The final prompt you output should adhere to the following structure below. Do not include any additional commentary, only output the completed system prompt. SPECIFICALLY, do not include any additional messages at the start or end of the prompt. (e.g. no "---")

Given a task description or existing prompt, produce a detailed system prompt to guide a realtime audio output language model in completing the task effectively.

# Guidelines

- Understand the Task: Grasp the main objective, goals, requirements, constraints, and expected output.
- Tone: Make sure to specifically call out the tone. By default it should be emotive and friendly, and speak quickly to avoid keeping the user just waiting.
- Audio Output Constraints: Because the model is outputting audio, the responses should be short and conversational.
- Minimal Changes: If an existing prompt is provided, improve it only if it's simple. For complex prompts, enhance clarity and add missing elements without altering the original structure.
- Examples: Include high-quality examples if helpful, using placeholders [in brackets] for complex elements.
   - What kinds of examples may need to be included, how many, and whether they are complex enough to benefit from placeholders.
  - It is very important that any examples included reflect the short, conversational output responses of the model.
Keep the sentences very short by default. Instead of 3 sentences in a row by the assistant, it should be split up with a back and forth with the user instead.
  - By default each sentence should be a few words only (5-20ish words). However, if the user specifically asks for "short" responses, then the examples should truly have 1-10 word responses max.
  - Make sure the examples are multi-turn (at least 4 back-forth-back-forth per example), not just one questions an response. They should reflect an organic conversation.
- Clarity and Conciseness: Use clear, specific language. Avoid unnecessary instructions or bland statements.
- Preserve User Content: If the input task or prompt includes extensive guidelines or examples, preserve them entirely, or as closely as possible. If they are vague, consider breaking down into sub-steps. Keep any details, guidelines, examples, variables, or placeholders provided by the user.

### Prompt edits

To edit prompts, we use a slightly modified meta-prompt. While direct edits are straightforward to apply, identifying necessary changes for more open-ended revisions can be challenging. To address this, we include a **reasoning section** at the beginning of the response. This section helps guide the model in determining what changes are needed by evaluating the existing prompt's clarity, chain-of-thought ordering, overall structure, and specificity, among other factors. The reasoning section makes suggestions for improvements and is then parsed out from the final response.

## Schemas

[Structured Outputs](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/structured-outputs) schemas and function schemas are themselves JSON objects, so we leverage Structured Outputs to generate them.
This requires defining a schema for the desired output, which in this case is itself a schema. To do this, we use a self-describing schema – a **meta-schema**.

Because the `parameters` field in a function schema is itself a schema, we use the same meta-schema to generate functions.

### Defining a constrained meta-schema

[Structured Outputs](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/structured-outputs) supports two modes: `strict=true` and `strict=false`. Both modes use the same model trained to follow the provided schema, but only "strict mode" guarantees perfect adherence through constrained sampling.

Our goal is to generate schemas for strict mode using strict mode itself. However, the official meta-schemas provided by the [JSON Schema Specification](https://json-schema.org/specification#meta-schemas) rely on features [not currently supported](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/structured-outputs#some-type-specific-keywords-are-not-yet-supported) in strict mode. This poses challenges that affect both input and output schemas.

1. **Input schema:** We can't use [unsupported features](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/structured-outputs#some-type-specific-keywords-are-not-yet-supported) in the input schema to describe the output schema.
2. **Output schema:** The generated schema must not include [unsupported features](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/structured-outputs#some-type-specific-keywords-are-not-yet-supported).

Because we need to generate new keys in the output schema, the input meta-schema must use `additionalProperties`. This means we can't currently use strict mode to generate schemas. However, we still want the generated schema to conform to strict mode constraints.

To overcome this limitation, we define a **pseudo-meta-schema** — a meta-schema that uses features not supported in strict mode to describe only the features that are supported in strict mode. Essentially, this approach steps outside strict mode for the meta-schema definition while still ensuring that the generated schemas adhere to strict mode constraints.



Constructing a constrained meta-schema is a challenging task, so we leveraged our models to help.

We began by giving `o1-preview` and `gpt-4o` in JSON mode a description of our goal using the Structured Outputs documentation.
After a few iterations, we developed our first functional meta-schema.

We then used `gpt-4o` with Structured Outputs and provided _that initial schema_ along with our task description and documentation, to generate better candidates. With each iteration we used a better schema to generate the next, until we finally reviewed it carefully by hand.

Finally, after cleaning the output, we validated the schemas against a set of evals for schemas and functions.



### Output cleaning

Strict mode guarantees perfect schema adherence. Because we can't use it during generation, however, we need to validate and transform the output after generating it.

After generating a schema, we perform the following steps:

1. **Set `additionalProperties` to `false`** for all objects.
1. **Mark all properties as required**.
1. **For structured output schemas**, wrap them in [`json_schema`](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/structured-outputs#how-to-use?context=without_parse) object.
1. **For functions**, wrap them in a [`function`](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/function-calling#step-3-pass-your-function-definitions-as-available-tools-to-the-model-along-with-the-messages) object.

The Realtime API
  [function](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/realtime-conversations#function-calling) object
  differs slightly from the Chat Completions API, but uses the same schema.

### Meta-schemas

Each meta-schema has a corresponding prompt which includes few-shot examples. When combined with the reliability of Structured Outputs — even without strict mode — we were able to generate schemas.

    - because of this, some cases like "attributes" or "metadata" properties that would normally allow additional properties should instead have a fixed set of properties
- all objects must have properties defined
- field order matters. any form of "thinking" or "explanation" should come before the conclusion
- $defs must be defined under the schema param

Notable keywords NOT supported include:
- For objects: unevaluatedProperties, propertyNames, minProperties, maxProperties
- For arrays: unevaluatedItems, contains, minContains, maxContains, uniqueItems

Other notes:
- definitions and recursion are supported
- only if necessary to include references e.g. "$defs", it must be inside the "schema" object

# Instructions
Return a valid schema for the described function.

Pay special attention to making sure that "required" and "type" are always at the correct level of nesting. For example, "required" should be at the same level as "properties", not inside it.
Make sure that every property, no matter how short, has a type and description correctly nested inside it.
