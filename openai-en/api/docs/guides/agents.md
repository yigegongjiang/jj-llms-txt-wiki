# Agents SDK

Agents are applications that plan, call tools, collaborate across specialists, and keep enough state to complete multi-step work.

## Get your first agent running

Start with the [Agents SDK quickstart](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/agents/quickstart) to install the SDK, define one agent, and run it. Once that works, return here to choose the next capability your application needs.

## Get the Agents SDK

Use the GitHub repositories for more examples, issues, and language-specific reference details.

## Build with the SDK

Use the SDK track when your server owns deployment, tool implementations, state storage, and approval decisions, while the SDK runs the agent loop and invokes those tools. That path is the best fit when you want:

- typed application code in TypeScript or Python
- direct control over tools, MCP servers, and runtime behavior
- custom storage or server-managed conversation strategies
- tight integration with existing product logic or infrastructure

A typical SDK reading order is:

- Start with [Quickstart](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/agents/quickstart) to get one working run on screen.
- Use [Agent definitions](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/agents/define-agents) and [Models and providers](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/agents/models) to shape one specialist cleanly.
- Continue to [Running agents](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/agents/running-agents), [Orchestration and handoffs](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/agents/orchestration), and [Guardrails and human review](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/agents/guardrails-approvals) as the workflow grows more complex.
- Use [Results and state](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/agents/results) and [Integrations and observability](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/agents/integrations-observability) when application logic depends on the run object or deeper visibility into behavior.

## Agents SDK vs. Responses API

Use the Responses API when you want to own the loop. Use the Agents SDK when you want the SDK to run it.

### Choose the Responses API when

- You want direct control over model interactions, output items, tools, state, and orchestration, whether the workflow takes one call or many.
- You want to implement custom tool routing, loops, or branching directly in your application.

In the [Responses function-calling flow](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/function-calling#the-tool-calling-flow), your application receives function calls, executes them, returns their output, and calls the model again.

For example, a Responses API workflow might search a knowledge base and generate a cited answer.

### Choose the Agents SDK when

- You want the SDK to manage the agent loop and recurring orchestration such as repeated tool calls or branching.
- Different specialists need different instructions, tools, or policies.
- You want built-in sessions, tracing, guardrails, or resumable approval flows.

The [Agents SDK runner](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/agents/running-agents#the-agent-loop) performs the tool loop, switches agents after handoffs, and stops when the run finishes or pauses for approval.

For example, an Agents SDK workflow might investigate a support request, hand it to the correct specialist, call internal systems, request approval for a refund, and record the result.
