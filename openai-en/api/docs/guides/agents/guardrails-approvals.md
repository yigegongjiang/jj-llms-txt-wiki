# Guardrails and human review

Use guardrails for automatic checks and human review for approval decisions. Together, they define when a run should continue, pause, or stop.

- **Guardrails** validate input, output, or tool behavior automatically.
- **Human review** pauses the run so a person or policy can approve or reject a sensitive action.

## Choose the right control

| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Block disallowed user requests before the main model runs                                     | Input guardrails            |
| Validate or redact the final output before it leaves the system                               | Output guardrails           |
| Check arguments or results around a function tool call                                        | Tool guardrails             |
| Pause before side effects like cancellations, edits, shell commands, or sensitive MCP actions | Human-in-the-loop approvals |

## Add a blocking guardrail

Use input guardrails when you want a fast validation step to run before the expensive or side-effecting part of the workflow starts.

Block a request with an input guardrail

```typescript
import { Agent, InputGuardrailTripwireTriggered, run } from "@openai/agents";
import { z } from "zod";

const guardrailAgent = new Agent({
  name: "Homework check",
  instructions: "Detect whether the user is asking for math homework help.",
  outputType: z.object({
    isMathHomework: z.boolean(),
    reasoning: z.string(),
  }),
});

const agent = new Agent({
  name: "Customer support",
  instructions: "Help customers with support questions.",
  inputGuardrails: [
    {
      name: "Math homework guardrail",
      runInParallel: false,
      async execute({ input, context }) {
        const result = await run(guardrailAgent, input, { context });
        return {
          outputInfo: result.finalOutput,
          tripwireTriggered: result.finalOutput?.isMathHomework === true,
        };
      },
    },
  ],
});

try {
  await run(agent, "Can you solve 2x + 3 = 11 for me?");
} catch (error) {
  if (error instanceof InputGuardrailTripwireTriggered) {
    console.log("Guardrail blocked the request.");
  }
}
```

```python
import asyncio

from pydantic import BaseModel

from agents import (
    Agent,
    GuardrailFunctionOutput,
    InputGuardrailTripwireTriggered,
    RunContextWrapper,
    Runner,
    TResponseInputItem,
    input_guardrail,
)


class MathHomeworkOutput(BaseModel):
    is_math_homework: bool
    reasoning: str


guardrail_agent = Agent(
    name="Homework check",
    instructions="Detect whether the user is asking for math homework help.",
    output_type=MathHomeworkOutput,
)


@input_guardrail
async def math_guardrail(
    ctx: RunContextWrapper[None],
    agent: Agent,
    input: str | list[TResponseInputItem],
) -> GuardrailFunctionOutput:
    result = await Runner.run(guardrail_agent, input, context=ctx.context)
    return GuardrailFunctionOutput(
        output_info=result.final_output,
        tripwire_triggered=result.final_output.is_math_homework,
    )


agent = Agent(
    name="Customer support",
    instructions="Help customers with support questions.",
    input_guardrails=[math_guardrail],
)


async def main() -> None:
    try:
        await Runner.run(agent, "Can you solve 2x + 3 = 11 for me?")
    except InputGuardrailTripwireTriggered:
        print("Guardrail blocked the request.")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```


Use blocking execution when the cost or risk of starting the main agent is too high. Use parallel guardrails when lower latency matters more than avoiding speculative work.

## Pause for human review

Approvals are the human-in-the-loop path for tool calls. The model can still decide that an action is needed, but the run pauses until you approve or reject it.

Pause for approval before a sensitive action

```typescript
import { Agent, run, tool } from "@openai/agents";
import { z } from "zod";

const cancelOrder = tool({
  name: "cancel_order",
  description: "Cancel a customer order.",
  parameters: z.object({ orderId: z.number() }),
  needsApproval: true,
  async execute({ orderId }) {
    return `Cancelled order ${orderId}`;
  },
});

const agent = new Agent({
  name: "Support agent",
  instructions: "Handle support requests and ask for approval when needed.",
  tools: [cancelOrder],
});

let result = await run(agent, "Cancel order 123.");

if (result.interruptions?.length) {
  const state = result.state;
  for (const interruption of result.interruptions) {
    state.approve(interruption);
  }
  result = await run(agent, state);
}

console.log(result.finalOutput);
```

```python
import asyncio

from agents import Agent, Runner, function_tool


@function_tool(needs_approval=True)
async def cancel_order(order_id: int) -> str:
    return f"Cancelled order {order_id}"


agent = Agent(
    name="Support agent",
    instructions="Handle support requests and ask for approval when needed.",
    tools=[cancel_order],
)


async def main() -> None:
    result = await Runner.run(agent, "Cancel order 123.")

    if result.interruptions:
        state = result.to_state()
        for interruption in result.interruptions:
            state.approve(interruption)
        result = await Runner.run(agent, state)

    print(result.final_output)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```


This same interruption pattern applies even when the approving tool lives deeper in the workflow, such as after a handoff or inside a nested call.

## Approval lifecycle

When a tool call needs review, the SDK follows the same pattern every time:

1. The run records an approval interruption instead of executing the tool.
2. The result returns `interruptions` plus a resumable `state`.
3. Your application approves or rejects the pending items.
4. You resume the same run from `state` instead of starting a new user turn.

If the review might take time, serialize `state`, store it, and resume later. That's still the same run.

## Workflow boundaries matter

Agent-level guardrails don't run everywhere:

- Input guardrails run only for the first agent in the chain.
- Output guardrails run only for the agent that produces the final output.
- Tool guardrails run on the function tools they're attached to.

If you need checks around every custom tool call in a manager-style workflow, don't rely only on agent-level input or output guardrails. Put validation next to the tool that creates the side effect.

## Streaming and delayed review use the same state model

Streaming doesn't create a separate approval system. If a streamed run pauses, wait for it to settle, inspect `interruptions`, resolve the approvals, and resume from the same `state`. If the review happens later, store the serialized state and continue the same run when the decision arrives.
