# Models and providers

Every SDK run eventually resolves a model and a transport. Most applications should keep that setup straightforward: choose models explicitly, use the standard OpenAI path by default, and reach for provider or transport overrides only when the workflow actually needs them.

## Start with explicit model selection

In production, prefer explicit model choice over whichever runtime default your SDK release happens to ship with.

- Set `model` on an agent when that specialist consistently needs a different quality, latency, or cost profile.
- Set a run-level default when one workflow should override several agents at once.
- Set `OPENAI_DEFAULT_MODEL` when you want a process-wide fallback for agents that omit `model`.

Set models per agent and per run

```typescript
import { Agent, Runner } from "@openai/agents";

const fastAgent = new Agent({
  name: "Fast support agent",
  instructions: "Handle routine support questions.",
  model: "gpt-5.6-terra",
});

const generalAgent = new Agent({
  name: "General support agent",
  instructions: "Handle support questions carefully.",
});

const runner = new Runner({
  model: "gpt-5.6",
});

await runner.run(fastAgent, "Summarize ticket 123.");
const result = await runner.run(
  generalAgent,
  "Investigate the billing issue on account 456."
);

console.log(result.finalOutput);
```

```python
import asyncio

from agents import Agent, RunConfig, Runner

fast_agent = Agent(
    name="Fast support agent",
    instructions="Handle routine support questions.",
    model="gpt-5.6-terra",
)

general_agent = Agent(
    name="General support agent",
    instructions="Handle support questions carefully.",
)


async def main() -> None:
    await Runner.run(fast_agent, "Summarize ticket 123.")

    result = await Runner.run(
        general_agent,
        "Investigate the billing issue on account 456.",
        run_config=RunConfig(model="gpt-5.6"),
    )
    print(result.final_output)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```


For most new SDK workflows, start with [`gpt-5.6`](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/models/gpt-5.6-sol) and move to a smaller variant only when latency or cost matters enough to justify it. Use the platform-wide <a href="/api/docs/guides/latest-model">Model guidance</a> page for current model-selection advice.

## Choose the simplest default strategy

| If you need                                    | Start with                | Why                                                                                  |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| One explicit model per specialist              | Set `model` on each agent | The workflow stays readable in code and traces                                       |
| One fallback across a whole process            | `OPENAI_DEFAULT_MODEL`    | Agents that omit `model` still resolve predictably                                   |
| One workflow-level override                    | A run-level default       | You can swap models for a script, worker, or environment without editing every agent |
| Different model sizes across the same workflow | Mix per-agent models      | A fast triage agent and a slower deep specialist can coexist cleanly                 |

If your team cares about the exact default, don't rely on the SDK fallback. Set it yourself.

## Providers and transport

| Need                                                    | Start with                                                        |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Standard SDK runs on OpenAI                             | The default OpenAI provider path                                  |
| Many repeated Responses model round trips over a socket | Responses WebSocket transport in the SDK                          |
| Non-OpenAI models or a mixed-provider stack             | The provider or adapter surface in the language-specific SDK docs |

Two distinctions matter:

- The Responses WebSocket transport still uses the normal text-and-tools agent loop. It's separate from the voice session path.
- Live audio sessions over WebRTC or WebSocket are for low-latency voice or image interactions. Use [Voice agents](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/voice-agents) and the [live audio API guide](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/realtime) for that path.

Exact provider configuration, provider lifecycle management, and transport helper APIs remain language-specific material. Keep those details in the SDK docs instead of duplicating them here.

## Model settings, prompts, and feature support

Model choice is only part of the runtime contract.

- Use for tuning such as reasoning effort, verbosity, and tool behavior.
- Use `prompt` when you want a stored prompt configuration to control the run instead of embedding the full system prompt in code.
- Some SDK features depend on the OpenAI Responses path rather than older compatibility surfaces, so check the SDK docs when you need advanced tool-loading or transport features.

Keep the model contract close to the agent definition when it's intrinsic to that specialist. Move it to a workflow-level default only when a group of agents should share the same runtime choice.

## Next steps

Once the runtime contract is clear, continue with the guide that matches the rest of the workflow design.
