# Spend limits

Use spend alerts to track monthly API costs. To stop traffic after tracked spend reaches a configured amount, enforce a hard spend limit for your organization or an individual project.

Hard spend limits can interrupt production traffic. When tracked spend reaches
  an applicable hard limit, affected API requests return a `429` error with the
  `insufficient_quota` code. Enforcement is not instantaneous, so recorded spend
  can slightly exceed the configured amount.

## Choose a spend control

Spend alerts and hard spend limits have different effects:

| Control          | What happens at the configured amount       | Use it when you want to                       |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Spend alert      | Sends a notification; API traffic continues | Track spend without interrupting traffic      |
| Hard spend limit | Affected API requests return a `429` error  | Enforce a monthly organization or project cap |

Spend alerts do not enforce a cap. They remain active when you add a hard spend limit, so you can use alerts for notification before a hard limit interrupts traffic.

OpenAI also assigns your organization an approved monthly [usage limit based on its usage tier](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/rate-limits#usage-tiers). This OpenAI-approved usage limit is separate from the spend limits you configure.

## Configure a spend limit

You need permission to manage the applicable organization or project settings. For details, see [API Platform permissions](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/rbac).



<div data-content-switcher-pane data-value="organization">
    <div class="hidden">Organization</div>

1. Go to [Organization limits](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/limits).
2. In **Spend**, select **Edit spend limit**.
3. Enter the **Monthly spend limit**.
4. To make API responses fail after the organization reaches the limit, turn on **Enforce a hard limit**.
5. Select **Save**.

  </div>
  <div data-content-switcher-pane data-value="project" hidden>
    <div class="hidden">Project</div>

1. Go to [Project settings](https://platform.openai.com/settings/).
2. Select **Limits**.
3. In **Spend**, select **Edit spend limit**.
4. Enter the **Monthly spend limit**.
5. To make API responses fail after the project reaches the limit, turn on **Enforce a hard limit**.
6. Select **Save**.

## Understand hard-limit behavior

Organization and project hard limits can both apply to a request:

- An organization hard limit applies to API traffic across all projects in the organization.
- A project hard limit applies only to API traffic billed to that project.
- Reaching either applicable hard limit causes affected requests to return `429` errors with the `insufficient_quota` code.
- Raising or removing the reached limit allows traffic to resume after the update propagates. Otherwise, the limit resets with the next monthly cycle.

Enforcement is not instantaneous. The API Platform can process a small amount of extra usage while the limit state propagates, so recorded spend can slightly exceed the configured amount.

## Spend alerts

Use spend alerts to get notified before spend reaches a hard limit. Add alerts at thresholds that allow time to adjust usage, raise the limit, or investigate unexpected traffic.

## Restore API traffic

If requests return quota-related `429` errors:

1. Compare [current usage](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/usage) with the organization and project spend limits that apply to the request.
2. Raise or remove the reached hard limit if traffic should resume before the monthly reset.
3. If tracked spend is below every applicable hard limit, check whether the organization exhausted prepaid credits or reached its OpenAI-approved usage limit.
4. If the error reports a request or token rate limit instead of `insufficient_quota`, follow the [rate limit guide](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/rate-limits).
