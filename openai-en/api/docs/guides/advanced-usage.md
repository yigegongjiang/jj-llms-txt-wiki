# Advanced usage

OpenAI's text generation models (often called generative pre-trained transformers or large language models) have been trained to understand natural language, code, and images. The models provide text outputs in response to their inputs. The text inputs to these models are also referred to as "prompts." Designing a prompt is essentially how you “program” a large language model, usually by providing instructions or some examples of how to successfully complete a task.

## Reproducible outputs

Chat Completions are non-deterministic by default (which means model outputs may differ from request to request). That being said, we offer some control towards deterministic outputs by giving you access to the [`seed`](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/api-reference/chat/create#chat-create-seed) parameter and the [`system_fingerprint`](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/api-reference/completions/object#completions/object-system_fingerprint) response field.

To receive (mostly) deterministic outputs across API calls, you can:

- Set the [seed](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/api-reference/chat/create#chat-create-seed) parameter to any integer of your choice and use the same value across requests you'd like deterministic outputs for.
- Ensure all other parameters (like `prompt` or `temperature`) are the exact same across requests.

Sometimes, determinism may be impacted due to necessary changes OpenAI makes to model configurations on our end. To help you keep track of these changes, we expose the [`system_fingerprint`](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/api-reference/chat/object#chat/object-system_fingerprint) field. If this value is different, you may see different outputs due to changes we've made on our systems.

## Managing tokens

Language models read and write text in chunks called tokens. In English, a token can be as short as one character or as long as one word (for example, `a` or ` apple`), and in some languages tokens can be even shorter than one character or even longer than one word.

As a rough rule of thumb, 1 token is approximately 4 characters or 0.75 words for English text.

  to test specific strings and see how they are translated into tokens.

For example, the string `"ChatGPT is great!"` is encoded into six tokens: `["Chat", "G", "PT", " is", " great", "!"]`.

The total number of tokens in an API call affects:

- How much your API call costs, as you pay per token
- How long your API call takes, as writing more tokens takes more time
- Whether your API call works at all, as total tokens must be below the model's maximum limit (4097 tokens for `gpt-3.5-turbo`)

Both input and output tokens count toward these quantities. For example, if your API call used 10 tokens in the message input and you received 20 tokens in the message output, you would be billed for 30 tokens. Note however that for some models the price per token is different for tokens in the input vs. the output (see the [pricing](https://openai.com/api/pricing) page for more information).

To see how many tokens are used by an API call, check the `usage` field in the API response (for example, `response['usage']['total_tokens']`).

Chat models like `gpt-3.5-turbo` and `gpt-4-turbo-preview` use tokens in the same way as the models available in the completions API, but because of their message-based formatting, it's more difficult to count how many tokens will be used by a conversation.



Below is an example function for counting tokens for messages passed to `gpt-3.5-turbo-0613`.

The exact way that messages are converted into tokens may change from model to model. So when future model versions are released, the answers returned by this function may be only approximate.

```python
def num_tokens_from_messages(messages, model="gpt-3.5-turbo-0613"):
    """Returns the number of tokens used by a list of messages."""
    try:
        encoding = tiktoken.encoding_for_model(model)
    except KeyError:
        encoding = tiktoken.get_encoding("cl100k_base")
    if model == "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613":  # note: future models may deviate from this
        num_tokens = 0
        for message in messages:
            num_tokens += (
                4  # every message follows <im_start>{role/name}\n{content}<im_end>\n
            )
            for key, value in message.items():
                num_tokens += len(encoding.encode(value))
                if key == "name":  # if there's a name, the role is omitted
                    num_tokens += -1  # role is always required and always 1 token
        num_tokens += 2  # every reply is primed with <im_start>assistant
        return num_tokens
    raise ValueError(
        f"num_tokens_from_messages() only supports gpt-3.5-turbo-0613, not {model}."
    )
```


Next, create a message and pass it to the function defined above to see the token count, this should match the value returned by the API usage parameter:

```python
messages = [
    {
        "role": "system",
        "content": "You are a helpful, pattern-following assistant that translates corporate jargon into plain English.",
    },
    {
        "role": "system",
        "name": "example_user",
        "content": "New synergies will help drive top-line growth.",
    },
    {
        "role": "system",
        "name": "example_assistant",
        "content": "Things working well together will increase revenue.",
    },
    {
        "role": "system",
        "name": "example_user",
        "content": "Let's circle back when we have more bandwidth to touch base on opportunities for increased leverage.",
    },
    {
        "role": "system",
        "name": "example_assistant",
        "content": "Let's talk later when we're less busy about how to do better.",
    },
    {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "This late pivot means we don't have time to boil the ocean for the client deliverable.",
    },
]

model = "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613"

print(f"{num_tokens_from_messages(messages, model)} prompt tokens counted.")
# Should show ~126 total_tokens
```


To confirm the number generated by our function above is the same as what the API returns, create a new Chat Completion:

```python
# example token count from the OpenAI API
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model=model,
    messages=messages,
    temperature=0,
)

print(f"{response.usage.prompt_tokens} prompt tokens used.")
```



To see how many tokens are in a text string without making an API call, use OpenAI’s [tiktoken](https://github.com/openai/tiktoken) Python library. Example code can be found in the OpenAI Cookbook’s guide on [how to count tokens with tiktoken](https://developers.openai.com/cookbook/examples/how_to_count_tokens_with_tiktoken).

Each message passed to the API consumes the number of tokens in the content, role, and other fields, plus a few extra for behind-the-scenes formatting. This may change slightly in the future.

If a conversation has too many tokens to fit within a model’s maximum limit (for example, more than 4097 tokens for `gpt-3.5-turbo` or more than 128k tokens for `gpt-4o`), you will have to truncate, omit, or otherwise shrink your text until it fits. Beware that if a message is removed from the messages input, the model will lose all knowledge of it.

Note that long conversations are more likely to receive incomplete replies. For example, a `gpt-3.5-turbo` conversation that is 4090 tokens long will have its reply cut off after just 6 tokens.

## Parameter details

### Frequency and presence penalties

The frequency and presence penalties found in the [Chat Completions API](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/api-reference/chat/create) and [Legacy Completions API](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/api-reference/completions) can be used to reduce the likelihood of sampling repetitive sequences of tokens.



They work by directly modifying the logits (un-normalized log-probabilities) with an additive contribution.

```python
mu[j] = mu[j] - c[j] * alpha_frequency - float(c[j] > 0) * alpha_presence
```


Where:

- `mu[j]` is the logits of the j-th token
- `c[j]` is how often that token was sampled prior to the current position
- `float(c[j] > 0)` is 1 if `c[j] > 0` and 0 otherwise
- `alpha_frequency` is the frequency penalty coefficient
- `alpha_presence` is the presence penalty coefficient

As we can see, the presence penalty is a one-off additive contribution that applies to all tokens that have been sampled at least once and the frequency penalty is a contribution that is proportional to how often a particular token has already been sampled.



Reasonable values for the penalty coefficients are around 0.1 to 1 if the aim is to just reduce repetitive samples somewhat. If the aim is to strongly suppress repetition, then one can increase the coefficients up to 2, but this can noticeably degrade the quality of samples. Negative values can be used to increase the likelihood of repetition.

### Token log probabilities

The [`logprobs`](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/api-reference/chat/create#chat-create-logprobs) parameter found in the [Chat Completions API](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/api-reference/chat/create) and [Legacy Completions API](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/api-reference/completions), when requested, provides the log probabilities of each output token, and a limited number of the most likely tokens at each token position alongside their log probabilities. This can be useful in some cases to assess the confidence of the model in its output, or to examine alternative responses the model might have given.
