## July, 2026

### Jul 22

Feature

Added hard spend limits for organizations and projects on the OpenAI API platform. Set a monthly cap that causes affected API requests to return a `429` error when tracked spend reaches the limit. Use spend alerts for notification before traffic is interrupted. Read more in the [spend limits guide](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/spend-limits).

### Jul 9

Feature · Model: gpt-5.6-sol · Model: gpt-5.6-terra · Model: gpt-5.6-luna · API: v1/responses · API: v1/chat/completions · API: v1/batch

Released the [GPT-5.6 model family](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/latest-model), including GPT-5.6 Sol for frontier capability, GPT-5.6 Terra for a balance of intelligence and cost, and GPT-5.6 Luna for efficient, high-volume workloads. The `gpt-5.6` alias routes requests to `gpt-5.6-sol`.

GPT-5.6 adds [Programmatic Tool Calling](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/tools-programmatic-tool-calling), [explicit prompt caching controls](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/prompt-caching), [persisted reasoning, `max` reasoning effort, and Pro mode](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/reasoning), and [Multi-agent orchestration in beta for the Responses API](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/responses-multi-agent). GPT-5.6 also accepts images at their original dimensions with `original` or `auto` image detail.

### Jul 6

Released [GPT-Realtime-2.1](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/models/gpt-realtime-2.1), an updated realtime reasoning model with improved alphanumeric recognition, silence and noise handling, and interruption behavior. Also released [GPT-Realtime-2.1 mini](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/models/gpt-realtime-2.1-mini), a faster, lower-cost distilled reasoning model for realtime voice applications.

## June, 2026

### Jun 24

Update · Model: chat-latest

Updated the `chat-latest` snapshot, which points to the latest Instant model currently used in ChatGPT. We recommend leveraging [GPT-5.5](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/models/gpt-5.5) for production API usage, but feel free to use this model to test the latest improvements for chat use cases. The underlying model snapshot will be regularly updated. Read more [here](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/models/chat-latest).

### Jun 9

Feature · API: v1/responses

Web search can now return image results alongside regular text results. Use image search when your application needs current or web-grounded visuals, such as product photos, landmarks, places, events, or visual references. Read more in the [web search guide](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/tools-web-search).

### Jun 5

Update

Learn more in the [Moderation guide](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/moderation#moderate-generated-content).

### Jun 3

Update

Announced the deprecation of reusable prompt objects, the Evals platform, and Agent Builder. See the [deprecations page](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/deprecations) for shutdown timelines and migration guidance.

### Jun 2

Update

Starting June 2, 2026, eligible container sessions will be billed per minute with a 5-minute minimum, instead of being billed at the full 20-minute session rate. The underlying per-minute rate will remain the same.

This update is intended to make billing more granular for shorter sessions and will lower effective cost for customers.

You can find current built-in tool pricing in our [API pricing docs](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/pricing#built-in-tools).
