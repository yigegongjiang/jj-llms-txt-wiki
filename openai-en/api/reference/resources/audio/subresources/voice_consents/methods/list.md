## List voice consents

**get** `/audio/voice_consents`

Returns a list of voice consent recordings.

### Query Parameters

  - `id: string`

    The consent recording identifier.

  - `created_at: number`

    The Unix timestamp (in seconds) for when the consent recording was created.

  - `language: string`

    The BCP 47 language tag for the consent phrase (for example, `en-US`).

  - `name: string`

    The label provided when the consent recording was uploaded.

    The object type, which is always `audio.voice_consent`.
