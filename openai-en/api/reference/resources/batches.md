## Create batch

**post** `/batches`

Creates and executes a batch from an uploaded file of requests

### Body Parameters

- `completion_window: "24h"`

  The time frame within which the batch should be processed. Currently only `24h` is supported.

  - `"24h"`

- `endpoint: "/v1/responses" or "/v1/chat/completions" or "/v1/embeddings" or 5 more`

  The endpoint to be used for all requests in the batch. Currently `/v1/responses`, `/v1/chat/completions`, `/v1/embeddings`, `/v1/completions`, `/v1/moderations`, `/v1/images/generations`, `/v1/images/edits`, and `/v1/videos` are supported. Note that `/v1/embeddings` batches are also restricted to a maximum of 50,000 embedding inputs across all requests in the batch.

  - `"/v1/responses"`

  - `"/v1/chat/completions"`

  - `"/v1/embeddings"`

  - `"/v1/completions"`

  - `"/v1/moderations"`

  - `"/v1/images/generations"`

  - `"/v1/images/edits"`

  - `"/v1/videos"`

- `input_file_id: string`

  The ID of an uploaded file that contains requests for the new batch.

  See [upload file](/docs/api-reference/files/create) for how to upload a file.

  Your input file must be formatted as a [JSONL file](/docs/api-reference/batch/request-input), and must be uploaded with the purpose `batch`. The file can contain up to 50,000 requests, and can be up to 200 MB in size.

- `metadata: optional Metadata`

  Set of 16 key-value pairs that can be attached to an object. This can be
  useful for storing additional information about the object in a structured
  format, and querying for objects via API or the dashboard.

  Keys are strings with a maximum length of 64 characters. Values are strings
  with a maximum length of 512 characters.

- `output_expires_after: optional object { anchor, seconds }`

  The expiration policy for the output and/or error file that are generated for a batch.

  - `anchor: "created_at"`

    Anchor timestamp after which the expiration policy applies. Supported anchors: `created_at`. Note that the anchor is the file creation time, not the time the batch is created.

    - `"created_at"`

  - `seconds: number`

    The number of seconds after the anchor time that the file will expire. Must be between 3600 (1 hour) and 2592000 (30 days).

## List batches

**get** `/batches`

List your organization's batches.

### Query Parameters

- `after: optional string`

  A cursor for use in pagination. `after` is an object ID that defines your place in the list. For instance, if you make a list request and receive 100 objects, ending with obj_foo, your subsequent call can include after=obj_foo in order to fetch the next page of the list.

- `limit: optional number`

  A limit on the number of objects to be returned. Limit can range between 1 and 100, and the default is 20.
