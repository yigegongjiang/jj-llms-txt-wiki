## Upload file

**post** `/files`

Upload a file that can be used across various endpoints. Individual files
can be up to 512 MB, and each project can store up to 2.5 TB of files in
total. There is no organization-wide storage limit. Uploads to this
endpoint are rate-limited to 1,000 requests per minute per authenticated
user.

- The Assistants API supports files up to 2 million tokens and of specific
  file types. See the [Assistants Tools guide](/docs/assistants/tools) for
  details.
- The Fine-tuning API only supports `.jsonl` files. The input also has
  certain required formats for fine-tuning
  [chat](/docs/api-reference/fine-tuning/chat-input) or
  [completions](/docs/api-reference/fine-tuning/completions-input) models.
- The Batch API only supports `.jsonl` files up to 200 MB in size. The input
  also has a specific required
  [format](/docs/api-reference/batch/request-input).
- For Retrieval or `file_search` ingestion, upload files here first. If
  you need to attach multiple uploaded files to the same vector store, use
  [`/vector_stores/{vector_store_id}/file_batches`](/docs/api-reference/vector-stores-file-batches/createBatch)
  instead of attaching them one by one. Vector store attachment has separate
  limits from file upload, including 2,000 attached files per minute per
  organization.

Please [contact us](https://help.openai.com/) if you need to increase these
storage limits.

    - `"file"`

  - `purpose: "assistants" or "assistants_output" or "batch" or 5 more`

    The intended purpose of the file. Supported values are `assistants`, `assistants_output`, `batch`, `batch_output`, `fine-tune`, `fine-tune-results`, `vision`, and `user_data`.

    - `"assistants"`

    - `"assistants_output"`

    - `"batch"`
